1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,460
hey how you doing this is Mel strong and

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,460
this lecture is on how to identify and

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,350
name clouds now we're not going to talk

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,090
about the processes that actually form

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,279
the clouds that will be in a future

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,619
lecture but here what we're doing is

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,240
we're learning a naming system that was

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,609
developed by Luke Howard a couple

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,590
hundred years ago Luke Howard was a

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,080
pharmacist and he just really liked

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,350
clouds and he painted paintings of

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,110
clouds and then in 1802 he published a

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,030
classification system because up to that

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,129
point there wasn't one and his

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,590
classification system isn't perfect but

16
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,210
it's still in use today and his cloud

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,579
names are still in use today so that's

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,530
what we're gonna learn and in his system

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,510
you need to know two things to name a

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,579
cloud you need to know the clouds shape

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,610
and you need to know the clouds height

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,090
above the ground now as far as shape

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,850
goes all clouds in this system have to

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,500
fall into one of three possible shapes

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,150
cumuliform strata form of C reform and

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,780
I'll show you examples of these shapes

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,159
in in a minute and then for height we

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,680
just have three categories of heights

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,869
little middle and high and with those

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,299
three shapes and those three Heights we

31
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,320
come up with ten different cloud names

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,570
in this system so first we're going to

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,180
go through the shapes and cumuliform

34
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,280
shape clouds are also known as heap

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,650
clouds these are the clouds if it kind

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,130
of puffy looking they might kind of look

37
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,930
like cotton or cauliflower and they

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,030
might be wider than they are tall they

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,700
might be taller than they are wide they

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,189
might be just a little tiny puff balls

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,649
they may be low droopy clouds but all of

42
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,710
these have something in common which is

43
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,259
they all have this kind of puffy edge on

44
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,020
them right so these are all Kimo form

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,810
clouds now the stratiform clouds are a

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,610
lot more boring and they're sometimes

47
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,829
called the layered clouds they're like

48
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,409
these big blankets to cover the sky and

49
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,540
so you don't usually see a lot of

50
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,690
features within these clouds maybe you

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,819
can see the Sun poking through maybe not

52
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,100
but just think of like a big solid gray

53
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,200
sky and

54
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,170
that's a stratiform cloud usually can't

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,660
see the edges of these then

56
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,690
xeroform are the clouds that are kind of

57
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,310
wispy or curly or hairy sometimes

58
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,920
they'll they'll have little hooks on the

59
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,770
end sometimes not here's some that have

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,470
little heads with whole feathery trails

61
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,540
leading off of them these are pretty

62
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,280
straight so there's a lot of varieties

63
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,810
in in ceará form clouds now we've talked

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,360
about the three shapes let's talk about

65
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,470
the three heights and in order to

66
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,790
understand these this little middle high

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,460
terminology we have to explain a little

68
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,770
bit how the atmosphere is structured and

69
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,800
so let's imagine that we've got a

70
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,530
mountain range here and we were let's

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,660
say to launch a balloon up into the air

72
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,120
above this mountain range and on the

73
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,710
balloon we put a temperature sensor so

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,930
it could tell us what the temperature is

75
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,780
which is what a weather balloon actually

76
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,300
does and so if we had a balloon and we

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,010
let it launch and we collected all this

78
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,950
data as it climbs up into the atmosphere

79
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,120
and then we took all that data let's

80
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,420
just say it's collecting temperature

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,900
data and we made a plot right and in my

82
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,850
plot I've got an x-axis of temperature

83
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,350
so it's warmer to the right colder to

84
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,760
the left and I plot height on the y-axis

85
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,400
and I were to plot that data that that

86
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,740
balloon measured my graph would look

87
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,420
kind of like this at first the balloon

88
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,000
would notice its warmest near the

89
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,830
surface and as it goes up into the

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,900
atmosphere cools and cools with height

91
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,280
and that probably makes sense to you

92
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,370
because if you go up to the top of a

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,050
mountain it's usually colder up there

94
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,220
we'll learn in a later lecture that when

95
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,230
the sunlight passes through the

96
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,810
atmosphere it really doesn't interact

97
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,550
with it it warms the ground and the

98
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,220
ground warms the atmosphere from the

99
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,650
bottom but for now all we have to

100
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,440
realize is that this this trend happens

101
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,540
and then at some point something weird

102
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,670
happens the our little weather balloon

103
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,340
would notice that the air actually

104
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,900
starts warming up as it gets when it

105
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,470
gets to a certain point and continues to

106
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,120
warm up as you go higher okay now in a

107
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,520
later lecture we'll explain more about

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
why this happens but for now all we're

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,820
going to say is that

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,190
this little inflection point between

111
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,200
where the atmosphere cools with height

112
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,720
and when it starts to warm with height

113
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,640
that that forms a natural boundary

114
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,950
between two layers in the atmosphere and

115
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,170
all the air below that line is called

116
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,560
the troposphere and all air above that

117
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,970
line is called the stratosphere so the

118
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,520
reason we're talking about this is this

119
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,340
little middle/high business that refers

120
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,820
to low middle high in this layer in the

121
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,490
bottom layer of the atmosphere now the

122
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,830
exact height of this varies by season

123
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,020
they can vary by day if it's a really

124
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,970
cold day it will be lower if it's a hot

125
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,350
day it'll be higher if you're in the

126
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,540
tropics it's higher if you're near that

127
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:12,350
pulls it slower but kind of worldwide

128
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:14,690
average is close to seven miles above

129
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,540
the ground is where this division is so

130
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,120
our low middle high clouds have to fall

131
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,450
somewhere between close to the ground

132
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,960
level and up to as high as maybe seven

133
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,350
miles

134
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,490
so roughly we just divide that like this

135
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,169
low clouds middle calls high clouds now

136
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,660
there's a problem with this and that we

137
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,970
don't have a word for a cloud that's in

138
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,460
here or a cloud that's in here so we

139
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,830
kind of have to force clouds to fall

140
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,180
into one of these three categories so

141
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,500
like I said it's not it's not

142
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:52,669
necessarily a perfect system so the high

143
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:56,680
and mid clouds have a prefix so if a

144
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:59,930
cloud is up here we give it a prefix 0

145
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,510
and if a cloud is kind of around here we

146
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,750
give it a prefix Alto if the cloud is

147
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,250
down here it does not have a prefix this

148
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,130
will make more sense when I give you

149
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,700
some examples ok so let's start with one

150
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:16,970
I have a quinoa form cloud and it's low

151
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,590
I call it cumulus all right now I take

152
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,530
that puffy cloud and I move it up to

153
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:24,470
kind of the middle of the troposphere I

154
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,480
would call that Alto cumulus either

155
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,700
looks smaller and I'll show you pictures

156
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,400
of these in a second but that also tells

157
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,710
you the mid level of the atmosphere or

158
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,500
the troposphere if I move that puffy

159
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,900
cloud up higher you know again peer up

160
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,720
here even smaller and it'll have that

161
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,950
prefix 0

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,690
you can do the same thing with Stratus

163
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,720
cones it works a little bit differently

164
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,720
so here's a high Stratus cloud a blanket

165
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,430
that would be cirrostratus with also

166
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,650
Stratus usually what that means is that

167
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,560
that high cloud extends all the way down

168
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,730
to the middle of the atmosphere at

169
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,520
middle of the troposphere that's

170
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,860
altostratus and if it extends down

171
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,750
almost to the ground doesn't have to

172
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,920
touch it but gets low we'll call that

173
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,320
Stratus so again there's no prefix here

174
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,240
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go

175
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,130
through some pictures of some of these

176
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,240
clouds and we're gonna learn

177
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,710
the cloud names that we're going to

178
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,330
learn how to identify them so first

179
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,970
we're gonna start with chemo and chemo s

180
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,300
are probably the most commonly known

181
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,910
cloud these are the clouds that you see

182
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,970
on a summer day a lot of times here in

183
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,350
New Mexico and if you watch this for a

184
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,260
while you'll see the clouds will grow

185
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,240
and they'll die and they kind of drift

186
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,220
around but they're not getting too

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,590
terribly large now these are considered

188
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,730
low clouds and this is one of the things

189
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,990
you kind of have to get used to is

190
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,000
recognizing what we call a little cloud

191
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,350
and what we call middle cloud and the

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,590
high cloud so everything I'm showing you

193
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,820
here are low clouds if you ever lay in

194
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,530
your back and you're looking up at

195
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,800
shapes changing in the clouds you're

196
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,820
probably looking at cumulus clouds

197
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,650
sometimes especially here in New Mexico

198
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,660
in the summer they'll have flat bottoms

199
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,780
that's not always the case but that's a

200
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,700
common feature that they have so

201
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,070
depending on when you look they may have

202
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,250
different proportions so right here that

203
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,840
one's wider than it is tall but as I sit

204
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,660
here and watch this grow now it's the

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,610
same height as it is wide and then as I

206
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,820
wait I can see now it's getting taller

207
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,530
than it is wide and later in a later

208
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,360
lecture we will talk all about though

209
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,000
what's happening here and like why this

210
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,969
is why this cloud is growing but the

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,890
point is the proportions can be totally

212
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,390
different just depending on when you're

213
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,460
looking so you know this cloud is

214
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,099
clearly getting pretty tall

215
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,290
it started out you know lighter than it

216
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,600
was tall but it's changing that as the

217
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,190
day progresses so here's some for

218
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,010
example that just about as tall as they

219
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,790
are wide notice that these are also have

220
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:59,020
mostly flat bottoms here

221
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,020
here's one that's taller than it is wide

222
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,980
so here's a typical summer day in New

223
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,380
Mexico we've got a bunch of little

224
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,420
cumulus clouds here and if you watch

225
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,820
them for a while you'll see one being

226
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,460
born and then you watch it and pretty

227
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,370
soon it will die and dissipate and they

228
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,490
just continue to be born live for a

229
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:24,440
while and die as the day continues so

230
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:26,750
these are all cumulus most importantly

231
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,390
when the opening credits of The Simpsons

232
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,450
occurs the clouds that they show are

233
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,940
cumulus clouds and in fact in the city

234
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,170
where they live

235
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,530
cumulus clouds are the only cause they

236
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,360
ever have that show so now let's move up

237
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,920
to Alto cumulus clouds so now these are

238
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,060
going to be higher above the ground so

239
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,680
naturally they're going to appear

240
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,690
smaller because they're farther away

241
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,190
from us but the clouds themselves are

242
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:54,740
actually also smaller and here's some

243
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,720
typical Alto cumulus so these are

244
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,570
considered mid cloud so and so now these

245
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,190
are not low and these are considerably

246
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:08,330
further up in the atmosphere you can see

247
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:12,740
how they're smaller and often they will

248
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:15,490
kind of form a patchwork pattern cumulus

249
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,710
clouds are more kind of randomly spaced

250
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,270
altocumulus often form these patterns

251
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,460
kind of like what we're seeing here like

252
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,050
a patchwork again sometimes they'll be

253
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,490
touching each other sometimes they won't

254
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:30,440
be touching each other another example

255
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,440
so everything we're seeing here is a

256
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,270
mid-level cloud and so nothing here is

257
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,970
considered low levels again this is what

258
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,760
takes some practice to get used to here

259
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,350
they're all touching and these clouds

260
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,850
are a little bit lower than the previous

261
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,340
slides but these are still considered

262
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,230
altocumulus clouds and here you can't

263
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,670
even see the sky so that's that is a

264
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,220
possibility that they could form a

265
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,760
continuous blanket of cloud okay so

266
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,830
that's altocumulus they don't

267
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,380
necessarily have to be independent

268
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,190
little puff balls a lot of times they'll

269
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,740
align themselves in rows and we call

270
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,990
this Anjali artists but all you need to

271
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,480
know here is that these

272
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,930
actually aligned rows of altocumulus

273
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,930
clouds so still puffy clouds still

274
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,830
mid-level in the troposphere alright

275
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:23,230
let's go on to cirrocumulus and because

276
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:26,740
they're so high up these are little tiny

277
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,020
puffy clouds that you can actually kind

278
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,810
of see through right like white was

279
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,120
shining through cirrocumulus clouds

280
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,350
because they're so thin and you know

281
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,690
they're tiny because they're far away

282
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,820
but they're also literally very thin

283
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:45,010
clouds and zero cumulus clouds often

284
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,589
form patterns in a similar way that the

285
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,870
altocumulus form patterns so sometimes

286
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:52,570
they'll be this patchwork a lot of times

287
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:56,140
they'll often also form in these rows

288
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,760
kind of like this and this so again

289
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,690
that's that undulated texture that with

290
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,110
that die I alluded to earlier so these

291
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,940
are again upper part of the atmosphere

292
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,410
so here's something rose you can see

293
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,230
they're a little bit okay so

294
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,260
cirrocumulus now this brings up an issue

295
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:17,589
which is how can you tell the difference

296
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,630
between cirrocumulus and altocumulus

297
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,510
because they're both puffy and they're

298
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,880
both kind of small and though these

299
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,540
super tiny little dots right so if you

300
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,959
saw super tiny little dots you're pretty

301
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:34,930
easily in cirrocumulus but if you have

302
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,140
bigger ones how can you tell them apart

303
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:41,170
they might kind of be the same size and

304
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,940
so one way to think about this is think

305
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,420
about it like you're a painter and

306
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:49,060
you're gonna paint these two images of

307
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,820
clouds so notice the one on the left

308
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,459
this is our altocumulus it has more

309
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,940
shading it's more 3-dimensional the

310
00:12:54,459 --> 00:13:00,370
cirrocumulus is more 2-dimensional and

311
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,700
appearance they're so high up there that

312
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,890
you can hardly see any shading now this

313
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,140
doesn't work 100% of the time especially

314
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,240
if it's sunrise sunset and you have a

315
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,970
low Sun angle a lot of times you'll get

316
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,730
shading even on cirrocumulus but if

317
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,800
you're one of my students and you're you

318
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,110
have to identify which one of these

319
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,400
clouds you have go with the shading if

320
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,470
you see shading you

321
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,270
no it's altocumulus if I give you one

322
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,800
that does not have shading and just

323
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,550
looks two-dimensional go with

324
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,370
cirrocumulus so there's a fourth puffy

325
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,200
cloud that actually does not exist at

326
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,390
just one of these three levels but in

327
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,880
fact can exist at all of those three

328
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,040
levels at the same time it starts out

329
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,230
low and it grows up high and that's

330
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,570
called the cumulonimbus now a

331
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,160
cumulonimbus also has another more

332
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,420
popular name which is thunderstorm

333
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,300
because this Nimbus means precipitation

334
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,220
so anytime you have a puffy cloud that

335
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,670
is precipitating whether it be rain or

336
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,610
snow you go with cumulant Nimbus even if

337
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,050
it's not making any audible thunder or

338
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,030
you can see any visible lightning just

339
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,190
the fact that you have precipitation out

340
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,440
of the cumuliform cloud we're going with

341
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,040
Kindle and Nimbus so here's an example

342
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,170
of what is first a cumulus cloud right

343
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,420
now but then notice right there we're

344
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,100
starting to get some precipitation and

345
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,600
in the later lecture we'll explain why

346
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,150
this is happening but for now just

347
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,430
realize that achelous can sometimes turn

348
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,590
into a cumulant cumulonimbus if the

349
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,570
conditions are right so once you see

350
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:36,010
precipitation you have to go with a

351
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,060
cumulonimbus now here's a classic

352
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,230
cumulonimbus

353
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:43,000
and you can see that at the top of this

354
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,710
you are getting kind of there's a kind

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,980
of fuzzy appearance on the top of this

356
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,380
cloud and that's called the anvil and

357
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,730
the anvil is made of ice and in fact

358
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,160
you'll notice that this part of the

359
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,850
cloud has a very sharp boundary between

360
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,250
the puffy part and in the air and this

361
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,960
part is very fuzzy this is how you can

362
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,090
tell the difference between ice and

363
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,250
liquids so you can have clouds that are

364
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,050
have little microscopic liquid droplets

365
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,630
and you can have clouds that have a

366
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,270
little microscopic particles of ice and

367
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:16,810
the difference is that the ice will look

368
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:20,800
fuzzy and the boundary of a liquid cloud

369
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,750
will be very sharp and distinct so here

370
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,050
we've got one forming over the Sandia's

371
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,330
that's the anvil and that's all ice now

372
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,730
we can't really see here whether it's

373
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,730
raining down there but if you see the

374
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,350
anvil you're pretty much guaranteed that

375
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,560
it's raining or

376
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:41,110
or perhaps even snowing so when you see

377
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,570
the anvil think cumulonimbus because

378
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:47,440
there's no other cloud that forms that

379
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,420
kind of structure so here's some anvils

380
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,339
forming in the distance so what this is

381
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,310
so far away we can't tell if there's

382
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:56,050
rain or not but when I see that that in

383
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,970
and that animal is growing there and

384
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,040
this is this one's starting to form one

385
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,620
and it will grow these cumulonimbus

386
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,800
start out without an anvil but as time

387
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,139
goes on the anvil will grow and as the

388
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,550
storm becomes more mature but if you

389
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,680
walk out in the distance and you see

390
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,240
that anvil you know they're having a

391
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,930
thunderstorm and then you know this

392
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,319
precipitation so anvils are always going

393
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,360
to be cumulonimbus in this class for

394
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:24,430
sure if you can actually see

395
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,920
precipitation you also know you've got

396
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,470
cumulonimbus so here we've got a

397
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,569
thunderstorm over the Sandia's you can

398
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,449
clearly see the beginning in the end of

399
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:36,940
where the rain is falling if you can see

400
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:39,310
definite boundaries with the rain you've

401
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,380
got cumulonimbus so in this example we

402
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,779
can't see the anvil we can't see the top

403
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,660
of the cloud you can see some flashes of

404
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,699
lightning there but normally you

405
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,029
especially like a New Mexico summer

406
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:53,440
you'll you this is kind of a typical

407
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:55,720
cumulonimbus you can see the puffy cloud

408
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,329
above you can see a shaft of rain below

409
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,310
you know you've got cumulonimbus but if

410
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:02,829
you can't see this up here and all you

411
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,140
get to see is this down here if you can

412
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:09,390
see a boundary where the rain ends

413
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:12,250
somewhere you've got cumulonimbus okay

414
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:15,760
so here's a classic example

415
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,319
cumulonimbus over albuquerque that rain

416
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
coming down even though I can't see

417
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,370
anything above here I don't know if it's

418
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,740
got an anvil or anything the fact that I

419
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:26,589
can see that the the beginning and the

420
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:30,820
end this rain column tells me it's

421
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:33,700
cumulonimbus now in the winter sometimes

422
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,700
we can get cumulonimbus and because it's

423
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,070
so cold the entire cloud is made of ice

424
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,500
crystals and you can see that it's fuzzy

425
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,450
up here but it's even fuzzy down there

426
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,450
and this is a cumulonimbus that's

427
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,510
snowing okay so if you see that it still

428
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,580
has this anvil shape

429
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,460
it's snowing all the way down to the

430
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,250
ground there's another type of puffy

431
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,830
cloud that's kind of a special case it's

432
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,460
called stratocumulus so if I have one

433
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:04,860
low puffy cloud I've got cumulus if I

434
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,530
have two low puffy clouds I always still

435
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,330
call them cumulus but if I have so many

436
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,020
puffy clouds that they end up touching

437
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,540
each other

438
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,280
or almost touching each other and maybe

439
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,750
I can see a little light in between I

440
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:21,210
don't go with stratocumulus

441
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:24,570
stratocumulus is actually the most

442
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,419
common cloud type on earth but we don't

443
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,230
see it that much on land because

444
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:33,090
stratocumulus occurs over the ocean and

445
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,820
we get it once in a while here in New

446
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,650
Mexico so here's some some strategy memo

447
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,220
so if I could just pull out one of those

448
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,049
blobs I'd have one single low cumulus

449
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,030
cloud but I have so many of them that

450
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,010
you know I can see some light in between

451
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:50,280
and maybe I'll get a glimpse of the sky

452
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:54,000
or maybe not I'm gonna call this

453
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,549
stratocumulus so classic stratocumulus

454
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,400
they look very you know they're very low

455
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:03,480
they look very heavy very bulbous on the

456
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,580
bottom usually typically worldwide you

457
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,429
don't see so much flat bottoms on the

458
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,400
strategy models like you do on on your

459
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:13,110
cumulus clouds kind of they over time

460
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,860
they just kind of have those they roll

461
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,720
and very slowly changes their shapes but

462
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,730
again you can see the breaks in between

463
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,030
can't really see the sky here so that's

464
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:26,970
strata cumulus I took this from a plane

465
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,370
looking down this is what strategy most

466
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,520
looks like from above and if you were to

467
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,730
fly over the oceans sometimes you will

468
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,890
see this for just thousands of miles and

469
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,660
in this is just like I said this is the

470
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,450
most common cloud type on earth the

471
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:45,090
stratocumulus it tends to form over the

472
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,890
oceans now it might be confused with

473
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,970
this one this is when we just saw this

474
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,320
is the altocumulus and the altocumulus

475
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,850
kind of looks like the strategy Mullis

476
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,600
but these are higher up in the

477
00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:02,130
atmosphere and the stratocumulus are low

478
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:05,190
only so keep in mind this is a mid cloud

479
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,750
whereas this is a low-cost so you can

480
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,940
see it brush in the top of the Sandia's

481
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,680
there kind of in the in the distance

482
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,870
there so that's kind of how you can tell

483
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,690
these two things apart is it if it's low

484
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,980
in there it's just solid puffy clouds

485
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,900
stratocumulus

486
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:23,790
if it's mid-level altocumulus so we've

487
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,380
gone through all the cumuliform clouds

488
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,450
and now we're going to go through the

489
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,460
stratiform clouds which are a lot less

490
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,330
interesting to look at we're going to

491
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,370
start with Stratus which is a low

492
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:38,190
stratiform cloud and the key to

493
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,800
identifying Stratus is that you cannot

494
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:44,040
tell where the Sun is so it's a gray sky

495
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,780
and in this time-lapse the Sun is

496
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,120
actually right there but you can't see

497
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,030
it so if you've got a gray sky and you

498
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:54,690
can't point to the Sun then you've got

499
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:57,240
Stratus okay so might be light gray

500
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,310
might be dark gray there might be some

501
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,100
texture in the sky there might not be

502
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,650
but what's consistent is that you can't

503
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,110
tell where the Sun is now if that gray

504
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,360
sky is also producing precipitation

505
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,520
either rain or snow we're going to call

506
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,850
it nimbostratus there's only two types

507
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,380
of clouds that produce precipitation

508
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:18,780
cumulonimbus which is the puffy one in

509
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,830
nimbostratus Stratus which is the

510
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,160
layered one and nimbostratus you know

511
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,900
grey sky as far as the eye can see

512
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,650
producing precipitation as far as the

513
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,980
eye can see

514
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:34,380
right so with cumulonimbus you could

515
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,530
tell that or the boundaries of the

516
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,450
precipitation were or at least one of

517
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,610
the boundaries with nimbostratus you

518
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,740
can't tell where the storm ends because

519
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,510
it just from your perspective looks like

520
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,180
it's going on forever in all directions

521
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:51,630
okay and again it can be rain or can be

522
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:54,960
snow that's pneumo Stratus okay now if

523
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,820
our cloud deck is thinner and we get up

524
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,080
to the middle part of the atmosphere we

525
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,080
call that altostratus

526
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,690
and because it's thinner cloud the Sun

527
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,230
will kind of poke through except it will

528
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,420
be a fuzzy ball so here is some

529
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,730
altostratus and you can see we can point

530
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,910
to where the Sun is but it's a fuzzy

531
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,170
ball right so that's your key for Altos

532
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:19,560
Stratus

533
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,990
gray sky but you can identify where the

534
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,530
Sun is in each case all right so

535
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:28,260
altostratus so when we get to the top of

536
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,030
the troposphere we have a very thin

537
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,440
layer of cloud that we call cirrostratus

538
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,940
and not only is this cloud very thin but

539
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,310
because it's so high up it's actually

540
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,410
very cold and it's entirely made of ice

541
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,570
crystals and it turns out that when

542
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:46,170
light shines through a layer of ice

543
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:49,340
crystals it makes an optical pattern it

544
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:53,220
makes a circle and cirrostratus clouds

545
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:56,100
are characterized by this ring that goes

546
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:59,160
around the Sun now the pictures I'm

547
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,510
showing you here are not mine I have a

548
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,850
really hard time getting good pictures

549
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,140
of cirrostratus clouds and some of these

550
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,060
I've been able to track down the source

551
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,440
some of these are just there all over

552
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,080
the internet and I can't figure out

553
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,500
where they originated from so I can't

554
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,350
give everybody credit but key is that in

555
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,600
a cirrostratus cloud you might see the

556
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,820
Sun as a fuzzy ball but the key is look

557
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,590
for this ring and that ring will

558
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,230
sometimes have little rainbow colors in

559
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,330
it so for this is probably the best one

560
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,700
I have we can kind of see some color in

561
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,860
there not only do you get a ring around

562
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,310
the Sun but you can get a ring around

563
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,110
the moon and this guy shows you how thin

564
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:40,260
this cloud is like you can see stars

565
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,810
through it right so it it's even harder

566
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,420
to call it a cloud but we do it's just

567
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,310
this very thin layer of ice crystals

568
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,370
away at the top of the tropopause

569
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:53,040
okay so cirrostratus you're looking for

570
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,880
the ring okay so we've gone through

571
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,850
cumuliform

572
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,460
we've gone through stratiform now we're

573
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,190
to see reform and with sea reform clouds

574
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,920
there's actually only one type there are

575
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,650
no low clouds there are no middle clouds

576
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,710
or only high cloud versions of sea

577
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:13,590
reform and so those are called Cirrus

578
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:18,360
and because they're so high up in the

579
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:20,640
sky they are entirely ice and they have

580
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,610
kind of there's a wide variety of

581
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,590
textures for cirrus clouds typically

582
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:29,190
they're very you know kind of wispy

583
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,890
hairy feathery looking so these kind of

584
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,030
look

585
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,800
cobwebs sometimes they cross each other

586
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:40,360
they look like they're kind of tangled

587
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:43,270
up like these here are some that look

588
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:48,760
more feathery and these kind of have a

589
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:50,920
net-like appearance sometimes they'll

590
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,410
get so dense that it will appear solid

591
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,559
gray and some people might try to call

592
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,260
this cirrostratus but if you're one of

593
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,240
my students if you can see the edge

594
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:05,200
something like this still go with with

595
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,850
Cirrus a lot of times they'll be hooked

596
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,080
so you see some of these have little

597
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:13,210
hooks on them and occasionally they'll

598
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,120
be just perfectly straight so here are

599
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,309
some perfectly linear cirrus clouds here

600
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,200
are some of those hooks here are some

601
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,780
that have this generating head with a

602
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,059
little tail on it okay here's something

603
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,670
that crisscross each other so there's

604
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,870
there's all kinds of shapes of cirrus

605
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,880
clouds but they're pretty easy to

606
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,190
identify they don't look like anything

607
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,080
else that we've seen here so those are

608
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,880
the ten cloud types as originally

609
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:41,170
outlined by Luke Howard back in 1802 and

610
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,420
most of the clouds you will ever see

611
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,160
will fit in one of those categories but

612
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,740
there are a few odd balls that don't

613
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,950
completely fit and I'm gonna give you

614
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:54,010
two more and these two you actually will

615
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,630
see in New Mexico occasionally so for

616
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,870
the first one here we've got the

617
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:02,020
Sandia's and there is wind that's

618
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,670
blowing up over the Sandia's and for

619
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:07,780
reasons that will explain in a later

620
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:10,360
lecture when air rises it it can form

621
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:14,790
clouds so there's this little cap of a

622
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:18,100
cloud that sits on the mountain okay now

623
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:20,530
that cap is now grown and it's starting

624
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,620
to get this shape that's kind of a

625
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:26,440
disc-shaped and we call these clouds

626
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,080
lenticular clouds or if i zoom out a

627
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,809
little bit more okay so this whole thing

628
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,059
now is this air mass moving over the

629
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:37,059
mountain is creating this this disc

630
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:39,370
called the lenticular cloud but

631
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,900
sometimes the air when it moves over the

632
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,100
mountain the cloud isn't actually

633
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,100
touching the mountain

634
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,480
so for example here we've got air moving

635
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,790
over the mountain and it's creating

636
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,500
lenticular clouds that are hovering

637
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,110
above the mountain but it's is still the

638
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,880
same process here are some more okay so

639
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,210
these are all lenticular clouds these

640
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,750
disc shapes and there's air moving over

641
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,600
the mountain here sometimes they occur

642
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,360
in stacks so these are low clouds those

643
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,780
are cumulus down there lenticular can be

644
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,540
usually there low to mid clouds these

645
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:18,330
are you know fairly low but they're

646
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:21,820
higher than the cumulus in this one and

647
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,830
often you will see chains of lenticular

648
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,900
clouds so you so sometimes they'll get

649
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,550
isolated little disks and sometimes you

650
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,960
get a whole bunch of them coming all

651
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:32,290
together and you can see in this how

652
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,790
there's air moving in and out of these

653
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,070
lenticular clouds so there's a big kind

654
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,110
of wave here in the atmosphere that's

655
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:41,050
causing this and the wave is very slowly

656
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,750
moving from left to right in this

657
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,310
time-lapse here's something similar so

658
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,860
we've got a we've got a wave in the

659
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:50,140
atmosphere and these lenticular clouds

660
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,510
are writing the top of that wave and the

661
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,930
wave is very slowly moving from left to

662
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:58,450
right so one thing that can happen with

663
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,970
lenticular clouds is let's say we've got

664
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,280
a mountain range and we've got wind

665
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,200
coming out of the in this case let's say

666
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,050
this is the Sandia's and and when we'd

667
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,930
be coming out of the west and air is

668
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:16,030
going to be forced up the mountain now

669
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:18,120
we'll learn in a later lecture that if

670
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,290
you take air and you push it up

671
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,190
eventually it will reach its dew point

672
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,630
in form of cloud and so that's going to

673
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,410
happen here and we're going to get this

674
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,910
little lenticular cloud that forms on

675
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,130
the top of the mountain

676
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,400
okay now the air goes down the other

677
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:39,940
side of the mountain but the thing is

678
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:41,890
air is compressible and it's bouncy su

679
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,650
v--'s if you compress air it kind of

680
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,960
bounces back so what happens is as the

681
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:50,190
air comes down the mountain it'll

682
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,540
actually bounce in the atmosphere and

683
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,380
you know you can't see this but there

684
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,010
will be these big waves

685
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,140
that form in the atmosphere and at the

686
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,500
top of each wave if the wave goes high

687
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:06,760
enough it will make another ticular

688
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,500
cloud so often you don't just get one

689
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:13,550
you often get it a whole chain of

690
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:15,350
meticulous so that's what's happening

691
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:18,200
here this is Mount Shasta there's a

692
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,510
lenticular hat kind of on the top and we

693
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,910
also see some lenticular clouds nearby

694
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,800
and that's they're all related that

695
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,930
we're making waves in the atmosphere

696
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:31,190
from that mountain interacting with the

697
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:33,380
wind so here a whole chain and one took

698
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,600
your clouds again I've gotten images

699
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,310
here that I can't track down in terms of

700
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,260
the original source but they're very

701
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,430
popular on the Internet so that's what

702
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,960
you're going to see here on some of

703
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:44,540
these but here's a whole chain of them

704
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,420
so the atmosphere is again kind of

705
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,790
bouncing and as it bounces it makes

706
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,190
lenticular clouds at the top of each of

707
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:54,980
those waves sometimes it will occur in

708
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,230
stacks okay that's that can happen in

709
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,970
fact here's a image from National

710
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,670
Geographic this is I believe is Mount

711
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,480
Rainier and these are you know big stack

712
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:08,540
and lenticular clouds on top here's one

713
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,560
I took over campus you don't have to

714
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,730
have a mountain to get lenticular clouds

715
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,950
conditions are right you can get one

716
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,870
tubular clouds just about anywhere but

717
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,650
they the mountains definitely help their

718
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:24,100
formation would it surprise you if I

719
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:27,860
told you that every year there are a

720
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,500
alarming number of 911 made because

721
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:34,010
people we are reporting UFOs when they

722
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:36,980
see clouds like this maybe that doesn't

723
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:39,290
shock you but you know that's kind of

724
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,210
convincing right or how about that one I

725
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,270
mean that's the mothership showing up

726
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:47,360
for sure so some of them really do look

727
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:48,950
like UFOs and here's another one from

728
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,230
National Geographic and they took this

729
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:55,430
picture right before the zebra got

730
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:57,020
abducted here okay so that's when

731
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:01,310
ticular clouds that's an extra one

732
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:03,020
another extra one here's a cumulonimbus

733
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:06,560
so that remember that's the thunderstorm

734
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,800
and sometimes what we'll get right on

735
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,470
the bottom of a

736
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,200
nimbus are these sinking blobs a

737
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,330
cold-air that come down and they form

738
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,120
kind of a droopy looking cloud that's

739
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,760
called the mattes and these will often

740
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,400
happen right before or right after a

741
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,950
thunderstorm occurs so here they are

742
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,690
each one of those blobs is sinking cold

743
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,930
air that's coming down out of this

744
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:34,020
cumulonimbus here's some more that are

745
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:38,100
these are better lit here so you can see

746
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,990
them starting to come down we got a

747
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,490
little precipitation over here but for

748
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,620
the most part that's those are just

749
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,770
blobs of cold air here's some good ones

750
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:49,830
forming right there okay so these are

751
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,420
Alma mattes these blobs coming down so

752
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,610
again sometimes you'll see this right

753
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,440
before a thunderstorm or sometimes

754
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,740
you'll see it right after a thunderstorm

755
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,590
so we do see these in New Mexico in the

756
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,270
summer now here's a there's a

757
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,830
thunderstorm in the distance and this is

758
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,050
the anvil that's kind of drifting over

759
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,240
us and sometimes they'll form in the

760
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,510
anvil itself so you can see some little

761
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,720
blogs in there and sometimes you'll see

762
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:19,410
really spectacular photos of madness in

763
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,860
New Mexico the best time to see mammatus

764
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:24,690
is late in the afternoon and when the

765
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,300
Sun angle is low they'll show up better

766
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,970
kind of like this one or this one these

767
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,900
are momentous forming in an anvil so

768
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:36,270
this whole thing up here is the anvil

769
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:39,510
and another one again near sunset and it

770
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:42,260
really exaggerated s-- the the Matis

771
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,400
makes it easier to see a lot of times

772
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,770
the madness that we get here in New

773
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,600
Mexico or not nearly as good as these

774
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,850
pictures I'm showing so this is probably

775
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,460
the best Momentis that I've taken a

776
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,470
picture of here in Albuquerque but this

777
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,960
is kind of more tick typical so this is

778
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:01,440
on campus and you can see that there's

779
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,360
blobs in there right but it doesn't look

780
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,520
nearly as well-defined as some of those

781
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,740
other pictures okay so in conclusion we

782
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,960
got 10 cloud types that were originally

783
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,330
defined by Luke Howard back in 1802 and

784
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,700
on top of that I'm giving you two others

785
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,260
that don't fit very well in that

786
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,710
original classification system

787
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,260
lenticular and

788
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,059
madness okay so in the next lecture

789
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,039
we're going to start getting into

790
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:30,789
humidity and we're going to work up to

791
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:33,360
how these clouds actually form thanks

792
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,360
for watching

793
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,340
you
