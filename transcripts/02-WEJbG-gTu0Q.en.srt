[Music]

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,980
hey how you doing this is Mel strong and

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,130
this lecture is an introduction to

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,120
humidity now before we get into humidity

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,850
we're going to talk about the

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,910
composition of Earth's atmosphere so

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,970
this visual here represents the gases

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,970
that make up Earth's atmosphere and it

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,170
doesn't matter where you are the

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,359
composition of the Earth's atmosphere is

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,510
pretty much the same no matter where you

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,620
go so the atmosphere is about 78%

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,010
nitrogen in about 21% oxygen and about

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,879
1% argon and right there

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,410
you're about 99.9% of all the gases in

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,450
the atmosphere there's a little bit of

17
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,390
co2 in a little tiny amount of

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,430
everything else so before we go on let's

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,379
talk a little bit about these gases

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,960
because it's worth knowing a few things

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:03,300
about them so with nitrogen what this

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,479
what this visual is is saying is that

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,490
right now you've got more nitrogen going

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,640
in and out of your lungs than any other

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,210
gas so my question is what is it doing

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,159
for you and an answer is absolutely

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:20,820
nothing because nitrogen is what we call

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,920
an inert gas what that means is that it

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,320
really doesn't react with anything and

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,530
in order to get nitrogen to react with

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,840
something you've got to have really

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,000
really high temperatures before any kind

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,030
of reactions occur so as it goes in and

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,070
out of your lungs you basically your

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,220
body just ignores it now it turns out

36
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,200
your body needs nitrogen but it can't

37
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,630
get it this way and that'll come up

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,240
later in future lectures so oxygen is

39
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,670
that an inert gas oh no this is very

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,119
reactive right and this is why we need

41
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:03,000
it because it what we call oxidizes and

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,270
so we need that for our respiration

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,729
process the oxygen accepts electrons and

44
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,290
gets converted in our body from oxygen

45
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,010
to carbon dioxide argon is another inert

46
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,870
gas

47
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:21,660
and also very heavy so in other words

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,240
it's a very dense gas maybe this is one

49
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,910
you haven't heard of before but if you

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,880
have seen thermal windows like double

51
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,010
pane windows that are built to insulate

52
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,500
in between the gas they usually put

53
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,110
argon and the reason for that is because

54
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,150
the gas molecules are so heavy they're

55
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,550
really slow and they bump into each

56
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,270
other very slowly and that's how heat is

57
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,610
transferred so they argon gas makes

58
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,000
pretty good insulation then we've got

59
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,370
carbon dioxide and we're gonna talk all

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,720
about carbon dioxide much later in the

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,300
semester but this is a greenhouse gas so

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,650
those gases right there make up

63
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,690
I guess at 99.9% of all of the gases in

64
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,100
the atmosphere so here's another way to

65
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,600
look at that we could break this down

66
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:15,090
and again you can see that there's

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,850
nitrogen at seventy-eight percent oxygen

68
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:22,560
about 21% argon a point nine percent add

69
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,970
those three together you got 99.9% fact

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,210
that's ninety nine point nine five

71
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,430
percent or so and then all these little

72
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:31,290
traces of gases and some of these you've

73
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,610
heard of maybe some you have it all add

74
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,740
up together so there's a little bit of

75
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,380
other things in the atmosphere however

76
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,770
of all the gases that are shown here

77
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,670
there's one gas that you are breathing

78
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,830
right now

79
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,070
that's in the atmosphere right now and

80
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,880
it's not on this list and that gas is

81
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:53,880
water water has never shown in a graph

82
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,600
like this or in a list of atmospheric

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,450
gases and the reason is water vapor is

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,990
considered a variable gas so that means

85
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,240
that it could range from close to zero

86
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,160
all the way up to maybe four percent in

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,380
certain parts of the world if you're in

88
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,920
New Mexico it usually ranges from about

89
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,250
zero to maybe close to one percent of

90
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,580
all the gases in the atmosphere so the

91
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,230
reason it's not shown in the graphs that

92
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,750
we've been looking at or the tables you

93
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,050
might find is because all those numbers

94
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,540
have to add up to

95
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,840
and so if I go back to the previous

96
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,330
graph I was just looking at here so all

97
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,030
these numbers add up to exactly 100 so

98
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,470
if I had 2 percent water those numbers

99
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,360
wouldn't add up to a hundred I have to

100
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,280
adjust them all or if I had one percent

101
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,650
water then they wouldn't add up to 100

102
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,210
again and I have to adjust them all so

103
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,640
what they do in all text books and all

104
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,120
references with atmospheric gases as

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,740
they call this the dry composition so

106
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,900
dry gas composition of the atmosphere

107
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,520
this is what all the gases of the

108
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,250
composite of the atmosphere would look

109
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,870
like if there were no water but there is

110
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,850
water so you got to take that into

111
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,220
account so that's why they never list

112
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,990
water on these on these tables because

113
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,480
it's always different from day to day

114
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,940
and depends on where you live so

115
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,220
humidity is a way that we describe how

116
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,320
much water vapor is in the atmosphere

117
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,090
and there's several ways to do it

118
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,160
in this lecture we're going to learn two

119
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,780
different ways to describe humidity in

120
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,780
the next lecture we're going to learn

121
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,850
2/3 now the way that would probably make

122
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,890
the most sense to you right now is to

123
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,870
talk about the percentage of gases in

124
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,130
the atmosphere that's water so we just

125
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,980
talked about this how you could have

126
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,560
zero to four percent of the gases in the

127
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,990
atmosphere be water vapor turns out

128
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,270
though that's actually not the way we

129
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,500
usually do it the first method that

130
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,930
we're really going to get into is

131
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,940
something called mixing ratio and mixing

132
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,570
ratio describes how many grams of water

133
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:55,450
vapor there are in every kilogram of air

134
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,140
and it's often written as a fraction so

135
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:02,380
here we have mixing ratio equals grams

136
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,860
of water vapor on as a numerator and

137
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,170
kilograms of air as a denominator now

138
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,470
the conventional way to do this is to

139
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:14,680
think about a single kilogram of air so

140
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:17,290
I box up some air enough that I have one

141
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,500
kilogram and I want to know in that box

142
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,200
how many grams of water vapor do I have

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,720
so that's kind of the way we're going to

144
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,990
think about this so you might see mixing

145
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,020
ratio written something like this mixing

146
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,880
ratio is three grams per kilogram or

147
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,979
three grams per kilogram and the

148
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,190
Assumption here is that you know that

149
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:42,460
grams means grams of water vapor

150
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:45,820
kilogramme means kilograms of air okay

151
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,740
now the thing is before we get any

152
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,350
further I want to make sure that we can

153
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,360
visualize what this means what does it

154
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,190
actually like what does a gram of water

155
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,480
vapor look like and what does a kilogram

156
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:01,390
of air actually look like okay so we're

157
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,810
gonna talk a little bit first about the

158
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:09,490
metric system so in the metric system

159
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,240
when they were inventing it they said if

160
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:16,180
you have a cube and the cube is exactly

161
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,700
one centimeter on each side one

162
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,350
centimeter on each side okay one

163
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,610
centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1

164
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:27,520
centimeter the volume of that is one

165
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:30,880
cubic centimeter okay and it turns out

166
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:36,790
if I fill this cube with water that I

167
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:40,900
will have a mass of exactly one gram so

168
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,790
one gram of water would look like AK you

169
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,520
could fill up a cube that's one

170
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,470
centimeter on each side so what is a

171
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,990
physical object that you can think of

172
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,730
that's about this big so there's a

173
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,750
couple of them I can think of one would

174
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:59,440
be like a sugar cube what I usually show

175
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:03,370
everybody or dice so a standard die is

176
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,040
about one centimeter on each side so one

177
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,600
gram of water would look like what

178
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,700
machen if these were little ice cubes

179
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,840
right each one of these would be about

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,720
one gram of water so when we talk about

181
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,950
say back to this three grams

182
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,380
the mixing ratios three grams per

183
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:24,610
kilogram that three grams means three

184
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:26,050
grams of water vapor think about okay

185
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,510
I'm gonna take water vapor that's in the

186
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:32,260
air I'm going to condense it down to a

187
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,930
blob and that blob in this case I would

188
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,690
have three of these guys I could fill up

189
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,210
three of these little cubes with water

190
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:45,250
that way that's what three grams of

191
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:47,200
water looks like all right so before we

192
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,390
move on to the kilogram of air let's

193
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,870
just talk a little bit more about the

194
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,180
metric system because also when

195
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,790
they came up with a system one cubics in

196
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:06,490
the centimeter has another name it's

197
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:11,350
called the milliliter our ml and the end

198
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:14,520
if you have a thousand milliliters that

199
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,930
equals one liter

200
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,870
okay so that's going to come up here in

201
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,550
a little bit okay so back to our initial

202
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,010
problem I wanted you to be able to

203
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,040
visualize what does this mean this three

204
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:33,640
grams per kilogram what does that mean

205
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:36,670
and the top so we've said the top is

206
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:41,740
three with all ice cubes each the size

207
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:50,200
of a of a die the bottom I want you to

208
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:52,510
visualize a box and the box has one

209
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,750
kilogram of air in it and the question

210
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,700
is how big would that box be because we

211
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,670
don't think about air as having much

212
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,529
mass like we we don't even think about

213
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:06,310
the weight of the air above us but it

214
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:08,440
has some and so it turns out at our

215
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,890
altitude so here in Albuquerque were

216
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,420
about a mile mile above sea level it

217
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:18,010
turns out that if you had a box it's

218
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:21,250
about a meter by meter by a meter that

219
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,930
would be about one kilogram of air okay

220
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,490
see so you fill this up

221
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,980
one meter by one meter by one meter

222
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,610
that's one cubic meter so how big is a

223
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,800
meter think about a doorknob you reach

224
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:36,190
out to grab a doorknob and the doorknob

225
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,010
is about one meter above the ground okay

226
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,890
so that's a meter so imagine a box that

227
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:45,490
big on each side that's a kilogram of

228
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:48,970
air okay so now imagine this box is now

229
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,140
made of plexiglass and so it's plastic

230
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,630
you can see through it and there's a

231
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,920
little door in it okay and we have

232
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:59,260
filled our box with perfectly dry air

233
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,130
but I'm going to open up the little door

234
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:06,310
and I'm going to throw in three little

235
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,850
ice cubes okay so I got three grams of

236
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,220
water

237
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,170
I got one kilogram of air I'm gonna open

238
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,480
up the door I'm gonna throw my three

239
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,970
grams of ice in there and close the door

240
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,560
and so my little ice cubes fall to the

241
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,930
bottom of the box and let's say the box

242
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,850
is perfectly sealed and then they melt

243
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,230
so I got for you all the puddles right I

244
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,970
got through though the puddles sitting

245
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:30,250
here at the bottom of water and then

246
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,440
they evaporate so I come back later and

247
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,560
the these three little puddles have

248
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,530
completely evaporated so the air that's

249
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,860
in there has a mixing ratio of three

250
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:43,600
grams per kilogram we just made it right

251
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,790
we took a kilogram of air we took three

252
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,070
grams of water we stuck it in there we

253
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,630
let it melt and evaporate and it's

254
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,630
floating around in there and water

255
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,280
molecules by the way the oxygen is

256
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,470
pretty big compared to the hydrogen's

257
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,870
and the hydrogens stick on one side of

258
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,970
it so they look like these Mickey Mouse

259
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,580
heads so you have to kind of imagine

260
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,620
you've got this box now with these

261
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,030
Mickey Mouse heads floating around in

262
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,010
there these all the water molecules

263
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:14,110
right we'll see more of this in a little

264
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:16,180
bit okay so imagine I open up the little

265
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,550
door now and let's say I've got a little

266
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,800
cup like a little coffee cup and I reach

267
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,160
in there and a scoop out and I pull out

268
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,980
some of that air what's the mixing ratio

269
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:33,460
of the air inside my cup it turns out

270
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:36,010
ratios stay the same they're independent

271
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,870
of size okay so if I take a little bit

272
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,430
of that air the mixing ratio of the

273
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,600
little bit of air that I got out of that

274
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:46,680
box is still three grams per kilogram

275
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,390
okay so you've got to separate out the

276
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,410
ratios from the absolute amounts of

277
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,150
water so with mixing ratio there's a

278
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,430
number of problems that we can do with

279
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,220
this and I'm gonna work out a couple of

280
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:03,450
examples here so here's one it says

281
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:07,270
mixing ratio is four grams per kilogram

282
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:11,890
how much water do we have total in five

283
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:13,870
kilograms of air okay so if I show this

284
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,640
problem the people generally half the

285
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,920
people I show this to think that they

286
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,930
should multiply these two numbers and

287
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,710
the other half think they should divide

288
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,649
these two numbers

289
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:27,399
and neither one can usually give me a

290
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:30,040
very good reason why so the problems

291
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,560
like this I want you to visualize go

292
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,430
back to thinking about a kilogram of air

293
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,959
as a box a box of air right so I've got

294
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:44,730
one kilogram of air is a box that we

295
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:50,589
said was a meter on each side all right

296
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:52,870
okay so if I one box and the mixing

297
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,850
ratio is four grams per kilogram I have

298
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:59,050
four grams

299
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:03,240
inside that box right now if I have five

300
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:07,060
kilograms I essentially have five boxes

301
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,690
so think about okay so that's one box

302
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,149
but then I got another one right and

303
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,970
then I got another one and so on and so

304
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:19,410
forth each one of these has four grams

305
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:23,020
in it so if I've got five of them total

306
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,260
then I can multiply it should make sense

307
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:29,589
to you that can multiply four times five

308
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,709
for the total amount of water so I'll

309
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:34,779
write this out with just the unit's here

310
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:38,709
so I would take my mixing ratio for

311
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:40,690
grams per kilogram multiply that by the

312
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:45,510
number of kilograms I have in this case

313
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:48,070
I have five I'll put that over one and

314
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,100
if I do it if I write it out this way

315
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:54,940
that unit kilogram cancels that unit

316
00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:00,160
kilogram four times five is 20 and grams

317
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:02,170
are the units that I have left so by

318
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,240
writing out this way I can see which you

319
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,670
know what I hope is that the unit's that

320
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,680
I don't want to cancel leaving mean the

321
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,100
unit's that I do want that's an

322
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,740
indication that I probably did it right

323
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,690
so I'll do another one

324
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,120
so when this one says the mixing ratio

325
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,860
is 12 grams per kilogram so that might

326
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,890
be a value that we would have here in

327
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,839
the summer during our monsoon season how

328
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,430
much water is in this room okay so let's

329
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,140
just imagine we're in a room and here's

330
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:33,370
the dimensions of the room five meters

331
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,920
by three meters by 12 meters so what I

332
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:39,120
need to know to answer this is how many

333
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,640
kilograms of air do I have and I know

334
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,310
that at our altitude here at Albuquerque

335
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,950
one kilogram of air is about one cubic

336
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,740
meter so in order to answer this I need

337
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,390
to know how many cubic meters I have

338
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,279
therefore that will tell me how many

339
00:15:52,390 --> 00:16:00,400
kilograms I have okay so this is a

340
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,440
volume problem and volume is length

341
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,600
times width times height so I'm gonna

342
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,980
take five meters times three meters

343
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:13,060
times 12 meters and I do that

344
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:19,680
calculation five times three times 12

345
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:24,730
I get a hundred and 80 cubic meters okay

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,459
so that tells me because one cubic meter

347
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:31,990
of air is one kilogram that I have a

348
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:35,560
hundred and eighty kilograms of air in

349
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,540
that room so now it's just like the last

350
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,290
problem I have a hundred and eighty

351
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,660
boxes of air each box has 12 grams of

352
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:52,120
water vapor in it so to get the total

353
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:56,440
water I take my mixing ratio and

354
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,900
multiply it by the number of kilograms

355
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,630
of air that I have so again it's like

356
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,439
180 boxes of air each box has 12 grams

357
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:07,419
in it write it up this way you should

358
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,000
see that units you don't want go away

359
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:15,100
and they in the unit's you do want are

360
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:19,089
left so I end up with 12 times 80 I'm

361
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:23,130
sorry 12 times 180 and that gives me two

362
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:26,559
thousand one hundred and sixty grams

363
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:29,050
okay so I want I want you to be able to

364
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,000
visualize what this means okay so this

365
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,010
is the total amount of water so if we

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,500
condensed all the water out of the room

367
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,630
right though all the water molecules in

368
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,550
this room we condense it out we would

369
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,400
have two thousand one hundred and sixty

370
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:45,120
grams well just a minute ago I told you

371
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,559
that so a gram

372
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,480
of water equals one milliliter or one

373
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,010
cubic centimeter right so that's the

374
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,059
same thing as saying two thousand one

375
00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:00,120
hundred and sixty milliliters of water

376
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,500
that's the same thing and can you

377
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,809
visualize what that is

378
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,169
well a thousand milliliters are in a

379
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:09,840
wieder so two thousand milliliters is

380
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:14,570
two liters so if I divide this by a

381
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:18,450
thousand I get two point one six liters

382
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:20,669
so think of a two liter bottle right we

383
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,649
have filled up a two liter bottle and

384
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,419
we've got a little bit left over that's

385
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:26,070
how much water we would have if we were

386
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:30,450
to condense all the water out of this

387
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:33,090
room on this particular day so let's go

388
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:37,409
back to this idea of a big plastic box

389
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,360
that we put little ice cubes in and at

390
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,850
the time what I said was we had a little

391
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,590
door on it we could put little these

392
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,929
little ice cubes in there they would

393
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,059
melt then they would evaporate and we'd

394
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:50,940
have air with some certain kind of

395
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:53,549
mixing ratio let's imagine we go back to

396
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,669
this box and opened the door and I put

397
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:59,850
in three more ice cubes and to close it

398
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:02,039
and they melt and they evaporate and

399
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,200
then I go back and open the door and I

400
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,880
put three more ice cubes and they melt

401
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,399
and they evaporate I could keep going

402
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,279
back and I could keep putting ice cubes

403
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:16,169
into the door but there comes a point

404
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:18,690
where if I put too many in there they'll

405
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:22,049
follow the bottom they'll melt but they

406
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:24,630
will no longer evaporate because air has

407
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:27,720
a limit as to how much water vapor can

408
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,399
exist in it in any given time and so we

409
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,679
have a term for this it's called

410
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:38,190
saturation so what that means if we talk

411
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,460
about the air is reached saturation or

412
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:47,279
maybe we might say the air is saturated

413
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:58,649
what that means is that the air can no

414
00:19:47,279 --> 00:20:00,480
longer hold any more water vapor so this

415
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:02,610
is critical because what this means is

416
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,700
that there's a limit is a limit as to

417
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:09,870
how much water can be in the air at any

418
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,159
given time now on learn or again if

419
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,090
you're coming here from somewhere else

420
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:17,909
on my website there is a graph that I

421
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:21,000
want you now to look at so go ahead and

422
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:23,159
download that and we're gonna look at

423
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,440
this graph together it's a it's a table

424
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:32,580
of numbers with a curve looks like this

425
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:34,740
so this table on the left so the very

426
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,320
left-hand column says air temperature

427
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,570
and fahrenheit in this column here says

428
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,929
maximum possible mixing ratio at this

429
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:46,350
temperature so what it's showing is that

430
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:48,539
if it let's say it's 70 degrees and

431
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:53,039
we've got our plastic box idea right

432
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:56,159
it's 70 degrees in one kilogram of air

433
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,080
the absolute most water vapor that you

434
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:03,390
could evaporate into one kilogram of

435
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,730
bear is 19 point 12 grams so this is 19

436
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,909
point 12 grams per kilogram so in one

437
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,549
box of air one kilogram box the this is

438
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:14,130
the limit as to how much water that air

439
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:17,280
could hold and you'll notice that as I

440
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:22,139
increase the temperature the numbers get

441
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:26,580
higher lower temperatures numbers get

442
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:28,139
lower and in fact this graph is what you

443
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,940
would get if you were to graph these

444
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:32,330
numbers it would look like this we got

445
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:37,320
temperature on the x-axis we've gotten

446
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:40,559
maximum mixing ratio on the y-axis so

447
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,169
what this is telling us this is actually

448
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,200
one of the most fundamental laws in

449
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:49,320
weather this idea that temperature

450
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,950
controls how much water could be in the

451
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,929
air at any given time what this is

452
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:59,580
saying is that if you increase the

453
00:21:54,929 --> 00:22:02,789
temperature you the air could have more

454
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,480
and more water vapor in it it doesn't

455
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:08,400
mean it has to have that

456
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:15,190
this is a maximum possible mixing ratio

457
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:19,419
so let's say it's 80 degrees right so 80

458
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:22,750
degrees the maximum I could have is 27

459
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,980
grams per kilogram could I have less

460
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,590
than that yes

461
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,720
how much less could I have zero sure I

462
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,809
could have zero but I can't have more

463
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,870
that's what this means notice as you go

464
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:37,210
down into colder and colder temperatures

465
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,830
the numbers get smaller and smaller or

466
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,470
we get down into this graph let's say

467
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:46,090
it's zero degrees Fahrenheit here zero

468
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:49,630
right so at zero the maximum I could

469
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:53,590
have is about a little over one gram per

470
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:56,110
kilogram so even if the air saturated

471
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,900
even if it's completely maxed out the

472
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:03,040
most I could have is a little bit more

473
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:05,650
than one gram per kilogram so this is

474
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:11,559
critical because what this means is that

475
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:13,750
cold air is always dry air even if it's

476
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:18,540
saturated even if it's completely maxed

477
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:21,820
out it's still dry I look down here

478
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,320
temperature is a minus 20 minus 40 right

479
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,720
or on this table

480
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,590
you've got really tiny mixing ratios

481
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,590
that are possible so one of the rules

482
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:35,710
and weather and climate is we're going

483
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:39,360
to get into is cold air always dry air

484
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:45,280
always no there's no way around that

485
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:47,559
however hot air could be humid it could

486
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,260
have high mixing ratios but it doesn't

487
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:53,620
have to all right so it could be very

488
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,870
low or it could be very high but cold

489
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:00,700
air absolutely has to be dry air no

490
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:02,679
matter what all right so we can see the

491
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,380
effects that temperature has on humidity

492
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,799
if we look at the earth as a whole so

493
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:11,350
I've gone to the site earth null

494
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:13,530
Schoolnet and this is a visualization

495
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,520
tool that shows us the current weather

496
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,070
all over

497
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,860
and I'm gonna click the word earth and

498
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:24,309
I'm gonna pick an overlay it says tpw

499
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,929
that's for total precipitable water and

500
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:28,510
what this is going to show us is it's

501
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:30,490
going to show us that the how much water

502
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:34,570
is in the atmosphere mm-hmm and there's

503
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:37,210
no numbers here but to the left on the

504
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:41,410
scale the brown that's very very dry air

505
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:43,540
and then as you get more humidity more

506
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,370
water vapor it turns more blue than

507
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,010
light blue and then kind of this white

508
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:52,300
color I'm gonna click the word earth to

509
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:54,490
make that disappear and so I can rotate

510
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,100
the earth around and look at where most

511
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,500
of the water vapor is on the planet and

512
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:03,910
what I see is that there's this big band

513
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:08,320
of really high humidity air that that's

514
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:11,559
typically found around the equator so as

515
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,660
you probably know it's usually pretty

516
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:18,040
hot at the equator and it's sitting over

517
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:20,380
this open body of warm water and because

518
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:24,970
of that the mixing ratios there are

519
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:27,550
usually very high on the other hand if I

520
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:32,320
turn this around say we could look at

521
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:35,710
Arctica and and Arctica is very dry

522
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,270
because it is very cold right and so

523
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,420
both of the poles of the earth are

524
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,520
pretty cold but Antarctica is even more

525
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,740
cold because not only is that the South

526
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,410
Pole the South Pole is about a mile

527
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,660
above sea level so it's much colder than

528
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:53,080
North Pole and we see it's very Brown

529
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,870
very dry air here but we can also see

530
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,320
some other effects like if I go to let's

531
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:02,830
go over here to South America and you'll

532
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,770
see that there's this brown blob right

533
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:08,800
here so I'll zoom in a little bit there

534
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:11,830
so this is all the amazon basin here so

535
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,920
think about tropical rainforest right so

536
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:18,580
pretty humid here but what's this why is

537
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,860
this so dry right here so that's a very

538
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,820
tall mountain chain called the Andes and

539
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,919
so high elevation is usually colder

540
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,540
temperatures colder temperatures mean

541
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,820
drier air so we've got

542
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:35,000
well the really dry air here next to

543
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,560
pretty humid air and we can see this in

544
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,930
several other places in the world and

545
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,820
again if you do this yourself you'll see

546
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,470
slightly different patterns than I'm

547
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,600
seen depending on what time of year

548
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,550
you're looking it's winter in the

549
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,590
northern hemisphere right now so we see

550
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:53,030
a lot of dry air over the continents the

551
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,000
cold air that's coming down from near

552
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:58,790
the North Pole so look at someone closer

553
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,680
to home here yeah we're all still pretty

554
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:05,240
dry here so overall if you just kind of

555
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,210
look at the earth as a whole you will

556
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,970
see that we've got a band of pretty

557
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:16,790
humid air around the equator and pretty

558
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:18,350
dry on the north and south poles okay

559
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,240
we're going to do a little thought

560
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,450
experiment here so let's go back to this

561
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,610
idea of having a box of air I got one

562
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:29,480
kilogram of air and there's water

563
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:31,610
molecules floating around inside the air

564
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,100
in this box and I happen to know that

565
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,400
the mixing ratio is nine point two four

566
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,710
grams per kilogram okay I also happen to

567
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:43,340
know that the temperature of the air in

568
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:45,710
this box is 70 degrees so one question I

569
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,220
could ask could I add more water

570
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:52,820
molecules to the air inside the box so

571
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,950
if I go to this table and I look at 70

572
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,850
degrees it says the maximum possible

573
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:03,290
mixing ratio at 17 degrees is 19 point

574
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:05,930
12 I'm only at nine point two four so I

575
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:08,810
could definitely add more water to the

576
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,520
air inside this box okay but we're going

577
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,770
to do something different actually we're

578
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,070
gonna cool it down so let's imagine that

579
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:21,820
I start to cool this box down so it's at

580
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:27,370
70 and I start to cool down to 65 to 60

581
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:31,790
to 55 and notice what happens on our

582
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:35,450
list of numbers here as I go down from

583
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:38,690
72 65 to 60 to 55 the maximum possible

584
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:42,350
mixing ratio is also going down right so

585
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:45,440
if I get down to 50

586
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:48,260
while 50 the maximum possible mixing

587
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,100
ratio is nine point two four grams per

588
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:55,190
kilogram which is exactly what I have so

589
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:59,630
if I cool this down from 70 to 50 when I

590
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:02,030
get to 50 at that point the air is

591
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:06,950
saturated it can't hold any more water

592
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:09,260
vapor okay now let's say I cool it

593
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:13,940
further so I'm gonna cool it all the way

594
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:16,400
down to 45 let's say well the maximum

595
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,610
possible mixing wish' at forty five is

596
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,429
seven point six four grams per kilogram

597
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:25,400
but I'm at nine point two four so as I

598
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:28,190
cool it down to forty five I've got to

599
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,700
lose about two and a half or so grams of

600
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:34,010
water so as soon as I get down to 50 in

601
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:39,440
the air becomes saturated as I COO it

602
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:43,309
further water molecules have to come out

603
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,669
of the vapor state out of the air and

604
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:48,260
they will collect on the bottom or the

605
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:52,309
size of this box

606
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:55,940
so whether nature requires that all my

607
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:58,039
little water molecules the extras have

608
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,809
to come out and they will start to

609
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:07,880
collect in these clusters on the inside

610
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:11,120
of the box and the transition from the

611
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:19,210
vapor state to these clusters of liquid

612
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:23,360
we call that condensation right okay so

613
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,220
condensation occurs at 50 degrees and as

614
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,520
we cool it further and further and

615
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,919
further we will continue to pull water

616
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:36,020
out of the air as required by the

617
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:37,549
numbers that are in this table so let me

618
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,049
show this to you a slightly different

619
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:45,380
way and imagine here I've got just an

620
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:47,059
image of water molecules here floating

621
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:52,520
around we don't know how many there are

622
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:55,370
and it's 80 degrees outside right so I

623
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,910
start to cool it say Sun Goes Down this

624
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,690
is air

625
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:02,150
outside Sun Goes Down starts to cool and

626
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:05,060
cools and it cools and it cools and if

627
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:07,910
it cools enough eventually we're gonna

628
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:11,780
reach the saturation point and when we

629
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:14,380
do when we reach that saturation point

630
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:19,910
and then we continue to COO it further

631
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:22,130
we would start making condensation so

632
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:25,310
right here we've got the 65 degrees

633
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:27,800
we're making condensation this is not

634
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:31,400
rain this is water that's coming out as

635
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,770
drops on the surface and at that point

636
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,370
they are saturated and what we have just

637
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:40,190
made is something called do right so

638
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,600
these droplets and I have to show

639
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,490
pictures of this to people that live in

640
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,830
New Mexico because our air is so dry

641
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:49,370
that this only happens a few times a

642
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:52,670
year but when it does happen the dew

643
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,980
droplets typically form on the grass and

644
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:59,140
the reason is because the grass is very

645
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:02,240
thin and thin things cool off first so

646
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,700
these are do droplets that form one that

647
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,490
when the air was cooled down to the

648
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:11,480
point that saturation occurs and cooled

649
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:15,020
even further below that so if we go back

650
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:18,380
to this idea this temperature at which

651
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:27,760
this happened in our box this has a name

652
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:27,760
this is called the dew point temperature

653
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:41,780
or sometimes because we're lazy we just

654
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:44,240
call it the dew point so you've actually

655
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,790
done this experiment yourself you've

656
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,890
taken at some point probably leftovers

657
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,720
leftover food you put it in the

658
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,180
Tupperware you put the Tupperware in the

659
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,000
refrigerator and you come back the next

660
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,410
day and you pull it out and when you

661
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,020
take the lid off you'll notice there's a

662
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,600
bunch of little drops on the inside of

663
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,910
the lid that weren't there when you put

664
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,440
the food in the refrigerator so what

665
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,030
happened there is you

666
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,940
when you put it into the refrigerator

667
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:14,070
the air that was in that container had a

668
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,560
higher mixing ratio than it was allowed

669
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:21,300
by the temperature of the refrigerator

670
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,700
so you actually may do in that box in

671
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:32,220
the refrigerator now if we go back to

672
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:35,970
this case this example here here because

673
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,730
our we notice the condensation occurred

674
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:42,060
at 65 degrees on this particular night

675
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:44,190
we could conclude from that that the dew

676
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,680
point temperature was 65 that's when we

677
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,810
still saw condensation first start to

678
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:52,260
form now let's say I do this another

679
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:54,540
night and I've got less water vapor to

680
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,670
start with right so there's less water

681
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,100
molecules in the air than there was in

682
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,890
this first example it's 80 degrees again

683
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,500
and I cool it down and I cool it down

684
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,810
and I cool it down the last time we hit

685
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,390
the dew point here but we've got less

686
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:12,000
water now so that means I can cool it

687
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:15,060
further before I actually reach

688
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,980
saturation so in this case I cool it all

689
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,590
the way down the 50 degrees until I

690
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:23,340
finally see that the water molecules

691
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:26,340
start to condensate out as do so from

692
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,800
here what we could can conclude is that

693
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:34,640
the dew point is 50 degrees because

694
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:37,440
that's when condensation occurs so

695
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:41,730
mixing ratio is one way that humidity is

696
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,530
reported the other way is dew point so

697
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,620
in a weather report they'll often give

698
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:50,370
the dew point as a way to represent the

699
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:52,740
humidity in the way that works low dew

700
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,660
point means there's less water vapor in

701
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,330
the air which means the air is pretty

702
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,790
dry high dew point means there's more

703
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:04,910
water vapor in the air which means that

704
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:07,320
air has is more generally more humid so

705
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,810
the other way to think about dew point

706
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,430
is that it describes the temperature at

707
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:14,100
which the atmosphere becomes saturated

708
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,930
so if I tell you let's say tonight I say

709
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,200
we check the weather and the weather

710
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,340
report says the dew point is 45 degrees

711
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,210
one of the bits of information that

712
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,240
tells us

713
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:26,580
is that if we cool it down the 45

714
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,270
tonight we will get do right we'll we'll

715
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:33,060
get saturation so here's an example of

716
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:37,140
how we might use dewpoint so this is a

717
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:40,020
map and this map has temperatures of dew

718
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,580
points in degrees Fahrenheit and you can

719
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,349
see that over here in the southeast

720
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,230
they've got dew points that are in the

721
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,970
60s and 70s over here in our neck of the

722
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,359
woods we have dew points that are in the

723
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:54,839
20s so that tells you there's a lot more

724
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:58,050
water vapor in the air over here then

725
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:01,500
there is where we live another way to

726
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:06,510
think about this so if you lived say in

727
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:08,640
Florida if it got down to the 60s at

728
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,520
night you would get do right because the

729
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,310
dew point here is like 65 here it's 70

730
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,760
if you lived over here you'd have to

731
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:20,310
have temperatures down below 25 if

732
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,720
you're in the red zone or below 20 if

733
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:26,790
you're in the yellow zone by the way

734
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,740
what happens when you get dew points

735
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,320
below freezing

736
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,260
if the dew point is below 32 degrees

737
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,940
Fahrenheit or zero degrees centigrade

738
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,880
then that means that in order to get do

739
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,470
you've got to get it below freezing but

740
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,020
you're not going to get liquid what

741
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,570
you'll get is frost and frost looks the

742
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,430
same it's little sparkles on the grass

743
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,710
at night that's when the dew point is

744
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,390
below freezing and you manage to cool it

745
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,640
below freezing but it's the same idea

746
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,099
and in the winter this is a lot more

747
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,619
common you may have scraped ice off your

748
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,080
windshield that's what's happening

749
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,970
it's you've reached saturation but the

750
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,990
saturation point was below freezing and

751
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:12,240
your windshield is thin you know cools

752
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:14,910
off first another way that we actually

753
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,859
use dew point a lot in New Mexico is to

754
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:19,560
monitor the monsoon and we'll talk about

755
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:21,150
the monsoon in later lectures but this

756
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,430
is something called the dew point

757
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,280
tracker and so if you look at this on

758
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:31,500
the x-axis these are dates there's June

759
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:33,630
first and then there's July 1st and the

760
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,230
ignore everything except the blue line

761
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,839
for

762
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:39,599
the blue line is the dew point as

763
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:43,800
recorded at the airport here in

764
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:46,440
Albuquerque so when the blue numbers are

765
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,599
higher you have more water vapor in the

766
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,300
air you have higher dew points then

767
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,280
you'll see them drop that's low dew

768
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,500
points dew dew points are over here on

769
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,970
the on the y axis so here we got dew

770
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,470
points of like maybe five degrees

771
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,740
Fahrenheit they don't have units but

772
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:04,200
these are units of Fahrenheit so we had

773
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,839
really dry air right through here then

774
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,849
it got more humid then they got a little

775
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,560
bit drier then they got more humid again

776
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:14,070
and goes back and forth back and forth

777
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,830
but notice that once we get into July we

778
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,990
have pretty high dew points for almost

779
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,089
the entire summer

780
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:24,960
now this graph stops in August 22nd

781
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:27,390
which is when they made this one look

782
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,080
for a minute at the red curve the red

783
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:33,359
curve is what you get if you were to

784
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,330
average out all of the monsoons that

785
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,589
have happened in the past 30 years and

786
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:42,720
if you do so on average in Albuquerque

787
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:46,680
what happens is the dew point starts to

788
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,080
rise in the spring and once it rises

789
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:54,210
past this Green Line this Green Line is

790
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:56,790
47 degrees it rises past this this Green

791
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,890
Line for three consecutive days we

792
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:02,250
declare that the monsoon has officially

793
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,589
started and then on average again we're

794
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:07,560
looking at the red one on average the

795
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:09,660
red line stays above this green line and

796
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,390
it starts to dip back below the Green

797
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:16,080
Line in the middle of September and then

798
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,119
we go into the fall so dew point is one

799
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,760
of the things that we use to monitor the

800
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:24,119
monsoon activity when we have high dew

801
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,250
points that's usually coincides with

802
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,230
what we call monsoon bursts we have a

803
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,480
lot of there's a lot of humidity in the

804
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,520
air a lot of water in the air and so

805
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,920
that's more conducive to precipitation

806
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,619
formation so when you see these spikes

807
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,770
here those are times when we probably

808
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:43,920
had more thunderstorms and more chances

809
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:45,750
of precipitation or sometimes we go into

810
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,760
what are called monsoon breaks and

811
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,430
that's what this is

812
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,130
so this dip here is a period where we

813
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:56,250
were in a very dry spell ative ly dry

814
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:58,680
air for the monsoon period and during

815
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,650
that time we probably saw very few of

816
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,200
any cumulonimbus very few thunderstorms

817
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,869
during that time so dew point is pretty

818
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:13,140
important here in New Mexico especially

819
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:16,230
during the monsoon season so dew point

820
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,109
is reported at pretty much all weather

821
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:22,109
stations report dew point it changes

822
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:24,210
throughout the year so in New Mexico

823
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:27,869
it's typically higher in the summer and

824
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:30,109
lower in the winter and one of the other

825
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:33,150
things that can change dew point

826
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:38,010
especially where we live is the wind

827
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:41,190
direction so we happen to live between

828
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:44,490
you know New Mexico's here and we've got

829
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,710
a pretty warm body of water down here

830
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,720
and we have a pretty cold body of water

831
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,770
over here right so let's say we've got

832
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,510
wind coming from the northwest where did

833
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,070
that wind come from well it came from

834
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,560
somewhere to the north where was

835
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:02,820
probably cold and cold air is always dry

836
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,740
air dry air low dew point so we have

837
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,560
wind's coming out of the West or the

838
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:12,000
north of the Northwest usually that

839
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,950
coincides with times of low dew point on

840
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,020
the other hand if the wind comes out of

841
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,660
the east or the southeast that's coming

842
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,330
from a location that was pretty warm big

843
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,540
warm body of water that's usually

844
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:27,540
conducive to high amounts of water vapor

845
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,310
in the air so usually for us if we have

846
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,220
wind that comes out of the East or the

847
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:34,590
southeast we usually get higher dew

848
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,770
points because we have more water in the

849
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,770
air

850
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:45,150
you
