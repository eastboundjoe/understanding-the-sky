00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:10,690
[Music]

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,329
hey this is Mel strong and welcome to my

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,459
lecture on humidity part 2 if you

4
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:17,619
haven't watched part 1 I suggest you go

5
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,689
and do that first then this one will

6
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:23,109
probably make a lot more sense

7
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,699
so to recap from last time we talked

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:26,949
about two methods that we use to

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:30,550
describe humidity one was mixing ratio

10
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:32,320
and the other was dewpoint now mixing

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,379
ratio is probably the one that's the

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,899
easiest to visualize and it's describing

13
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:40,930
how many grams of water vapor are in

14
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,120
each kilogram of air so it has units of

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,219
grams per kilogram

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,379
dew point it's a little more abstract

17
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:50,020
but it describes at what temperature the

18
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,600
air would become saturated so if I say

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,789
the dew point is 40 degrees one of the

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,800
things that that tells you is that if I

21
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:00,969
cool it down the four degrees tonight I

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:05,439
will get condensation or do so both of

23
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:06,909
these are used to describe humidity and

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,439
what we're going to do is we're going to

25
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,750
talk a little bit about how we might be

26
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:16,509
able to change those two variables so

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,400
let's imagine I add water to the air

28
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,740
somehow so you can imagine maybe I'm

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,630
boiling a pot of water and water is

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,659
evaporating out of my pot going into the

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,729
air then how is that affecting the dew

32
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:31,119
point in the mixing ratio of the air so

33
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:34,329
if I can add water to the air any by any

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,560
means both the mixing ratio and the dew

35
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:41,259
point will increase now the converse is

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,649
also true if I remove water from the air

37
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:48,850
both mixing ratio and dew point will

38
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:51,880
both decrease now key idea here you

39
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,210
cannot change one without changing the

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,180
other

41
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,130
so think about mixing ratio if I add

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,229
water to the atmosphere I can think of

43
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,140
it like I'm adding grams of water to the

44
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,820
atmosphere mixing ratio must go up but

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,009
if I add more water to the atmosphere

46
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,440
that means I don't have to cool it as

47
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:12,040
much before it becomes saturated so the

48
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,740
dew point also goes up so if one goes up

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,110
the other must go up if one goes down

50
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,990
the other must go down it's impossible

51
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,720
to change dewpoint or mixing ratio eat

52
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,390
either way up or down without changing

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,240
the other one in the same way so keep

54
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,490
that in mind now we also talked a little

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,090
bit about how you might change dew point

56
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,030
last time and same goes for mixing ratio

57
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,700
which is often the a change in wind

58
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:44,830
direction will result in a change in dew

59
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:47,320
point or mixing ratio so for New Mexico

60
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,870
where we live if we get a twin coming

61
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,060
say from the north or the Northwest that

62
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,540
wind has come from somewhere cold and

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,300
cold air is always dry air so generally

64
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,730
that equates to low dew points low

65
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,280
mixing ratios if we get wind coming from

66
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,680
the south east that usually comes from a

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,420
location that's pretty warm and has

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,240
pretty high dew points and high mixing

69
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,850
ratios so those values will go up now

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,680
this is also true pretty much no matter

71
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,450
where you live in the United States if

72
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,190
you're getting a north wind that wind

73
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,530
probably came from somewhere up in

74
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,120
Canada where it was cold and dry if you

75
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,980
hear the wind coming from the south it

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,380
probably came from somewhere more humid

77
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,210
in your mixing ratios and dew points

78
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:33,040
will increase as a result so what what

79
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,550
I'm going to do is show some practice

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,200
problems here and these are all problems

81
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,700
that are kind of revolved around this

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,500
concept so we'll go through the

83
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,590
questions and we'll go over the answers

84
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,390
here so here's the first one says the

85
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,000
mixing ratio in this room today is 3

86
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,720
grams per kilogram okay the temperature

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,910
in here is 70 degrees Fahrenheit so I go

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,850
and I just turn up the thermostat in a

89
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,460
room and then warm up the room to 80

90
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,680
how has the mixing ratio changed so

91
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,050
here's a choices mixing ratio increased

92
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,170
decreased didn't change or not enough

93
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,240
information to answer okay so so all

94
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,580
we've done is we've warmed up the room

95
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,370
okay so when you have a question like

96
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,040
this you ask yourself okay did I add

97
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,940
water to the air or did I subtract water

98
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,310
from the air

99
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,770
now all I've done is raise the

100
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,930
temperature so I did not add any water

101
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,600
to the air I did not subtract any water

102
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,960
from the air so the mixing ratio

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,640
is still three grams per kilogram now

104
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,130
the reason I'm giving you this question

105
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,040
is because in the past some students get

106
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,770
confused once we learned how temperature

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,990
changes maximum mixing ratio they tend

108
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,390
to one that try to change the mixing

109
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,770
ratio itself with temperature so in

110
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,270
other words a lot of people on this

111
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,190
question would say oh it's warmer

112
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,280
it's a warmer temperature therefore the

113
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,680
mixing ratio went up no not unless we

114
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,920
added water okay so in this case the

115
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,110
mixing ratio has not changed okay let's

116
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,000
look at another one pot of water boiling

117
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,110
on the kitchen stove the windows and

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,600
doors are all closed so we are air in

119
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,270
our house is sealed how is the dewpoint

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,740
inside the kitchen changing increasing

121
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,630
decreasing not changing not enough

122
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,500
information to answer okay so if I'm

123
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:23,860
boiling water on the stove then clearly

124
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,840
I am adding water molecules up into the

125
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,880
air as the water is boiling or assuming

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,850
the pot is open water molecules are

127
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,150
coming out and going into the air in the

128
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,580
in the kitchen so if we're adding water

129
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,100
to the air in the kitchen that's going

130
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:44,620
to increase dewpoints and this one the

131
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,130
dew point would be increasing so another

132
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,260
one tonight

133
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,980
dew starts to form on the grass outside

134
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,980
as it does so how is the dew point

135
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,660
changing overnight increasing decreasing

136
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,220
doesn't change not enough information

137
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:03,070
okay so if do is forming that means we

138
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,900
are we have condensation if we have

139
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,400
condensation that means that we're

140
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,080
taking water molecules and we're

141
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,850
bringing them down and we're putting

142
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,880
them onto the grass onto the ground

143
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,620
somewhere and that is removing water

144
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,860
from the air we have to remove water

145
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,220
from the air to make do okay so if we're

146
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,400
making do we're removing water from the

147
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,170
air and that is decreasing the dew point

148
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,560
okay so we're going to decrease the dew

149
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:32,310
point as we remove water from the air to

150
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,310
make the dew

151
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,190
which of the following locations most

152
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,220
likely has the highest annual average

153
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:45,660
dew point and so if you're unfamiliar

154
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,800
with these places you can kind of look

155
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,750
at them on a map but we're last time if

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,210
you remember we looked on the internet

157
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,220
at Earth Knoll Schoolnet and we looked

158
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,130
at where most of the water vapor in the

159
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,200
world is and it's along a band kind of

160
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,630
near the equator so if you live

161
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,490
somewhere we're surrounded by warm ocean

162
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,040
and you have warm temperatures you're

163
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,770
gonna have pretty high dew points so of

164
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,590
these choices Miami is probably your

165
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:18,840
best bet for having highest average dew

166
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:23,370
point okay dew point in this room was 50

167
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,310
for temperature is 75 I turned the

168
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:30,810
thermostat up so the room warms to 80

169
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,660
how has a dew point changed okay so once

170
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,210
again you ask yourself did I add water

171
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,030
to the air J subtract water from the air

172
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,360
or did I not add or subtract any water

173
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:45,390
from the air so all I did here is so we

174
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:50,610
know the dew points 54 temperatures 75

175
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:52,860
so if I increase the temperature have I

176
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,440
added water to the air no if I

177
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,790
subtracted water from the air no dew

178
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:05,100
point still 54 okay so dew point has not

179
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:07,170
changed okay similar to one that always

180
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,900
seemed just a minute ago a pot of what a

181
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,640
water is boiling on the kitchen stove

182
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,990
windows and doors are all closed how is

183
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,890
the mixing ratio inside the kitchen

184
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,740
changing

185
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:19,500
so again if you're boiling water on the

186
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,690
stove that water is coming out of the

187
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,180
pot going into the air we're literally

188
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:30,660
adding grams of water to the air so that

189
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:32,100
mixing ratio is increasing wind has been

190
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,200
blowing from the west for several days

191
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,640
suddenly shifts directions and starts

192
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,380
blowing from the east how's the dew

193
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,620
point likely change so we just kind of

194
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,900
talked about this so if it's coming from

195
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,790
the West it's coming from off the

196
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,890
Pacific Ocean the Pacific Ocean is very

197
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,250
cold and the dew points are usually

198
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,900
going to be

199
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,610
very low over here coming from the east

200
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,530
if we trace that ear back somewhere it

201
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,380
probably came over maybe the Atlantic or

202
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,150
maybe the Gulf of Mexico and the dew

203
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:07,800
points were pretty high so most likely

204
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:09,930
the dew point has increased ok dew point

205
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,350
in this room is fifty four temperature

206
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:17,520
is 75 I turned the thermostat down so

207
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:21,030
the room cools to 40 does the air become

208
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:25,280
saturated in other words another way of

209
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:28,440
asking this is do we make do in our room

210
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,650
so in order to answer that I need to

211
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,500
know the dew point 54 okay then I need

212
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:37,260
to know are we cooling it down to or

213
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,120
below the dew point yes

214
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,330
we're cooling it down to 40 that's below

215
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:48,480
54 so we are going to make do we are

216
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:50,910
going to saturate the air so yes same

217
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,980
question except I added one more

218
00:09:50,910 --> 00:10:00,330
sentence does the dew point change okay

219
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:04,680
so to illustrate what happens here let's

220
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:06,990
consider I got two thermometers one

221
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,640
measures temperature one measures

222
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:13,500
dewpoint let's say okay so right now the

223
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,520
temperature is above dew point and let's

224
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,050
say I cool down the room all right or

225
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,880
maybe this is happening outside doesn't

226
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:25,530
matter so I cool it down 10 degrees

227
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,430
temperatures drop 10 degrees dew point

228
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,380
has not changed

229
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,290
why is dew point not changed we haven't

230
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,050
taken any water or added any water from

231
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,360
the atmosphere cool it down further now

232
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,000
it's 60 dew point still hasn't changed

233
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,110
same amount of water in the air now we

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,900
drop it down to 50 and at 50 degrees air

235
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,770
is saturated okay so from this point

236
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:52,140
forward we're gonna start making do so

237
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,600
right at 50 where the temperature equals

238
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,420
the dew point right at this point right

239
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,000
here both of those values are the same

240
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,030
the air is saturated and what we would

241
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,950
get at this

242
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,100
instant in time would be like

243
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,810
microscopic do tiny tiny little

244
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,010
particles you could hardly see but as a

245
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:13,090
COO it further below 50 those little Dew

246
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:17,050
droplets we're gonna start to grow

247
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,810
larger and larger now as I start to grow

248
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,540
do larger and larger I have to take

249
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,480
water molecules out of the air and put

250
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,280
them down onto the ground like the grass

251
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,790
or if this is happening inside to beyond

252
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,640
the walls so here we are 50 I'm going to

253
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,550
cool it further down to 40 and notice

254
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:40,120
what happens dew point has to change

255
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,850
with temperature so if the temperature

256
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,790
drops to 40 the dew point also has to

257
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,090
drop to 40 and if I drop it further to

258
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:52,530
30 the dew point still has to follow the

259
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,420
temperature and also go down to 30

260
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:59,110
one of the laws to keep in mind in your

261
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,510
head dew point can never be higher in

262
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,250
temperature ok dew point can never be

263
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,040
higher than temperature so here they're

264
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,590
the same you can have temperature higher

265
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:18,450
than dew point but you can't have dew

266
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:18,450
point higher than temperature ok ok

267
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,730
monsoon season in New Mexico and we

268
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,220
notice that over several days the dew

269
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,760
point is decreasing right so let's

270
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,690
imagine worth it's in August and we

271
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,390
notice that the dew point has been

272
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,940
decreasing for several days how will

273
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,400
this most likely affect our weather

274
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,520
so if dew point goes down that means

275
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,560
there was less water molecules in the

276
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,570
air if there's less water molecules in

277
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,450
the air you're gonna have a harder time

278
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,620
making precipitation right so if you

279
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,620
want to make a cumulonimbus a

280
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,720
thunderstorm you need to have water

281
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,690
vapor available for that to happen

282
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,910
so when dew point goes down the chance

283
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,390
of precipitation goes down with it

284
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:10,810
usually so most likely we would have a

285
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:13,780
lower chance of precipitation ok story

286
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,769
problem dew point is 52 today does not

287
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,860
change for the

288
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:20,470
next 24 hours it's sunrise a temperature

289
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,679
of 68 by noon the temperature is 85 by 4

290
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,509
the temperature is 94 when do we have

291
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,600
the highest concentration of water

292
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:31,689
molecules in the air is that sunrise is

293
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,730
it at noon is it at 4:00 the amount of

294
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:36,459
water in the air doesn't change not

295
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:40,480
enough information to determine so what

296
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:41,980
do you think about that one so the key

297
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,790
to this question is in the first

298
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,389
sentence it says the dew point is 52 and

299
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:52,329
does not change for the next 24 hours so

300
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:54,850
the only way I can change dew point is

301
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:57,519
to add water to the air or subtract

302
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,339
water from the air the fact that the dew

303
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,319
point is not changing it tells me does

304
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,389
not change for 24 hours so the amount of

305
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:08,079
water in the air is not going to change

306
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:10,720
for 24 hours so d the amount of water in

307
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,059
the air does not change so you have to

308
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,480
in your mind keep separate temperature

309
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:18,399
from dew point temperature can

310
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,769
effectuate up and down every day dew

311
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,360
point often remains constant all day

312
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:28,990
long for day after day after day

313
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:31,749
sometimes so today we're introducing a

314
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,629
third way to describe humidity which is

315
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:36,459
relative humidity turns out relative

316
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,529
humidity is the most common way that

317
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,839
humidity is described to the general

318
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:44,199
public but it's also completely

319
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,069
misunderstood by almost everybody we're

320
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,379
going to talk about why it's so

321
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:49,509
confusing in a minute but you've

322
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,129
probably heard relative humidity before

323
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:53,259
in a weather report they might say

324
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:56,139
something like the relative humidity is

325
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:59,110
35% okay so before we explain what that

326
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:02,259
means let's make a point to explain what

327
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:07,540
it does not mean it does not mean that

328
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:09,429
the air is 35% water vapor because in

329
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,939
the last lecture one of the things we

330
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:15,910
talked about is that water vapor ranges

331
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:18,160
somewhere between zero and almost 4% of

332
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,679
the total of gases in the atmosphere so

333
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,759
there's no way that it could be 35% of

334
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:27,910
total gases so it does not mean that we

335
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:30,940
can define relative humidity

336
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,490
as this fraction where we're looking at

337
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,370
the current mixing ratio that's on the

338
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,070
top divided by the maximum possible

339
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:42,130
mixing ratio at the current temperature

340
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,470
on the in the denominator now for this

341
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,900
class generally speaking you're going to

342
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,790
be given the the top you're going to be

343
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,610
given what the current mixing ratio is

344
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,470
and the bottom number we're going to

345
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,560
have to look up from the table that we

346
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,200
had last time so then we take that

347
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,570
fraction and we multiply it by hundred

348
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,120
to turn it into a percent so relative

349
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:08,080
humidity is given as a percent between

350
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:11,320
zero and 100 percent so what does this

351
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,580
tell you well the percentage tells you

352
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,860
how close you are to saturation so 100%

353
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,710
relative humidity means the air is

354
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,800
saturated meaning it can't hold any more

355
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:27,850
water vapor okay so we're gonna do a

356
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:31,170
sample problem and here's an example of

357
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:35,140
the type of problem that we would see so

358
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,960
mixing ratio is 4 grams per kilogram the

359
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,120
temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit

360
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,480
what is the relative humidity so the

361
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,010
first thing I do is I write out the

362
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,930
definition of relative humidity it's a

363
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,150
current mixing ratio divided by the

364
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,310
maximum possible possible mixing ratio

365
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:58,150
at the current temperature times a

366
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:59,830
hundred okay so what do we know so the

367
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,560
current mixing ratio is given to us

368
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:07,390
that's 4 grams per kilogram so put that

369
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,310
in on the top now the maximum possible

370
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,960
mixing ratio at the current temperature

371
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,280
the temperature is 80 degrees I've got

372
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,230
to go back to the graph that we used

373
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,990
last time

374
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,750
here is 80 degrees the maximum possible

375
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,670
mixing ratio 20 7.01

376
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,830
grams per kilogram so I'm going to put

377
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:33,010
that in 20 7.01 Bram's per kilogram

378
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:35,550
times 100 all right so I'm going to do

379
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,550
that calculation

380
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:50,150
4/20 7.01 times 100 and I get 14.8% okay

381
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:53,410
so that's my relative humidity all right

382
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:56,510
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

383
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,180
change the problem by just changing one

384
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:02,210
little thing which is let's go back to

385
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:05,030
the original problem and let's say that

386
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,910
it's 80 degrees in the afternoon when

387
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:11,600
all this happens and then the Sun Goes

388
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:14,270
Down and becomes cooler and it cools off

389
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,570
overnight and it cools down to 50

390
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,990
degrees and everything else stays the

391
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,730
same the mixing ratio is still the same

392
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:27,200
so let's make a new calculation of

393
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:31,300
relative humidity all right so back to

394
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,590
this what do we know well we know that

395
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,330
the top of the fraction is still the

396
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:40,700
same but now the bottom of the fraction

397
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,590
has a different number because we're at

398
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,810
the different temperature so I go back

399
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:50,450
to the table 50 degrees the maximum

400
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:54,890
possible mixing ratio is 9.2 4 grams per

401
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:59,720
kilogram so I'm gonna put that in 9.2 4

402
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:08,060
grams per kilogram times 100 ok so now

403
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:13,670
we will do that math so I've got 4/9

404
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:21,710
point 2 4 times 100 is forty three point

405
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:25,340
three percent okay so here is the point

406
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:27,950
and this is a really important one where

407
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,100
I'm gonna say this more than once the

408
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:34,730
relative humidity was about 15 percent

409
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:38,180
and then it jumps up to 43 so more than

410
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,070
doubles right so if I went to the

411
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:43,060
average person on the street and I told

412
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:45,470
them that this morning or this afternoon

413
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,110
the relative humidity was about 15

414
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,090
percent and then tonight it went up it

415
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,910
more than doubled most people would

416
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,720
think that we must have more water in

417
00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:00,750
the air because relative humidity went

418
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,280
up if the relative humidity doubled most

419
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,870
people would think oh we must have

420
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,890
double the amount of water in the air

421
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:09,690
because that's what humanity describes

422
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:13,110
except that's not what happened because

423
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:15,660
the mixing ratio is the same for both of

424
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,490
these the mixing ratio tells us how much

425
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,620
water is in the air there's four grams

426
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,460
for every box you know every one

427
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,680
kilogram box of air so the relative

428
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,170
humidity went up not because there's

429
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,530
more water in the air but just because

430
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,480
it's a cold air temperature this is why

431
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,120
relative humidity is so confusing to

432
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,790
people the general public thinks that

433
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,070
when relative humidity goes up the air

434
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,650
got more humid there's more water in the

435
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,780
air but in fact that's not what happened

436
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,480
at all the amount of water in this case

437
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:51,000
stayed exactly the same what happened

438
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,950
was we went to a colder temperature and

439
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,290
the colder temperature meant we were

440
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:58,020
dividing by a smaller number which gave

441
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,320
us a bigger answer so what this really

442
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:04,920
tells us is that initially we were

443
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,960
pretty far from saturation about 15% we

444
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,080
got closer to the saturation we're still

445
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,330
a long ways away but that's all this

446
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,630
really tells us is that the air became

447
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,910
closer to saturation but the amount of

448
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,550
water in this case stayed exactly the

449
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:24,650
same in both instances and that is why

450
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,650
relative humidity is so confusing

451
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,280
so with relative humidity a lot of times

452
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,290
we're not so much interested in the

453
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,510
actual numbers as much as we want to

454
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:37,410
know if relative humidity is going to

455
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:39,660
increase decrease or stay the same so if

456
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,010
you've got one of those problems first

457
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,140
thing to do is write out the definition

458
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,790
of relative humidity which we said is

459
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,280
the current mixing ratio divided by the

460
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,810
maximum possible mixing ratio at the

461
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,670
current temperature now these problems

462
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,350
that we're going to see we're gonna

463
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,000
we're trying to figure out how relative

464
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,680
humidity is gonna change so we're going

465
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,420
to change the temperature we're gonna

466
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,030
change the mixing ratio so even though

467
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,190
keep in mind that even though I use the

468
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,120
word current in here we're projecting

469
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,040
into the future of some

470
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:11,560
that's gonna happen so it won't be

471
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:13,960
current so what you would do is with a

472
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,180
given problem is write this out and

473
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,390
think okay is that is the mixing ratio

474
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,390
gonna increase decrease or stay the same

475
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,210
and then is the maximum possible mixing

476
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,940
ratio on the increase decrease or stay

477
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,470
the same once you figure that out you

478
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,020
can figure out whether the overall

479
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,750
answer the relative humidity itself is

480
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,520
going to increase decrease or stay the

481
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,200
same but you don't actually have to do

482
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,780
any math you're just trying to reason

483
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,200
out which way it's gonna go so I do a

484
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,120
couple of examples here so the mixing

485
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,370
ratio today stays constant throughout

486
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,880
the day how does the relative humidity

487
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,020
this afternoon compared to this morning

488
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,260
so we're going on the assumption here

489
00:22:53,020 --> 00:23:00,370
that this afternoon is warmer than this

490
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,500
morning normal day okay so then we write

491
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,570
out the definition of relative humidity

492
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,440
and think about okay is the numerator

493
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,020
gonna change

494
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,840
is it denominator going to change so

495
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,940
let's start with the top is the mixing

496
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,070
ratio going to change here it says

497
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,690
mixing ratio today stays constant so the

498
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,820
top of this fraction is going to stay

499
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,360
constant throughout the day because

500
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,500
we're told that the bottom though

501
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,210
maximum possible mixing ratio at the

502
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,330
current temperature the temperature

503
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,910
itself is going to change and so we from

504
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,190
the chart we know that if we increase

505
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,710
the temperatures throughout the day the

506
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:39,030
maximum possible mixing ratios are also

507
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:42,340
going to increase so that tells us that

508
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:46,330
the bottom of this fraction is going to

509
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,830
increase as the day gets warmer so that

510
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,630
means we're taking a number even though

511
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,160
we don't know what the number is and

512
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,040
we're dividing it by another number

513
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,770
that's getting bigger if you divide by a

514
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,520
bigger number you get a smaller answer

515
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:02,170
so from this then we can predict that

516
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,960
the relative humidity is going to

517
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,760
decrease as the day gets warmer we're

518
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,940
dividing by a bigger and bigger number

519
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,580
as the day goes on so do another one

520
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,220
here you put a sealed box of air into

521
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,560
the refrigerator as it cools how does

522
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,750
the relative humidity change so

523
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,700
by sealed box we can assume that there's

524
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,260
no water that goes in or out of the box

525
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,390
there's some amount of water vapor in

526
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,280
the box we don't know how much so we

527
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,530
don't know the current mixing ratio but

528
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,750
the way the problem set up it's not

529
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,030
going to change

530
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,710
well the bottom of this change yes we

531
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,420
are assuming that we've got air that is

532
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,190
probably room temperature we're putting

533
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,160
it in the refrigerator it's going to

534
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:45,520
start cooling and so again from the

535
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,950
table as we cool down the temperatures

536
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,280
we're going to have smaller and smaller

537
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:53,260
maximum possible mixing ratios so in

538
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,200
this case the bottom part of this

539
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,910
fraction is becoming smaller so now

540
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,070
you're taking a number you don't know

541
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,080
the number but whatever it is you're

542
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:05,140
dividing it by a smaller and smaller

543
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,150
number as it gets colder and colder so

544
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,620
what happens to the answer it gets

545
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,290
bigger if you divide by a smaller number

546
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,560
you get a bigger answer so the relative

547
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:19,120
humidity increases as this box gets

548
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,670
colder let's do another example

549
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,670
so sprinklers come on in our yard in

550
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,350
they stay on for 30 minutes and says

551
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,380
during this time the temperature outside

552
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:34,120
does not change how does the relative

553
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:36,340
humidity change so could we change the

554
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,170
top part of this fraction well for

555
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,380
sending streams of water through the air

556
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,120
and tiny droplets there's a very good

557
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,740
chance that a lot of that water at least

558
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,290
a portion of it is going to evaporate

559
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,690
and we're going to add water molecules

560
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,310
to the atmosphere right that's not what

561
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,200
a sprinkler is trying to do sprinklers

562
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,720
trying to sprinkle the grass but it goes

563
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,180
through the air and you're guaranteed to

564
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,280
have some evaporation so if we have

565
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,710
evaporation we're going to increase

566
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,780
think of it as increasing the grams of

567
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,180
water in the air we're increasing the

568
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,120
top part of this fraction what about the

569
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,220
bottom well the bottom depends on the

570
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,280
temperature but the temperature says is

571
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,900
not changing right so the bottom part of

572
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,320
this fraction stays the same

573
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:23,980
so the top part gets larger the bottom

574
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,760
part stays the same so overall my answer

575
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,960
is going to increase so relative

576
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,440
humidity increases as we

577
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:36,169
water to the hair okay here's another

578
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,020
example it's a little different so on

579
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:41,990
Monday the relative humidity is 25% on

580
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,840
Tuesday the relative humidity is 45% on

581
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,919
which day was there more water vapor in

582
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,899
the air

583
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,840
okay so what's clear from this question

584
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:53,899
is that the relative humidity increases

585
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,510
right so let's think about why that

586
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:59,600
might have happened could we increase

587
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:03,559
the relative humidity by increasing the

588
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,500
numerator of this fraction so yes if we

589
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,360
increase the mixing ratio then that

590
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,169
would make the relative humidity go up

591
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,029
so that could be a possibility but we

592
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:18,169
could also make that number bigger if

593
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:21,320
we're dividing by a smaller number so if

594
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:23,600
I decrease this number and how would I

595
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,380
decrease this number I could decrease

596
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,140
this number if I made it colder so one

597
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,870
possibility is I could have made the top

598
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,620
number larger another possibility is I

599
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,929
could make the bottom number smaller

600
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,950
either way could have get could get me

601
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:45,830
from 25% to 45% the problem is without

602
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,510
enough information I actually don't know

603
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,960
which of those two things happen or

604
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:53,630
maybe it's a little bit of both so this

605
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,320
is the problem with relative humidity if

606
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,880
I told you the dew point increases you

607
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,490
know the amount of water in the

608
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,620
atmosphere had to increase have I tell

609
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,690
you the mixing ratio increases you know

610
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,120
the amount of water and the atmosphere

611
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:11,149
had to increase if I tell you the

612
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,730
relative humidity increases without more

613
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:16,039
information you don't know if I added

614
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:19,000
more water to the air or if I just made

615
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:22,340
it colder or a little bit of both so

616
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,480
relative humidity is ambiguous and a lot

617
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,700
of times when we're dealing with

618
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,669
relative humidity we just don't have

619
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:33,500
enough information to answer questions

620
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:36,649
like this so few more facts about

621
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,899
relative humidity a few things to keep

622
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:42,679
in mind when temperature equals dew

623
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:43,820
point your air is saturated and your

624
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,220
relative humidity

625
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,670
is a hundred percent okay so remember

626
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,390
that one inside a cloud relative

627
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,060
humidity

628
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,060
always a hundred percent or fog fog is a

629
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:58,210
cloud on the ground you can't have

630
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,220
relative humidity over a hundred percent

631
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,720
okay at least not in this class so if

632
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,970
you're doing the math and you come up

633
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,970
come up with a number over a hundred he

634
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:10,940
did something wrong all right the

635
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:13,300
relative humidity usually cycles over 24

636
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,970
hours whereas dewpoint mixing ratio

637
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:21,530
usually do not okay so let me explain

638
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:24,040
that one a little bit more so if we

639
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:27,290
measure temperature every hour

640
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,690
throughout a 24 hour cycle day after day

641
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:31,280
after day we would notice that the

642
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,310
temperature is cycle right

643
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,290
it gets warms up during the day the

644
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:40,160
hottest time is usually late afternoon

645
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:42,530
then it cools down and then the coldest

646
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,560
time in the 24 hour period is usually

647
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,720
right before the Sun rises and then the

648
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:52,250
cycle continues again right we have this

649
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:55,160
call sign wave curve of temperature well

650
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,470
what we said now several times is that

651
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,270
relative humidity depends on the

652
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:02,060
temperature that's on the bottom of that

653
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:05,000
fraction that we keep talking about so

654
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,790
what that means is where the temperature

655
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,760
is the warmest we would expect the

656
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:12,590
relative humidity to be the lowest and

657
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,480
where the temperature is the lowest we

658
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:17,690
would expect relative humidity to be the

659
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,850
highest so this is the kind of graph

660
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:24,410
that you expect to see with relative

661
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:26,690
humidity in a normal 24 hour day the dew

662
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,450
point in the mixing ratio don't change

663
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,610
very much in fact usually especially

664
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,220
here in New Mexico day after day after

665
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:38,060
day you typically have a pretty constant

666
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:40,430
dew point usually okay but the relative

667
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,890
humidity is always in a 24-hour cycle

668
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:45,530
because the temperature is in a 24-hour

669
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,810
cycle so we typically see the lowest

670
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:50,690
relative humidities the hottest part of

671
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:52,310
the day then they rise at night so we

672
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,860
see the highest relative humidities at

673
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,710
night and then the cycle repeats again

674
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,720
so again I keep repeating myself

675
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,179
but it's really important to emphasize a

676
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,250
lot of people are super confused about

677
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:06,649
relative humidity if they have a little

678
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,059
weather station they look at it and it's

679
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:11,210
night and they see the relative humidity

680
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:13,460
go up they think oh there's there's more

681
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,260
humid there's more water in the air but

682
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,029
no that's not what's happening the only

683
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,370
thing that's happening is a temperature

684
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,350
as increase temperature has decreased in

685
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:26,600
the night time which makes the relative

686
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:28,789
humidity increase so with all this

687
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,470
confusion then good question would be

688
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:34,309
why in the world that were using

689
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:36,380
relative humidity at all in fact when I

690
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,419
started this I said that we use relative

691
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,149
humidity more than the other two

692
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:43,340
variables so one of the reasons is that

693
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,130
it's related to human comfort or

694
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:49,700
discomfort so you've probably

695
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:52,010
experienced these at some point if you

696
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,679
have a hot day with high relative

697
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,419
humidity you feel miserable and we'll

698
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,600
talk more about this in the next lecture

699
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:01,669
but a lot of it has to do with the

700
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,950
evaporation or the lack thereof of your

701
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:10,279
sweat in fact there are something called

702
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:15,559
the heat index sometimes referred to as

703
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:17,990
a misery index and on the y-axis here we

704
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,789
have relative humidity so there are 0%

705
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,000
to a hundred percent this is the

706
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:26,090
temperature from 70 to 110 and these

707
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,299
boxes are what it feels like to you

708
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,890
that's the heat index so you'll notice

709
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:33,429
that for example if you have low

710
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,720
relative humidity it actually will feel

711
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:37,970
cooler than it really is

712
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,850
right so if it's a hundred degrees

713
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:45,320
outside but the relative you made it is

714
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:49,279
0% then it feels like it's about 91 okay

715
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,049
so that's nice but of course what's not

716
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,500
nice is when you get too high relative

717
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:57,409
humidity right so if you have a 100

718
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,080
degree day and 80 percent relative

719
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:02,419
humidity you end up with a heat index of

720
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,320
157 meaning it feels like it's a hundred

721
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:07,850
fifty seven outside so in New Mexico we

722
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,059
don't really talk about this too much we

723
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,889
don't have much of a heat index here

724
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:14,989
because a relative humidities are

725
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:17,090
usually kind of especially in the summer

726
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:18,859
they're kind of in this range up in here

727
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,659
so we really don't have to worry about

728
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:22,580
this too much if you live in the

729
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:27,440
southeast for example they deal with

730
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:30,259
this a lot now what we do get in New

731
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,169
Mexico a lot is the second one here hot

732
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:35,450
date and low relative humidity that

733
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:38,029
produces desiccation meaning that your

734
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,039
skin dries out right so you know when we

735
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:42,970
have these days especially in New Mexico

736
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:44,720
they occur usually in June is is the

737
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,580
time where we have the hottest

738
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,889
temperatures and the lowest relative

739
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,409
humidity in your lips are dry and your

740
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:54,019
skin is dry and your itchy all that

741
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:56,929
stuff right so that's because a little

742
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:58,909
relative humidity and then it also

743
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:01,220
affects the way you feel cold

744
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:03,529
temperatures as well so when it's cold

745
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:08,750
and the relatively relative humidity is

746
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:11,270
high it does feel colder to you another

747
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:14,329
reason that we use relative humidity is

748
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:17,059
for fire danger so when you have low

749
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:19,190
relative humidity that means it's much

750
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:20,990
easier to start a fire and then once the

751
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:25,099
fire starts it's much easier for that

752
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:27,169
fire to keep burning and then finally

753
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:28,250
it's related to evaporation rate and

754
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:30,319
we're going to talk about this in the

755
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,049
next lecture but when you have low

756
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:38,809
relative humidity you have very rapid

757
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:40,579
evaporation so let's go back this is a

758
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:42,710
question that they had the beginning of

759
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:45,169
this lecture temperature in this

760
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,579
classroom of 75 the dew point is 54 I

761
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:50,659
changed the thermostat and the

762
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:53,919
temperature rises to 85 degrees as the

763
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:56,450
room warms up what happens

764
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,250
dew point increases dew point decreases

765
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:01,099
dew point doesn't change not enough

766
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,750
information well in this case if I just

767
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,049
increase the temperature

768
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,650
I'm not increasing the amount of water

769
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:08,690
in the air

770
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,790
I'm not decreasing the amount of water

771
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,160
in the air dew point does not change

772
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:15,680
okay so this is what we're saying in the

773
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,780
beginning of this lecture that when we

774
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,460
increase temperature and we decrease

775
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,450
temperature if we're not adding or

776
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,220
subtracting water

777
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,820
dew points and mixing ratios don't

778
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,130
change

779
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,500
I take this exact same problem and they

780
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:32,120
just change one thing instead of dew

781
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:37,890
points I change it to relative humidity

782
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:39,630
now as I warm the room up the bottom of

783
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,160
the fraction of relative humidity

784
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:44,130
changes right

785
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,320
so this is a typical problem that you

786
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:51,660
might face so as I warm the room up I'm

787
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,320
dividing by a number that's getting

788
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,230
bigger

789
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,890
so my overall answer is getting smaller

790
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:00,960
so in this case the relative humidity

791
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,580
decreases so this is what you got to

792
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,440
keep track of you got to keep track of

793
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,840
dew point mixing ratio and relative

794
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,690
humidity if you add water to the air

795
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,700
what will do each of those do if you

796
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,770
subtract water from the air what do each

797
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,080
of those do if you increase the

798
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:19,050
temperature what to each of those do

799
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,520
when you lower the temperature what do

800
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,590
each of those do okay

801
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,380
so again if you're one of my students on

802
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:29,070
learn the next quiz or question is all

803
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,520
about this all right thanks for

804
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,520
listening

805
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,960
you
