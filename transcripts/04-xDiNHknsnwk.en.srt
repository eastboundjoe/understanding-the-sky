2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,269
hey this is Mel strong and this is a

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,940
little extra help for people who are

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,770
still struggling to understand the

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,750
difference between dew point and

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,779
relative humidity and how they're

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,000
related so I'm gonna use this little

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,070
interactive tool from the University of

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,160
Wisconsin so I've put a link up on learn

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,189
and on my website so you can play with

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,020
this too and so over on the right hand

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,180
side here cuz we're gonna ignore the

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,030
left for now on the right hand side

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,620
we've got a thermometer and we've got

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,010
dew point and we've got relative

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,600
humidity and as I I can make changes in

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,579
either the temperature of the dew point

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,480
and it will show me how that changes

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,460
relative humidity now when we did this

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,960
in my previous lecture if you watch my

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,859
lecture on relative humidity we

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,420
calculated it with mixing ratios now we

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,879
could have also done it with dew points

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,439
remember both mixing ratio and dew point

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,760
tell you how much water is in the air

26
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,570
they're just two different ways of

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,130
reporting the same thing but it's the

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,189
calculation to get the relative humidity

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,549
is much more difficult if you only have

30
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,119
dew point so this doesn't have mixing

31
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,979
ratio in it but it's the same concept so

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,140
right now the temperature is a little

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,909
bit above sixty degrees the dew point

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,540
looks like it's a little below 40 and

35
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,020
our relative humidity is 38 percent okay

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,659
so if I raise the temperature so I just

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,270
drag this up you notice what's happening

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,950
to the relative humidity as that

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,649
temperature goes up the relative

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,420
humidity goes down so to relate this to

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,670
what we've done before with mixing

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,490
ratios we said the top of the fraction

43
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,350
was the current mixing ratio that's not

44
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,329
changing because dew point is not

45
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,130
changing remember dew point mixing

46
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,200
really shall have to change together if

47
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,299
I add more water to the air they both go

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,670
up if I subtract bar from the air they

49
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,530
both go down the fact that dew point is

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,310
not changing tells me that the amount of

51
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,009
water in the air is still a constant but

52
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,230
I mean I increased the temperature just

53
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,940
then

54
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,390
so again to relate that to what we've

55
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,269
seen before I'm dividing by the maximum

56
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,519
possible mixing ratio and the maximum

57
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,040
possible mixing ratio goes up as

58
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,910
temperature goes up dividing by a bigger

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,870
number gets me a smaller answer so as I

60
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,890
raise the temperature you saw the

61
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,150
relative humidity decreased so I will

62
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,620
continue the race if the temperature

63
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,480
will make as hot as we can make it

64
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,910
relative humidity goes down the five

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,739
percent okay so watch what happens when

66
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,900
I cool it down so I'm going to cool down

67
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:46,340
the temperature so I cool it down and I

68
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,799
cool it down and notice the relative

69
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,480
humidity is increasing the dew points

70
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,739
not changing because I'm not taking

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,690
water from the air okay so I'm going to

72
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,769
tropic further cool it cool it and

73
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,299
notice that the relative humidity

74
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:04,040
continues to go higher and higher and so

75
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,750
now as I as I'm getting closer and

76
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,459
closer to the dew point the dew points a

77
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,220
little below 40 I'm getting I'm getting

78
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,440
close notice how high my relative

79
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,780
humidity is so I'm gonna drop it even

80
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,030
further

81
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,340
dropped out okay so now relative

82
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,859
humidity is a hundred percent

83
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,069
temperature and dew point are the same

84
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,380
okay

85
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:27,530
so I'm going to continue to cool it

86
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,900
further so we would be making do at this

87
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,489
point even though the picture shows snow

88
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,639
that's not quite correct because we're

89
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,959
above freezing but we would be making do

90
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,750
okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna lower the

91
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,700
temperature so as I lower the

92
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,590
temperature notice what happens to the

93
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,040
dew point the dew point has to go down

94
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,519
with it but the relative humidity stays

95
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,930
at exactly 100% right so I can now we're

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,239
below freezing for sure we're making

97
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,459
Frost but I'll keep going down and keep

98
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,109
going down and keep going down and as

99
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,989
long as I keep making it colder and

100
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,760
colder the dew point has to go lower and

101
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,010
lower because I'm taking water out of

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,780
the air and putting it onto the ground

103
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,680
at first it was liquid and then it's

104
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,310
frozen but that entire time the relative

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,299
humidity was staying at 100% so now

106
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,190
let's say I warm it up so now the dew

107
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:22,039
point is really low the dew point looks

108
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,510
like it's about negative 10 and as I

109
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:26,430
warm the temperature up you see the

110
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:30,870
relative humidity rapidly drop

111
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,750
now this is not completely realistic

112
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,360
because normally what happens if you if

113
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,580
we may do in the more overnight and the

114
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,229
do sitting on the grass then when the

115
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,970
Sun comes up the next day that do

116
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,250
evaporates back into the air at least

117
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,710
most of it does and the dew point would

118
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,539
go back up what this is doing is once we

119
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,509
lowered the dew point it's keeping it

120
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:54,630
lowered right so that's a not quite what

121
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,250
happens in nature usually so here's

122
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,820
another thing I could do so let me crank

123
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:03,060
up the temperature to sixty relative

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,030
humidity is four percent if I add water

125
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,610
to the air I increase dew point right so

126
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,260
I can crank up the dew point as I

127
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,440
cranked up the dew point relative

128
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,810
humidity is also increasing now in this

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,580
case it's increasing because we think

130
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,560
again back to the definition of relative

131
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,979
humidity that we used with with mixing

132
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,550
ratios the top part of that fraction was

133
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,380
the the current mixing ratio how do you

134
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,910
increase the current mixing ratio you

135
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,490
add more water to the air you add more

136
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,889
grams of water to the air increasing dew

137
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,090
point is the same thing if I add water

138
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,949
to the air dew point goes up so we don't

139
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,210
see a process here you have to imagine

140
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,460
there's someone off the screen that's

141
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,430
adding water to the air somehow as I

142
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,020
crank this up so there's some mechanism

143
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,180
that we can't see that as I crank this

144
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,800
up I'm adding do I'm adding water vapor

145
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,919
to the air and the dew point

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,010
consequently is going up the temperature

147
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,139
is the same but as I add water relative

148
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,010
humidity goes up with it so go up and up

149
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,580
and up and up and up

150
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:10,050
and then when I get up to about there I

151
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:13,650
am 100% relative humidity temperature

152
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,960
and dew point are the same if I it is

153
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,729
physically impossible for me to have dew

154
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,010
point above temperature so the way this

155
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,889
software handles this is if I try to

156
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,630
crank dew point higher it also just

157
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,570
raises the temperature so that you don't

158
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,370
have math that makes no sense but in

159
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,349
reality if I was actually adding water

160
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,279
to the air the temperature does not

161
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:37,119
magically go up okay that's kind of a

162
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:40,789
limitation of this of this

163
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:43,639
software simulation so here two

164
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:46,490
temperature eighty degrees dew point

165
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,379
eighty degrees relative for me 100% this

166
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,360
would be a pretty miserable place to

167
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:52,479
live right now if you had this because

168
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,009
you as we talked about with the

169
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,119
evaporation lecture your sweat would not

170
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:02,539
evaporate so from here if I cool it down

171
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:04,939
I'm generating a condensation making do

172
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,879
making do making do a relative humidity

173
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:10,009
again stays of 100% then I can raise the

174
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,469
temperature back up and again the

175
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,149
dewpoint stays there because we have no

176
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:16,309
mechanism to add or subtract water from

177
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,939
the air so this is a little tool that

178
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:22,969
you can play with maybe it'll help on

179
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,259
the left hand side there is another

180
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,939
thing where what they're doing is

181
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,319
they've got an indoor thermometers and

182
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,969
so both of these things are outdoor

183
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,449
there's an indoor thermometer and then

184
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:35,180
indoor relative humidity and you can do

185
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,099
things like you can change the

186
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,770
temperature you can turn the air

187
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,409
conditioner on and off and you can see

188
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,909
what the effect is on the indoor

189
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,349
relative humidity so you can play with

190
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,749
that if you want you can open the door

191
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:51,639
and let in some outside air and see how

192
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:54,919
that changes the the point being that

193
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,990
often we have the same air outside as we

194
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,490
have inside right it's usually the same

195
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,559
air and if I have a relative humidity

196
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,409
gauge inside it'll have one reading on

197
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:09,080
it and I have a relative gate relative

198
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,149
humidity gauge outside it'll have a

199
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,069
different reading on it but the air is

200
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,330
the same why are the readings different

201
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,370
because the temperatures are different

202
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,469
that's why and that's what plane with

203
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,319
this allows you to allows you to mess

204
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:22,879
with that okay so I don't know if that

205
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,860
helps it up but you can go and play with

206
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,240
this to your heart's content and see if

207
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,490
you can understand the relationship

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,759
between dewpoint temperature relative

209
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,759
humidity
