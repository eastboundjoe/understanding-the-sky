1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,910
hey I'm Mel strong and this lecture is

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,620
on evaporation in latent heat we're

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,800
gonna start by looking at phase

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,140
transitions of water molecules so here

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,550
I've got a simulation from Phet and what

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,099
we're looking at are a bunch of water

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,619
molecules that are in a container that

8
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:29,779
we can see through and we talked about

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:32,509
this before but water molecules have

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:34,340
hydrogen on one side of the oxygen so

11
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,219
they kind of have this Mickey Mouse head

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,040
appearance to them so if you notice that

13
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,149
the water molecules right now are not

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,370
perfectly still

15
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:47,030
they're jiggling around a little bit

16
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:50,660
they're vibrating what we would say is

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,670
that they have vibrational energy now

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,530
despite the fact that they're moving a

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,780
little bit if you watch one for a long

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,629
time you'll notice that even though it's

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,329
vibrating it's not really changing its

22
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:05,120
position it doesn't really move very far

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:07,400
and it does not change position with its

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,930
neighbors okay I want to add a little

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:15,440
bit of heat okay so and I've warmed it

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:19,100
up and so the water molecules now look

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,760
nervous they are vibrating more and they

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,610
have more vibrational energy so this is

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,500
true with all atoms and molecules at

30
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,270
Absolute Zero which is zero degrees

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,330
Kelvin which is the coldest possible

32
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,380
temperature all motion stops and all

33
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:38,330
atoms and all molecules cease to vibrate

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:42,410
but at any of the temperature there's

35
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:44,780
some vibration of all substances now the

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:48,170
one where I make it the more vibrational

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,380
energy they have so despite the fact

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,910
that these guys are now vibrating more

39
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,590
you'll also notice that they still don't

40
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,180
really change the position with their

41
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,060
neighbors they stay bonded with their

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:03,940
neighbors also I want to point out these

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:07,070
holes this one that one that one a

44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,080
little one down there okay keep keep an

45
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,739
eye on those holes here and I'm going to

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,739
warm it up some more

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,170
okay right there something happened and

48
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,590
what happened is what we call a phase

49
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,530
transition we want from solid to liquid

50
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,749
in other words we want from ice to

51
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,730
liquid water and you'll notice what

52
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:30,370
happened when I did that so now the

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,329
water molecules are free to rotate so

54
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,939
you'll see some of them spinning

55
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,680
spinning around they're free to move

56
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:40,810
they don't have to stay in one spot

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,510
anymore those open spaces went away so

58
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,090
right now in the liquid state these

59
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,519
water molecules are free to bang into

60
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,569
each other and very slowly will migrate

61
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,239
around

62
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:57,549
okay one that I'm gonna refreeze it so

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,739
let's cool it down and we don't have the

64
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:01,689
big holes that we had before but here's

65
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,129
one down here it's a little one right

66
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:08,709
there so water molecules like to form

67
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,959
six-sided rings when they're in the

68
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:14,139
solid state and if you look at a

69
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,169
snowflake a snowflake is often six-sided

70
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:20,709
some are twelve sided and that six sided

71
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:22,449
symmetry comes from this it comes from

72
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,970
the fact that water molecules like to

73
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:28,019
assemble themselves with six-sided

74
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:31,329
symmetry even at the molecular level

75
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,909
okay so in a solid water molecules

76
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:37,900
they're not perfectly still but they're

77
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:39,609
in general are not moving very very

78
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,310
quickly they're not changing places with

79
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:45,609
their neighbors they're mostly staying

80
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,739
in the same spot when I warm it up they

81
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,269
are able to move around it's kind of

82
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,739
like this giant mosh pit of water

83
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,709
molecules they're all bumping into each

84
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:57,120
other and they are free to spin or move

85
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,680
around okay so I'm gonna heat it up more

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,259
so as I heat it up more what we're gonna

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,889
see is that they have more vibrational

88
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:07,870
energy they're spinning faster and

89
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:11,069
occasionally one of them breaks apart

90
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,840
from the herd and when that happens

91
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,919
we're seeing another phase transition

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,989
the transition between liquid and vapor

93
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,690
so at this particular temperature I can

94
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:26,270
see I've got a couple vapor molecules up

95
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:30,289
there and most of them are still

96
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm going to heat it up some more

97
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:36,900
and as I heated up some more I can see

98
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,289
more and more of the water molecules

99
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,719
going into the vapor state now let me

100
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:46,919
cool it back down so I cool it back down

101
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:50,520
and as I cool it down one of the things

102
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,430
that's going to happen is the vapor that

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,560
I have is going to condense down here

104
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,409
with the liquid and we turn to the

105
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,250
liquid state and notice that right now

106
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,050
compared to where I just had the

107
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,439
temperature I have very little water

108
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,060
molecules up in the vapor State okay so

109
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,250
this relates to something we learned

110
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,860
about two lectures ago and we had that

111
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,590
chart looking at maximum possible mixing

112
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,419
ratio with temperature and what we said

113
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,969
at the time is at the higher the

114
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,669
temperature the higher the maximum

115
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:22,889
possible mixing ratio could be and this

116
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:25,589
is an illustration of that when I make

117
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,620
it hotter more water molecules can enter

118
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:31,169
the vapor state when I have a colder

119
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,419
less water molecules can enter the vapor

120
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,339
State so here I'm warming it up again

121
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,860
and we're starting to see more of those

122
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:41,460
water molecules enter the state as it is

123
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,689
a vapor so those are the things that

124
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,439
keep in mind when you're trying to

125
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:49,469
visualize water molecules in a solid

126
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,750
they are gonna stay in one spot they

127
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:53,279
still vibrate a little bit in liquid

128
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,949
it's like the mosh pit they're all

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,289
elbowing each other in the vapor they're

130
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,659
free to move around and they typically

131
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:06,389
move in a straight line until they hit

132
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:08,729
something else or hit each other so

133
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,620
we're going to get into evaporation now

134
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:14,069
and one of the things to keep in mind

135
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,050
with evaporation is that whenever you

136
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,569
have a body of liquid water that's

137
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,339
exposed to the atmosphere there are

138
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,099
always going to be water molecules

139
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,409
leaving that liquid water and going into

140
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:28,259
the atmosphere and at the same time

141
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:30,899
there will be water molecules leaving

142
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,259
the atmosphere and entering the liquid

143
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:36,089
this is going on all the time so anytime

144
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,860
you've got liquid water no matter how

145
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,930
big the body of water is

146
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,860
you've got water molecules leaving

147
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,750
you've got water molecules coming back

148
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,000
now temperature is what controls the

149
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,580
rate at which they leave see if you've

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,940
got really cold water the water

151
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,980
molecules in this glass have relatively

152
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,410
low kinetic energy meaning that they're

153
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,420
not moving very fast and because they're

154
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,010
not moving very fast it's more difficult

155
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,620
for them to leave

156
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,860
the liquid surface of the water whereas

157
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,930
this glass because it's hotter the water

158
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,780
molecules have more kinetic energy

159
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,680
they're moving faster and they escape

160
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:19,500
the surface of the water or more easier

161
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,560
so there's a higher flux of water

162
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,460
molecules leaving the hot water than

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,350
there is the cold water now this relates

164
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,620
to something that we've talked about a

165
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,830
couple of lectures ago if I have an

166
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,960
atmosphere sitting over the ocean and we

167
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,000
would call that big blob of air and air

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,250
mass so we've got a big blob of air

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,550
sending over the Pacific Ocean this air

170
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,420
mass will pick up water vapor out of the

171
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,450
Pacific Ocean

172
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:52,170
but the Pacific Ocean is pretty cold and

173
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:54,720
so even though it's picking up water

174
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,720
vapor out of the ocean it doesn't get

175
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,030
that much compared if that same air mass

176
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,300
was sitting over say that Gulf of Mexico

177
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:07,070
Gulf of Mexico because that ocean is

178
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,570
warmer has a higher flux of water vapor

179
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,970
entering the air mass that's sitting

180
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,770
above it so when we talked about how

181
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,430
dewpoint will change with wind direction

182
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,070
this is the reason why air mass sits

183
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,530
over a warm ocean it picks up way more

184
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,380
water than the air mass sits over a cold

185
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,500
ocean if the wind comes from the west it

186
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,020
blows in this relatively dry air our dew

187
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,910
points typically are low if the wind

188
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,490
comes from the east and blows in this

189
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:40,200
air with relatively high dew points and

190
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,690
our dew points go up so I'm going to

191
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,690
show a couple diagrams with arrows that

192
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,970
represent the fluxes of the water

193
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,320
molecules leaving versus the water of

194
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,840
water molecules that are

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,240
turning so in this case what I'm trying

196
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,430
to show here is that I've got about

197
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,940
twice as many of the water molecules

198
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,990
leaving as I do of those returning okay

199
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,180
that's what that means

200
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,890
so imagine I've got three glasses of

201
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,210
water and each glass of water is the

202
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:12,190
same temperature but in each case they

203
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:15,040
are in an environment of different

204
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,500
relative humidities so what you would

205
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,710
notice is that in each case the amount

206
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,680
of water molecules leaving the flux is

207
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,960
the same for each remember that's what

208
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,280
the red arrow stands for and it's

209
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,140
dependent on temperature and the

210
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,650
temperature is the same so all three red

211
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,440
arrows are the same but where we have

212
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,320
low relative humidities we actually see

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,130
very few water molecules returning

214
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,280
whereas with moderate humidities we see

215
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,420
more water molecules returning and when

216
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,210
we get to a hundred percent relative

217
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,510
humidity we see equal rates of those

218
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,630
leaving and those returning so if you

219
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,610
think about evaporation as a net loss of

220
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,210
water which glass is going to dry up

221
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,420
first

222
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,730
well this one is losing way more than

223
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,480
it's gaining so this one is going to dry

224
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,880
up first

225
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,060
and in fact relative humidity is

226
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,480
correlated to the evaporation rate so

227
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:16,600
when you have low relative humidities

228
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,760
you have rapid evaporation whereas when

229
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,240
you get to moderate relative humidities

230
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,610
the evaporation rate is slower and when

231
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,950
you get to 100% evaporate relative

232
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:31,930
humidity you actually get no evaporation

233
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,220
at all so for us in New Mexico in June

234
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,500
we typically have the highest

235
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,350
temperatures with the lowest dew points

236
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,050
and what that ends up with is very very

237
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,640
low relative humidities so we'll get

238
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,740
relative humidities sometimes 1% or less

239
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,280
now if you've ever mopped your floor in

240
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,530
June one of the things you may notice is

241
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,110
that your floor will dry just about as

242
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:59,800
fast as you can mop there's a very very

243
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:02,750
high evaporation rate when do we get

244
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,950
into the monsoon and

245
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,510
we'll talk about the monsoon in the

246
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,550
future lecture but the relative humidity

247
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,550
does go up we get more water in the

248
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,410
atmosphere the evaporation rate slows

249
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,360
down a little bit in your if you mop

250
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:18,520
your floor it takes a little longer for

251
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,110
it to dry now here's an example question

252
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,180
we have three sponges and each one have

253
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,640
the same amount of water in them and

254
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,260
each are the same temperature the only

255
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,690
difference is that each of these are in

256
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:34,630
a different environment of relative

257
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:37,370
humidity which sponge dries up first and

258
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,800
this one has the lowest relative

259
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,870
humidity so this sponge is going to dry

260
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:48,020
it first because it's evaporation rate

261
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:50,030
will be higher relative humidity of a

262
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,730
hundred percent is kind of a rare thing

263
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,020
especially here in New Mexico but I want

264
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,420
to talk about it a little bit because

265
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,430
it's kind of a weird to think about so

266
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,460
if you lived in an environment where the

267
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,860
relative humidity was a hundred percent

268
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:07,160
every time one water molecule leaves the

269
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,710
glass another one would immediately have

270
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,680
to return and take its place so what

271
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,080
that means is that it doesn't matter how

272
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,740
long you left this glass of water out it

273
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,290
would never ever ever evaporate however

274
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,120
let's imagine you had some way to go in

275
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,770
there and identify all the water

276
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,570
molecules let's say you could put little

277
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,600
tiny nametags and all the water

278
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,820
molecules and you and then you let it

279
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,490
sit there for days and weeks and months

280
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,640
and you could go in and you could check

281
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,850
and check who's in there what you would

282
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,160
notice as time went on as you'd see less

283
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,220
and less of the original water molecules

284
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,589
that were in your glass and they've all

285
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,480
been replaced by these strangers that

286
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,040
came in from the atmosphere so

287
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,690
eventually if you did if you let this

288
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,300
stay here long enough all of the water

289
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,640
molecules in your glass of water would

290
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,740
be gone and they'd all be replaced with

291
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:06,170
these new ones that came in from the

292
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,880
atmosphere okay for this next part you

293
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,800
need to use your imagination a little

294
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,200
bit and we're working up towards

295
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,540
something called latent heat but to get

296
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,010
there I have a goofy story that I have

297
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,660
to explain

298
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,940
just stick with me a little bit it'll

299
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,770
make sense in the end I hope so the

300
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,450
first thing I want you to imagine is

301
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,360
that the world is covered in these

302
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,520
little tiny microscopic boxes you can't

303
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,100
see them but if you could they have a

304
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,740
label on them each one says thermal

305
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,470
energy and these boxes are all over the

306
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,540
place but if you took a bunch of these

307
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,700
boxes and he started adding them to

308
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,370
something the thing you add them to

309
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,830
would get warmer so we start throwing

310
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,650
these boxes in this little pond the pond

311
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,630
would warm up however we could also

312
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,270
reach down into the pond and grab those

313
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,180
same boxes and pull them out and if you

314
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,330
took them away the pond would become

315
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,760
cooler so anything you add them to

316
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:06,460
becomes warmer anything you take them

317
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:09,170
away from becomes cooler okay so now

318
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,990
imagine that the water molecules they

319
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:14,540
live in this kingdom that they have and

320
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,400
there are these rules and the rules are

321
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,100
regarding these little boxes and the

322
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,190
first rule that they have is that if you

323
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,930
are ever in the vapor State you have to

324
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,720
carry one of these boxes a thermal

325
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,150
energy with you everywhere you go okay

326
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,500
doesn't matter how long you're in the

327
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,920
atmosphere it doesn't matter where you

328
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,440
go if you're in the vapor State you have

329
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,110
to carry a box with you at all times

330
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,460
no exceptions okay they're very strict

331
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,900
about this all right

332
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:47,180
so rule number two if you go from the

333
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,940
vapor state and land back into liquid

334
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,160
somewhere you have to release your box

335
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,080
into the liquid doesn't matter if you

336
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,270
landed in the ocean if you land in the

337
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,030
river if you land in someone's glass of

338
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:02,630
water you've got to release your box as

339
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,610
soon as you land that's the rule okay so

340
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,940
what that means is if you could look

341
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,520
really closely at a body of liquid water

342
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,290
you would see there are boxes of thermal

343
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,630
energy floating around from all the

344
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,570
water molecules that have landed and

345
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,470
then you'd see the water molecules

346
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,870
bouncing into each other like the

347
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,650
animation that we saw okay so these

348
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,540
boxes are just going to stay there until

349
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:28,970
somebody leaves because rule number

350
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,790
three is if you ever leave

351
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,129
liquid state you have to take a box of

352
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:38,060
thermal energy with you okay that's the

353
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:39,740
rule because to be in vapor state you

354
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,689
have to have a box so what they do is is

355
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,040
these boxes floating around it doesn't

356
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:44,360
matter whose is who is they don't keep

357
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,519
track it doesn't matter they're all the

358
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:51,949
same you just have to grab one before

359
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:54,470
you go okay so what this means is if we

360
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:58,160
think about fluxes of water molecules

361
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:00,970
leaving and returning if we've got more

362
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,550
guys leaving than we have coming back

363
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,860
these guys are pulling out more boxes of

364
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:11,029
thermal energy then these guys are

365
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,670
returning we have a net loss of thermal

366
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:17,240
energy we also have a net loss of water

367
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:19,730
molecules but if we do that because

368
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,360
we're removing more thermal energy than

369
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:26,269
we are replacing the liquid down here is

370
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,970
going to become cooler because it's

371
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,910
losing thermal energy as a net loss of

372
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,529
thermal energy on the other hand if we

373
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,990
had a situation where we had more of

374
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:39,160
these guys arriving dropping their boxes

375
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:42,319
off into the liquid then we had leaving

376
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,470
then we would have a net addition of

377
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:48,230
thermal energy and the liquid would warm

378
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,509
on account of this okay so depending on

379
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,970
the fluxes of how many you have leaving

380
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,819
and how many have coming back the body

381
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,430
of water could get cooler or could get

382
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,059
warmer so let's go over a couple

383
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,490
examples of how this works in real life

384
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:07,520
so as humans when we get hot we sweat

385
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,130
and the sweat is mostly water and the

386
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,589
water comes out you know it's exactly

387
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,740
the same temperature as your body so the

388
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:19,400
sweat by itself does not cool you but

389
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:23,059
your body is relying on the evaporation

390
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,339
and if the conditions are right then

391
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,549
when water molecules evaporate off of

392
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,419
your skin they are removing those little

393
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,980
units of thermal energy and the

394
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:37,909
remaining water the remaining sweat or

395
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:40,659
your skin becomes cooler which means

396
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:42,350
that if you're human and you're sweating

397
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:47,059
what relative

398
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:49,669
community conditions do you prefer so in

399
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:52,250
order for sweat to work you need rapid

400
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:55,370
evaporation rapid evaporation requires

401
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,100
low relative humidity so if you're

402
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,710
sweating it works best if you have low

403
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,600
relative humidity you've probably been

404
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,730
in a situation where you've been in high

405
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,890
relative humidity and hot temperatures

406
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,780
that's pretty miserable and one of the

407
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,940
reasons it's miserable is because your

408
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,220
sweat simply is not evaporating very

409
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:17,120
much so there's very little latent heat

410
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,159
being removed from your body there's

411
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,130
another example kind of in the opposite

412
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,260
direction so we've got a teapot here

413
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:28,690
there's water in there that's boiling

414
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:31,520
and what's coming out is water vapor

415
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,980
except you actually can't see water

416
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,919
vapor water vapor water vapor is

417
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,230
invisible and so we commonly refer to

418
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,240
this as steam and steam has several

419
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,630
definitions but one definition is that

420
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,960
it's a mixture of water vapor that you

421
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,390
cannot see and little tiny droplets of

422
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,980
liquid that you can see so the part we

423
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,809
can see is actually a little tiny

424
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,460
microscopic droplets but there's water

425
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:57,200
vapor in here for this example let's

426
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,539
imagine that this is all just water

427
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,909
vapor okay and so the water vapor is

428
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:04,429
coming out and if you are unfortunate

429
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:05,840
enough to put your hand in the stream of

430
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:09,500
water vapor that's coming out of the

431
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,350
teapot the individual water molecules

432
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,179
that come out are the temperature of

433
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,039
boiling water because that's where they

434
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,070
just came from and they land on your

435
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:21,770
hand and they transfer that heat to your

436
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,500
hand and that burns you right that's

437
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,330
that hurts but it's actually worse than

438
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,190
that because not only are they

439
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,530
transferring the heat that they

440
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,299
themselves are carrying but they're also

441
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,610
showing up with their little boxes of

442
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:37,400
thermal energy that they took out of the

443
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,679
water in the teapot and when they land

444
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,659
on your hand not only are they

445
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,880
transferring their high temperature to

446
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:46,220
your hand but they're also depositing

447
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,020
their little boxes of thermal energy so

448
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,690
you kind of have to imagine thermal

449
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,809
energy just be piling up on your hand as

450
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,060
these water molecules land on your hand

451
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:59,330
so you have the heat

452
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,310
of the hot water molecules plus you've

453
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,670
got the accumulated heat of all of their

454
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:07,430
thermal energy units being piled on so

455
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:10,100
this produces a steam burn in a steam

456
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,860
burn if you've ever had one especially

457
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,080
nasty because it's a burn that's hotter

458
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,660
than what you would get in boiling water

459
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,480
is the temperature of boiling water plus

460
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:24,500
extra thermal energy on top of that so

461
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,560
it's a really painful type of burn in

462
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,620
nature we talked about how do will form

463
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,530
if we cool the air below the dew point

464
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,900
and so what we talked about earlier a

465
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,480
couple of lectures ago is that as we

466
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,010
cool the temperatures off at night if we

467
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,380
get below the dew point we will start

468
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,740
growing do usually on a very thin

469
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,210
surface like grass well the other thing

470
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,340
that actually happens during this

471
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,850
process is that as the water molecules

472
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,040
come down to join this growing dew drop

473
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,400
they're adding their little boxes of

474
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:02,330
thermal energy to this drop in so the

475
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,750
formation to do actually adds heat to

476
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,090
the the grass so this is a little

477
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,370
confusing because we said you got you

478
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,870
got to cool the temperatures down to get

479
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,350
to the dew point and that's still true

480
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,660
but what we're saying now is as you make

481
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,000
do that's actually adding some heat back

482
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,370
into the environment it doesn't warm the

483
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,870
environment up but it prevents it from

484
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:28,580
cooling down as much as it normally

485
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:30,710
would so here's back to our sponge

486
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,150
question except I've I've changed it a

487
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,790
little bit so the beginning is the same

488
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,580
as we saw before so we have three

489
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:39,230
sponges each is wet each is the same

490
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,900
temperature each has the same amount of

491
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,690
water in it and the only difference is

492
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,000
the relative humidity next to each

493
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,180
sponge right so we have these three

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,590
sponges and we said before that this one

495
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,550
is the one that's going to evaporate

496
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,110
first so now the question is instead you

497
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,510
let them sit for 15 minutes and you

498
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:04,640
return to fine all three still damp

499
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:07,370
which one is the coldest so the relative

500
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,010
humidity here is the lowest this one

501
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,950
dries the first but not only is

502
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,920
evaporation the most rapid on this one

503
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:18,890
but we're also losing thermal energy

504
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,020
more rapidly on this one so when we come

505
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,390
back in 15 minutes this one will be the

506
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,730
driest and it will be the coldest

507
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:29,780
because it has lost the most thermal

508
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:31,400
energy so this concept that we've been

509
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,370
talking about where I invented this with

510
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,800
a world of boxes and X and all that that

511
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:41,270
is actually known as science is latent

512
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,160
heat in latent means hidden so latent

513
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,960
heat are these little packets of energy

514
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,170
that you cannot see but they're

515
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,390
transferred between water molecules when

516
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,670
they change phases so as they go from

517
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,920
from liquid to vapor and back from vapor

518
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:58,520
to liquid they transfer this energy back

519
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:02,570
and forth latent heat is a giant source

520
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,910
of energy in weather and climate so when

521
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,700
we when we look at say thunderstorms or

522
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,320
hurricanes part of the energy a big

523
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,860
chunk of the energy that's keeping those

524
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,230
storms going is actually latent heat

525
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,270
it's the is these little tiny packets of

526
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,520
energy being transferred from water

527
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,620
molecules as they go from one phase to

528
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,370
the other so it's a pretty big deal in

529
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:31,040
weather and climate a couple more

530
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:33,320
examples so humans we sweat and latent

531
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:37,250
heat is removed from our body dogs

532
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,190
cannot sweat so they pant and so what

533
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,920
dogs are relying on is the removal of

534
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:46,040
latent heat from their tongue so they

535
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,960
have a big wet sloppy tongue and the

536
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,780
evaporation occurs over the tongue and

537
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,990
water molecules remove latent heat from

538
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,280
their tongue and that cools their tongue

539
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,890
and there's blood vessels in their

540
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,300
tongue that then take that you know the

541
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,680
blood cools on their tongue and that

542
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,540
gets circulated throughout their body

543
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,340
and that's their cooling mechanism

544
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,440
there's a little bit of cooling as they

545
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,750
move air back and forth over the tongue

546
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,660
from the outside but the main purpose of

547
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,540
panting is to increase evaporation over

548
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,910
the tongue so if you have bullet hot

549
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,740
soup and you blow on the soup that's to

550
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:22,280
increase the evaporation rate that route

551
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,280
that removes extra latent heat so in a

552
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,040
in a

553
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,380
panting dog as the air moves back and

554
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,750
forth over his tongue it's increasing

555
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:35,730
the evaporation rate losing latent heat

556
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,860
to cool the dog or cat so what would a

557
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:41,370
dog rather have high relative humidity

558
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,470
or low relative humidity and so just

559
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,600
like us in order for their panting to be

560
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,090
effective like our sweating to be

561
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,430
effective they prefer to be in the low

562
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,900
relative humidity environments so if you

563
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:54,060
have a dog and you live in a place with

564
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,280
high relative humidity and he's panting

565
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,080
his panting probably isn't doing much

566
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,150
good as a little dog you bringing

567
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,470
doesn't know this but he's panting and

568
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,750
panting and panting like he thinks it's

569
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:06,450
gonna help it's just not helping because

570
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,660
wait and he is not being removed from

571
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:12,030
his tongue like he's expecting so a dog

572
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,220
in a environment that's hot with a

573
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,710
hundred percent relative humidity has no

574
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,840
way of cooling himself and for us in

575
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,850
terms of if we were sweating in an

576
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:26,100
environment of 100% relative humidity

577
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:28,170
we can't cool ourselves either so if you

578
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,960
live in New Mexico or almost anywhere in

579
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,850
the in the southwest you probably have

580
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,070
something called a swamp cooler on your

581
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:39,900
roof also known as an evaporative cooler

582
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:41,610
and inside this cooler on around each of

583
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,800
the four sometimes they have three sighs

584
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,020
some things they have four sides there

585
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,110
are these what look like giant sponges

586
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,330
that we call pads and inside the pads

587
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:55,980
are kept wet so there's a pool of water

588
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:57,450
underneath so this is what you cut one

589
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,610
open this is what it looks like there so

590
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,980
this is filled with water down here and

591
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,110
there's a whole fountain and it dribbles

592
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,390
the water down there's the pads right

593
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,690
there and it keeps them wet then this

594
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:12,420
thing is a big motor big fan that sucks

595
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:15,030
air and it sucks air in and it boils it

596
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:18,120
down into the house so that's what this

597
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:20,100
is okay so the air comes in through the

598
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,570
pads and as it comes in through the pads

599
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:27,030
the the wetness of this of the pad

600
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,520
causes evaporation so water is

601
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:32,370
evaporating from these pads and as it

602
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,010
does so the evaporation removes thermal

603
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,049
energy removes latent heat and the

604
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:40,379
result the residual water

605
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:43,820
the left is cooler and as the air runs

606
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:47,190
through that cooler pad it cools the air

607
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,470
so in my animation here I have water

608
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,629
molecules leaving and going up in the

609
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,149
atmosphere some do that but a lot of

610
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:56,940
them actually go the evaporate into the

611
00:26:54,149 --> 00:27:01,049
air that is then pushed into your house

612
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:04,350
so part of the result of this is that it

613
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:06,629
actually adds water vapor to the air in

614
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,100
your house so typically you know this

615
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:10,830
might be the setup it might be United

616
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,100
five degrees outside only 10 percent

617
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,879
relative humidity the air gets drawn in

618
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,289
goes to the wet pads evaporation occurs

619
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:22,019
cooling occurs remove of latent heat

620
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:25,859
occurs and then that the air now is

621
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:28,470
maybe 15 degrees colder than it was but

622
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:29,789
now it's the relative humidity is higher

623
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,590
and for two reasons

624
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:33,869
number one as we learned in the previous

625
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,970
lecture if I just cool the temperature

626
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:38,909
down I will increase relative humidity

627
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:41,369
and number two a lot of the evaporation

628
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:43,350
that takes place actually adds water to

629
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:45,029
the air that's going through the swamp

630
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,299
cooler itself so the air that's coming

631
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:50,609
into your house has more water vapor in

632
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,590
the air itself and so you have a higher

633
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:54,809
relative humidity and a higher mixing

634
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:58,230
ratio and a higher dew point inside your

635
00:27:54,809 --> 00:28:01,590
house as a result so we have these all

636
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:04,769
over the Southwest and this is a map of

637
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:07,320
relative humidity of the entire country

638
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:11,549
and this is a national average average

639
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,049
over a whole whole year so what you'll

640
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:14,639
see here now if we can read this but it

641
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,909
says relative humidity percent and this

642
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:20,519
is says 20 to 35 and then the 30 is 40s

643
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:22,559
50s 70s and this is average again over

644
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,629
the whole year so the winter and summer

645
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,869
the whole thing but what you notice is

646
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:29,639
that right here this area that kind of

647
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:31,739
brownish area this is the area that has

648
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:34,859
the lowest relative humidity in the

649
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:37,379
country and if you have a swamp cooler

650
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:38,669
an evaporative cooler this is the part

651
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:41,009
of the world the part of the country

652
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:43,710
sorry that it's actually going to work

653
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:46,679
best because if I go back if the

654
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,840
relative humidity is too high I don't

655
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,640
have much evaporation if I don't have

656
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,650
much evaporation I don't have

657
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,500
much cooling so the only way this thing

658
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:58,410
works is if I have very low relative

659
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,450
humidities once you get out into this

660
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,610
part of the country

661
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,110
nobody has swamp coolers people down

662
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,940
here don't even know the swamp core it

663
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,920
is they've never seen one because if you

664
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,570
built one you put one on your house it

665
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,870
would do nothing because you've got like

666
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,980
like that green zone right there that's

667
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:17,460
relative humidities that are routinely

668
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,840
over 80% if you had a swamp cooler and

669
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,420
you turn it on there'd be so little

670
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:25,080
evaporation you notice no cooling effect

671
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:27,180
at all so really realistically when we

672
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,940
get really kind of east of the Sandia

673
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,380
Mountains kind of right through here

674
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,200
nobody over here has swamp cores because

675
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,410
they just are very ineffective this area

676
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,840
the desert southwest of swamp coolers

677
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,900
worked especially during those months

678
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,610
with a little relative humidity so why

679
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,710
do we have that instead of normal

680
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,660
refrigerated air because everybody over

681
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:52,110
here has what we call air conditioning

682
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,520
normal refrigerated air the advantage of

683
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,620
swamp coolers is they are cheaper to

684
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,180
make and they're cheaper to run so they

685
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,390
don't require nearly as much electricity

686
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,000
as refrigerated air so you could put

687
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,220
refrigerated air on your house and it

688
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,380
would be colder but it also cost a lot

689
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,970
more so that's why you see a lot of

690
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,550
these swamp coolers in this part of the

691
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,930
country they are cheap to build and

692
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:16,820
they're cheap to run and they work

693
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:20,490
because we have low relative humidity

694
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:23,370
okay so take-home points from this whole

695
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:25,710
lecture water molecules are always

696
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,800
leaving and entering the surface of a

697
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,020
liquid all times and depending on the

698
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,220
temperature the flux of water molecules

699
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,040
you know there's height there's a higher

700
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:38,220
flux of water leaving warmer water than

701
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,320
there there is cooler water the rate of

702
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,480
the molecules returning is controlled by

703
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,430
relative humidity right so the higher

704
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,060
the relative humidity the more water

705
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:50,160
molecules are coming back the lower the

706
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,500
relative humidity the higher the

707
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:56,010
evaporation rate so we talked about that

708
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,830
and then when water exchanges phases it

709
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:01,290
exchanges these small little invisible

710
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,610
packets of energy that we call thermal

711
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,290
energy and so I made up the whole story

712
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,600
with the little boxes so they

713
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,730
you can visualize that just to make sure

714
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,710
we're Claire there are no little tiny

715
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,350
boxes that say thermal energy lying

716
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,330
around okay that's a whole visual so you

717
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,580
can kind of understand the concept but

718
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,190
when water makes transitions between

719
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,940
phases it transfers these little packets

720
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,430
of energy along we call that latent heat

721
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:29,700
evaporation removes latent heat

722
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:31,410
condensation adds latent heat alright so

723
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,530
next time we will talk about how all of

724
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,890
this works to make clouds thanks for

725
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,890
watching

726
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,370
you
