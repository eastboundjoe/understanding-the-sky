1
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,429
hey I'm Mel strong and this is a lecture

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,500
on cloud formation and convection in the

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,049
atmosphere if you haven't watched the

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,460
lectures on humidity first go back and

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,140
do that because we're gonna be talking

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,010
about dewpoint and relative humidity

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,279
here

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,080
so to recap what we've been saying so

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,240
far is if you take a body air and you

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,880
cool it down to its dew point you will

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,160
hit saturation and as you cool it

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,160
further air molecules will come out of

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,800
the vapor State and form drops of liquid

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,809
on the surfaces that cool first and the

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,079
surfaces that cool first are the

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,480
thinnest ones which are usually grass

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,629
now the same exact process is happening

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,390
up in the sky when we see a cloud when

19
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,510
you see a cloud all that really is is a

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,930
blob of air that has been cooled down to

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,480
its dew point so the same process

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,120
happens the air becomes saturated as it

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,920
gets cooled further water molecules must

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,990
leave the vapor state and enter the

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,030
liquid state and what's different is

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,729
that on the ground this happens on a

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,970
surface like grass so what's the surface

28
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,799
up here well there are these little

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,030
microscopic particles in the atmosphere

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,060
you might know them as dust or smoke or

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,000
soot or this tiny little salt crystals

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,040
where the ocean waves hit each other out

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,159
in the ocean and make sea spray the sea

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,479
spray evaporates and makes tiny little

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,549
salt crystals that fly through the

36
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,780
atmosphere they find them all over above

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,460
the continents they're all over the

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,560
place and we call these things

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,229
condensation nuclei because they're

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,310
going to form the surfaces when water

41
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,290
molecules come together so here's an

42
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,970
illustration of the sizes of the things

43
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,509
we're talking about here so here we have

44
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,299
a human here for scale and first thing

45
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,549
to point out is that the cloud droplets

46
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,119
the little spheres of water that are in

47
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,610
clouds are actually themselves

48
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,829
microscopic so a raindrop might be this

49
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,259
size we're not making raindrops here

50
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,030
we're making cloud drops in the next

51
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,800
lecture we'll talk about how to get this

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,620
but for now we're talking about

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,860
how to get this these to get these two

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,170
different size cloud droplets water

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,940
vapor must form on a surface and the

56
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,590
surface it finds are these condensation

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,880
nuclei these these tiny little specks

58
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,230
that are in this diagram here so we can

59
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,020
look at some of these under scanning

60
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,640
electron microscope and dust can main

61
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,310
all kinds of things usually there are

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,970
fragments of rock though and so water

63
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,490
molecules when saturation occurs they

64
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,000
will start to condense on the surface of

65
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,730
this dust particle or it might be pollen

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,030
pollen has a lot of surface area and so

67
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,490
the the Centers of little cloud droplets

68
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,140
are often pollen grains or even bacteria

69
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,320
so there's bacteria in the atmosphere

70
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,600
flying around and water molecules will

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,960
collect on the bacteria some of these

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,970
are actually made by humans so this is

73
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,760
fly ash and these these little spheres

74
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,000
of carbon and they're made when you burn

75
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,130
coal and so coal power plants in this

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,930
country remove most of that but a lot of

77
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,970
it still gets into the atmosphere and

78
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,850
water molecules will collect on the

79
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,560
surfaces of these little spheres so all

80
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,580
of these things are examples of what

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,830
condensation nuclei look like so anytime

82
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,840
you see a cloud it's just air that's

83
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,060
been cooled to below its dew point and

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,459
as humans we can make clouds pretty

85
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,489
easily by just adding water vapor to air

86
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,050
that's already cold so we do this for

87
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,900
example on a cold morning so this person

88
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,300
is exhaling in the cold air and you can

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,730
quote-unquote see her breath which just

90
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,430
means that her breath has been cooled to

91
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,430
below its dew point so for example maybe

92
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,140
the temperature outside is 40 and the

93
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,650
dew point outside is 10 so we have

94
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,720
relatively dry air well think about the

95
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,220
air that's in her lungs right so your

96
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,830
your lungs are warm and they're moist

97
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,660
and the air that you breathe in picks up

98
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,209
a lot of water vapor from your lungs and

99
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,850
maybe the air that's coming out of your

100
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,519
mouth has a dew point of 60 or maybe

101
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,890
it's higher than 60 and the temperature

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,940
of your breath won't quite be body

103
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,910
temperature but it's gonna be pretty

104
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,340
warm and so you breathe out this air

105
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,300
that's pretty warm and as a dew point of

106
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,430
61

107
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,979
if the dewpoints 60 all we have to do is

108
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,970
cool it down to 60 and we'd start to

109
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,669
make a cloud

110
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,460
well it's temperature outside is 40 so

111
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:41,909
as she breathes out this air with dew

112
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,800
point of 60 is it cools down to 40 then

113
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:46,110
that water vapor that's in her breath

114
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,770
has to come out and form little tiny

115
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,810
liquid droplets and we see a cloud now

116
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,310
you might notice that on some days you

117
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,289
can see your breath but it doesn't last

118
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,629
long like it's just an instant and then

119
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:59,220
goes away in other days you can see your

120
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,590
breath and it seems to linger for a

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,539
while so let's change this a little bit

122
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,419
and let's say that the day is the same

123
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:10,530
temperature but the dew point is instead

124
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:13,080
of 10 is now 39 so notice that the dew

125
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,469
point is pretty close to the temperature

126
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,569
if they were the same relative humidity

127
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:20,610
is 100% they're not quite the same but

128
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,500
they're close so what we can say without

129
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,020
doing any math is that the relative

130
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,800
humidity is pretty high with these

131
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,569
conditions

132
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,270
dew points almost the same as

133
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,940
temperature on a day where the relative

134
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,130
humidity is really high your breath will

135
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,039
linger in the air longer because

136
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,560
remember relative humidity is related to

137
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,389
evaporation if I have low relative

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,719
humidity I have a high rate of

139
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,940
evaporation so in the first example when

140
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:49,800
the dew point was 10 her breath might

141
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,529
not last very long at all because the

142
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,719
evaporation rate is so great that those

143
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:57,300
little droplets are quickly evaporating

144
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:59,520
in this case because the relative

145
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,550
humidity is high her breath will linger

146
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,690
in the air much longer so if you see you

147
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,340
know you have a morning where you can

148
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,719
see a big cloud around people when

149
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,729
they're breathing and it seems to linger

150
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,650
in the air one of the things you can

151
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,360
learn from that is that the relative

152
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:16,469
humidity must be pretty high on that

153
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,509
particular day also and this is harder

154
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:21,270
to see but this one picture kind of

155
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,520
shows it there will be a gap between the

156
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,800
person's mouth and when the cloud forms

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,779
and the reason for that is the air

158
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,400
that's coming out of their mouth is

159
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,229
pretty close to their body temperature

160
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,879
and you've got to cool it down to the

161
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,710
dew point and it takes a little while

162
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,050
for that to happen so there'll be a

163
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,089
little space here where there's no cloud

164
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,300
until you finally hit the dew point

165
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,039
right there

166
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,129
and then the heirs continued to cool

167
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,810
further now there's another way that we

168
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:49,930
add water to the atmosphere and that's

169
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,120
the burning fuel so hydrocarbons are a

170
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,560
class of molecules and they get their

171
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,139
name because they have carbon and

172
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,330
hydrogen in them and they're pretty much

173
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:01,629
all flammable and we as humans burn them

174
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:03,610
so the simplest possible one is a gas

175
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,270
called methane also known as swamp gas

176
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,949
if you can't tell that's a small and

177
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,750
methane is flammable and if I light it

178
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,930
on fire it reacts with oxygen in the

179
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,180
atmosphere and it produces co2 that goes

180
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,280
back into the atmosphere and it also

181
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,819
produces water vapor that goes into the

182
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,729
atmosphere

183
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:23,889
or if I take a slightly more complicated

184
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,090
hydrocarbon propane so it's more

185
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,500
complicated because it's got more

186
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,960
carbons in it so c3h8 propane as is the

187
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,460
gas you might use in your barbecue but

188
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,460
when you burn it you react it with

189
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,129
oxygen in the atmosphere which then adds

190
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,069
co2 back to the atmosphere and also adds

191
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:44,440
water vapor to the atmosphere or it can

192
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:47,680
get more complicated and get a molecule

193
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,930
called butane butane as c4h10 this is

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,930
what they put in lighters you react it

195
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,729
with oxygen produces co2 and produces

196
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,000
water so on each one of these examples

197
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:01,509
as we burn this fossil fuel we're adding

198
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,090
water to the atmosphere more and more

199
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:07,360
complicated hard hydrocarbons not only

200
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,370
become more complicated molecules but

201
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,900
you can get mixtures of things so for

202
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,150
example gasoline is a mixture of

203
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,229
different kinds of hydrocarbons coal is

204
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,340
a mixture of different kinds of

205
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:19,750
hydrocarbons so one example of this is

206
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,550
when you start your car on a cold

207
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,370
morning and you see this bit well it

208
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:27,460
looks like a big white cloud coming out

209
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,529
of your tailpipe in fact is a cloud it's

210
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,969
water that's coming from the burning of

211
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:33,159
hydrocarbons so there's water vapor

212
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,620
coming out of your exhaust pipe it gets

213
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,110
cooled to the dew point and condensation

214
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,729
occurs and the other thing you might

215
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,990
notice on a cold morning when you're

216
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,880
sitting in traffic and you're behind

217
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,740
somebody else is you'll see water

218
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,890
actually dripping out of the tailpipe

219
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,100
and that's water that's from burning of

220
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,540
hydrocarbons burning the gasoline it

221
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,440
reaches the dew point somewhere inside

222
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,730
the tailpipe

223
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,550
because it hasn't warmed up enough yet

224
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:00,820
and drips out and you can see it running

225
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,720
out of the tailpipe another example is

226
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,040
if you see a coal-fired power plant so

227
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,020
this is one this is the Navajo

228
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,390
Generating Station in Arizona and so the

229
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,020
burning coal and on the cold morning you

230
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,390
will see a big plume of white coming out

231
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:20,440
of the smokestacks and that's all water

232
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:22,360
as you burn coal it produces water like

233
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,610
we've been saying the water vapor comes

234
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,500
up into the atmosphere chills of the dew

235
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:31,240
point and you're making a cloud in the

236
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:36,100
cloud eventually evaporates another

237
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,960
example is with planes and a plane will

238
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,930
often leave what's called a condensation

239
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,450
trail so this plane this jet engines got

240
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,390
four of them each jet engine is burning

241
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,940
hydrocarbons and as a result is

242
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,410
producing water water vapor comes out

243
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,480
and at first it's hot and you see

244
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,850
there's no cloud right here there's a

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,220
gap and then eventually it gets cooled

246
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,720
to it's dew point and you get a cloud

247
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,310
and there's four clouds for the four

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,950
engines so condensation trails whether

249
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,600
you might notice that some days

250
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:10,480
condensation trails are very obvious and

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,790
they stay up in the sky a long time in

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,140
some days if you look carefully there

253
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,820
are planes that actually don't have any

254
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,460
condensation trails at all or they're

255
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,650
very short and that's all dependent on

256
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,010
what the relative humidity up here is

257
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,630
the higher the relative humidity the the

258
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,540
easier it is for a jet to make a

259
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,760
condensation trail so here's some

260
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,290
condensation trails and on this day it

261
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,480
looks like the relative humidity is

262
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,310
pretty high because one of the things

263
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,380
that can happen is that condensation

264
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,900
trail can actually start to nucleate

265
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,390
into clouds so this one is starting to

266
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,700
turn into cirrocumulus right this one's

267
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,440
starting to turn into cirrocumulus down

268
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,830
here looks like some of these are

269
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,530
starting to turn into cirrus so remember

270
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:56,020
clouds really high clouds are typically

271
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,730
all ice crystals and so one of the

272
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,280
things that condensation trails from

273
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,860
jets can do is they can basically make

274
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,230
artificial clouds they'll make a little

275
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,820
band tiny narrow bands of Cirrus or tiny

276
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,010
bands of cirrocumulus

277
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,950
here's a very interesting satellite

278
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,840
photo taken one morning where the

279
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,250
relative humidity was pretty high on

280
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,810
that morning and you see all these

281
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,420
streaks all these little white streaks

282
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:24,910
all over those are all condensation

283
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:27,130
trails from jets so what we're working

284
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,410
up towards is we've got some little

285
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,470
puffy clouds here and what we want to do

286
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:35,350
is understand why is it that this cloud

287
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,810
forms right there and ends right there

288
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,090
and why is there cloud here and not a

289
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,070
cloud there that's what we're working up

290
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,640
towards but what we're going to do first

291
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:49,450
is get into a little bit about

292
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,880
properties of error so we're going to

293
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,400
spend a couple minutes looking at the

294
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,860
properties of air and I've got a

295
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,470
simulation from Phet called gas

296
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,530
properties and what I've got is a big

297
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,210
empty box here where all of the air has

298
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,740
been removed from the box we just have

299
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,880
two gas molecules so this might be say

300
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,850
nitrogen and oxygen would you've got one

301
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:17,620
of each and what I want you to notice is

302
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:20,770
that notice the behavior of of these air

303
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,600
molecules inside this box they move in a

304
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,240
perfectly straight line until they hit

305
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,770
something and then they reflect off so

306
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,380
if we can imagine taking all the air out

307
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,320
of a room and when we release say two

308
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,210
two molecules and oxygen and nitrogen

309
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,370
what we would notice is that they were

310
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,750
flying out in at room temperature

311
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,060
perhaps a couple hundred miles an hour

312
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,310
if they go flying out and start bouncing

313
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:47,020
off the walls and the objects in the

314
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:50,110
room now realistically of course there

315
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,420
is way more than just two air molecules

316
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,050
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna add

317
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,970
a bunch more molecules to this box so

318
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:05,230
I'm gonna add some small ones and then

319
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:09,310
add some big ones and what I want you to

320
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,740
notice is that in addition to bouncing

321
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,410
off the walls they're actually more

322
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,750
bouncing off each other now and this is

323
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:20,040
more realistic to how air actually works

324
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:22,350
if I had one individual oxygen one

325
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,910
Vigil nitrogen even though it wants to

326
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,920
move in a perfectly straight line till

327
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,300
hit something what it actually does is

328
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,040
it moves in a perfectly straight line

329
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,170
until it hits one of its neighbors and

330
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,399
then reflects off its neighbor and then

331
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,709
it moves in a perfectly straight line

332
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
again until hits another neighbor and as

333
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,709
it's moving these little straight lines

334
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,269
it might be going several hundred miles

335
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,940
an hour and each one of these other

336
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:44,610
movements but over time it takes a

337
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,380
really long time for it to actually get

338
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,899
across the room because it has to

339
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,670
balance against all of its neighbors but

340
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:54,060
that's how to imagine air that's how to

341
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,370
imagine how air behaves imagine a room

342
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,339
full of ping-pong balls just flying

343
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,350
around the room bouncing into everything

344
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:05,399
okay so now imagine that you are this

345
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,230
little guy here and you are pushing this

346
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,769
is a wall that can move slides back and

347
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:14,339
forth okay and he's got to push on that

348
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:16,680
wall because these air molecules on the

349
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:20,329
other side are pushing back at him right

350
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:24,360
and so for every square inch of surface

351
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:26,160
every object everywhere on earth there

352
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,209
are air molecules that are coming down

353
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,670
and hitting that that object so on this

354
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:35,160
you can see them they're bouncing up you

355
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,589
know bouncing against the wall several

356
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,440
times a second in real life maybe they

357
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,449
may be hitting every surface millions of

358
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,100
times a second and that produces a

359
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,040
pressure and that pressure is will be

360
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,779
called air pressure so in this

361
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,720
particular simulation there's a gauge

362
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:54,000
here of air pressure and then using a

363
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,180
unit it says ATM and that's called

364
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,380
atmospheres so in this little simulation

365
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,850
one atmosphere just to put in

366
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,610
perspective is how much air pressure you

367
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,930
would feel at sea level on earth okay so

368
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,220
it doesn't really matter the exact

369
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,260
numbers or anything doesn't matter and

370
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,730
the temperature in this case is Kelvin

371
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,769
and again the exact number doesn't

372
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,630
matter what matters is we're going to

373
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,180
make a few adjustments I want you to

374
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:18,149
look at how these two things change so

375
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,009
our little guy here can push against

376
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,569
this wall so I'm gonna make I'm gonna

377
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,630
push the wall in and make the Box

378
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:26,730
smaller and so I what I want you to do

379
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:30,600
is keep an eye on those two things so

380
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,579
here we go so I'm gonna push and as I

381
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,329
push notice what the temperature is

382
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,160
doing

383
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,639
and notice what the pressure is doing

384
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,790
okay so the pressure has gone up and the

385
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,649
temperature has gone up and also the air

386
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,379
molecules are moving much faster than

387
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,879
they were before and we've said this in

388
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:51,540
earlier lecture that temperature is a

389
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:54,059
measure of the average speed of a gas so

390
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,569
in the atmosphere if as we make it

391
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:58,619
warmer

392
00:15:54,569 --> 00:16:02,910
all objects start to move faster so I'm

393
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:05,759
going to make open up the box and notice

394
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:09,600
the pressure goes down temperature goes

395
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,239
down and the molecules are going slower

396
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,540
and slower and slower okay so this is

397
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:19,110
one of the big properties of gases if I

398
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,139
have a closed box or think maybe more

399
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:25,920
like a balloon of air and I compress

400
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:28,529
this air right if I compress the air the

401
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,579
air gets warmer and the pressure goes up

402
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:37,230
and if I expand my box or expand my

403
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:41,850
balloon then the pressure goes down and

404
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:44,549
the temperature goes down so there's one

405
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,040
more thing I can demonstrate here and so

406
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:49,350
far the behavior of the gases in this

407
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,980
box is what you would get if there was

408
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,949
no gravity and what this simulation

409
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,389
allows you to do is add gravity so what

410
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:59,309
I want you to do is imagine that this

411
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:01,589
box now represents the Earth's

412
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,239
atmosphere okay so this entire box is

413
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:06,059
all of the air in the Earth's atmosphere

414
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:08,579
and Earth is down here and what I'm

415
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:11,039
going to do is turn on gravity and I

416
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:16,010
want you to watch what happens to the

417
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,010
air molecules in this box so here we go

418
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:27,199
now notice first thing you can notice is

419
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:29,820
that the denser blue gas molecules are

420
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,100
concentrated towards the bottom but

421
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,470
actually and it's hard to see this with

422
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,340
the red but all the gases are actually

423
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,740
concentrated more towards the bottom so

424
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,450
this is the way to visualize air in the

425
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,820
Earth's atmosphere because earth has

426
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,340
gravity gravity is trying to pull all

427
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,620
the gas down to the surface

428
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,420
and the only reason that all the gases

429
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,430
aren't just laying on the ground is

430
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,700
because they have enough kinetic energy

431
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,550
that they balance against each other and

432
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,950
continue to stay in the atmosphere if

433
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,380
earth earth had a stronger gravitational

434
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,770
field it would be able to compress the

435
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,560
gas closer to the surface so what this

436
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:14,670
means is if you were to say get into a

437
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:17,190
balloon anywhere to rise up into Earth's

438
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,890
atmosphere there would be fewer and

439
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,710
fewer gas molecules banging against the

440
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,080
surface of the balloon because most of

441
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,640
the gas is concentrated near the surface

442
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,920
near the ground and so on earth what we

443
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,470
know is that air pressure is highest at

444
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,690
sea level and as you go up and up and up

445
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,940
as humans it gets harder and harder to

446
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,970
breathe right so in Albuquerque were

447
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,430
mile above sea level a mile above us

448
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,460
here are about the top of Sandia Crest

449
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,260
and up there you know a lot of people

450
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,850
have trouble breathing by the time you

451
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,670
get up to say Mount Everest you're

452
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:55,200
30,000 feet almost nobody can breathe

453
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:56,970
and so air pressure decreases with

454
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,310
height decreases with height above the

455
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,800
ground and this is why because Earth's

456
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:05,370
gravity is trying to pull the gas down

457
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,080
towards the surface so when we talk

458
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,420
about things convecting in the

459
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,900
atmosphere we use this term called air

460
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:16,230
parcel and an air parcel is just a blob

461
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,260
of air you can't see it but when you

462
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,430
hear that term just think of a balloon

463
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:25,410
so here I've just got a normal little

464
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:27,180
balloon and as we just learned air

465
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,740
pressure you think air pressure is being

466
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,930
the result of all those little air

467
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,570
molecules banging against the side of

468
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:36,300
any surface including the outside of

469
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:38,310
this balloon now there's also air on the

470
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,750
inside of the balloon and there's air

471
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,820
pressure on the inside and that

472
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,280
molecules on the inside of the balloon

473
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,290
are also banging on the sides trying to

474
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,800
get out and it turns out those two

475
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:53,460
forces are balanced so my balloon does

476
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,230
not change size right so this the force

477
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,600
is pushing in and the force is pushing

478
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,120
out from from inside are exactly

479
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,400
balanced

480
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,170
when we talk about air parcels in the

481
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,060
atmosphere moving up and down I want you

482
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:08,810
to visualize a balloon just like this

483
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,640
that's moving up and down so I'm gonna

484
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:14,180
put this balloon in this little chamber

485
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,980
here and what I'm gonna do is I'm going

486
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:21,020
to start pumping the air molecules out

487
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,910
from inside this chamber so in other

488
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,970
words the amount of air in the balloon

489
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:28,160
itself is not going to change the air

490
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,570
around the balloon is going to change

491
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,690
and this is going to simulate what

492
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,240
happens when a balloon or a parcel of

493
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,220
air rises up into the atmosphere as it

494
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,200
rises up into the atmosphere there's

495
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,300
less and less air molecules up there

496
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,940
that are banging on the sides of our

497
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,560
little balloon so they'll be so there's

498
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,150
less pressure up there so this is going

499
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,190
to simulate that I'm going to pump air

500
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,040
out of this chamber so this will look

501
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,870
tube you can't see if there's a pump off

502
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,430
the screen here so I want you to just

503
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,500
imagine there's air being sucked down

504
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,780
this tube and we'll see what the balloon

505
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,840
does so that again this is a simulation

506
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,830
of what would happen to air parcel as it

507
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,830
goes up into the atmosphere

508
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,909
okay so we are now pumping air out of

509
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,950
this balloon and I think you can see

510
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:25,520
that's getting ordered and I'll step out

511
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,520
of the way here

512
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:51,919
it's okay so I'm going to turn off the

513
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:55,039
pump so I don't think I need to convince

514
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,349
you that the balloon got bigger so this

515
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,299
is what you have to keep in mind which I

516
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,189
want you to imagine when we talk about

517
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:03,769
air parcels rising into the atmosphere

518
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:05,869
as they rise into the atmosphere there's

519
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,969
less air banging on the outside of the

520
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:10,129
of the sides of this balloon or the size

521
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:12,679
of an air parcel and the air parcel will

522
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:15,019
expand so anytime air rises from the

523
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,739
earth up up into the atmosphere it

524
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:22,639
expands and it gets larger now one of

525
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:26,419
the see what I'm going to do here is I

526
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:29,299
am now going to let air back in and so

527
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:31,099
we're gonna see so we would expect that

528
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:38,239
the moon should get smaller so let's see

529
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:40,159
if that's what happens now

530
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:43,219
in a face-to-face class or what I do at

531
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,929
this point is I pull this out and hand

532
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:48,409
it to somebody in the class and I ask

533
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:50,479
them tell me how it feels and they grab

534
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:52,609
it and they're like oh it's really warm

535
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:55,399
in fact the moon is pretty hot right now

536
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:57,799
and the reason for that is because I

537
00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:00,319
just took a balloon that was the size of

538
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,299
this and shrunk it down to the size of

539
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:06,079
this and as we saw in the earlier

540
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:10,729
segment when you compress air it gets

541
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:13,819
warmer the opposite is also true if you

542
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:15,379
expand air it gets cooler so even though

543
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:18,499
I can't really demonstrate it to you

544
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:21,499
here when we expanded that balloon up to

545
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:23,929
the size of the of this whole chamber it

546
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:27,439
was the air inside there was actually

547
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,929
cooler so put those two ideas together

548
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:32,509
if I have a parcel of air and it rises

549
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:35,929
into the atmosphere okay two things

550
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:38,869
happen it expands and because of expands

551
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:42,649
it cools on the other hand if I have a

552
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:46,849
parcel there and I'm bringing it down it

553
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:50,800
gets smaller and it gets warmer okay so

554
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:54,110
we keep those two laws in mind

555
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,660
so not only do we know that rising air

556
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,120
expands and cools in sinking air

557
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,800
compresses and worms but we can predict

558
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,410
exactly how much the temperature will

559
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,290
change turns out doesn't matter where

560
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,510
you are in the atmosphere rising air

561
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,760
will always cool at a rate of five point

562
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:14,180
four degrees for every thousand feet

563
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,830
that it rises or it will warm five point

564
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,900
four degrees for every thousand feet

565
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,570
that it sinks or in the metric system

566
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,780
the temperatures will change 9.8 degrees

567
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,180
Celsius for every one kilometer these

568
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,640
numbers are known as the lapse rates and

569
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:32,660
this particular number is called the dry

570
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,750
adiabatic lapse rate and dry means that

571
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,150
the relative humidity is less than 100%

572
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,430
meaning you're not in a cloud so these

573
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,260
numbers are valid for air moving up and

574
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,560
down the atmosphere as long as it's not

575
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:48,140
in a cloud adiabatic is a little bit

576
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,860
more hard to understand but if this is

577
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,420
my air parcel as it rises up or down in

578
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,980
the atmosphere remember it can change

579
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,540
his temperature it's going to expand or

580
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,580
it's going to compress and the

581
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,940
temperature is going to change adiabatic

582
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,280
means it's not absorbing any extra heat

583
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,770
from its neighbors or it's not emitting

584
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,390
any heat to to its neighbors in other

585
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,640
words 80 Bennett kind of means it's

586
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,260
insulated so we're talking about these

587
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,060
air parcels moving up and down the

588
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,950
atmosphere and we're going to pretend

589
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,630
that they're perfectly insulated from

590
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,830
their environment that's what we mean by

591
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:24,470
adiabatic okay so for this next part I'm

592
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:26,330
going to use a handout that I have put

593
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,040
up on learn from my current students and

594
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,290
if you're from somewhere else on the

595
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,790
internet it's on my web page and you

596
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,560
might want to print this out so you can

597
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,690
kind of follow along with what we're

598
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,870
going to do it's two-sided and we're

599
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:40,580
going to start with day one so the

600
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,480
premise of this is that we've got a

601
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,830
mountain up here in the atmosphere and

602
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,930
we've sent a weather balloon up and the

603
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,840
weather balloon has measured the

604
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,490
temperatures every thousand feet so we

605
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,120
know that the conditions of the air

606
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,820
above our heads now we'll talk more

607
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,920
about this in a future lecture but when

608
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,509
you have a mountain that's sticking up

609
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,549
in the atmosphere

610
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:08,690
the surface of the mountain will warm

611
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:11,690
faster than the air okay so we've got

612
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,190
three locations here where we know the

613
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,019
conditions at the surface the

614
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,149
temperatures and the dew point of the

615
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,789
air at the surface of the mountain and

616
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:22,849
the question is will the air at those

617
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:28,369
three locations rise and if it does rise

618
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:32,119
will it eventually form a cloud so what

619
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:38,409
I'm gonna do here is start with the one

620
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:38,409
on the right and get a calculator so

621
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:46,190
here we know that the the temperature is

622
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:48,919
85 degrees the dew point is 55 degrees

623
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,949
and the question is is this air going to

624
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,219
rise and I check the conditions of the

625
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:58,249
air right next to it which is 84 85 is

626
00:26:55,219 --> 00:27:00,499
greater than 84 and air wants to rise

627
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:04,159
now you've heard the term warm air rises

628
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:07,279
that is true sort of if I have a blanket

629
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,879
a continuous blanket of warm air it will

630
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,159
not rise because any parcel within that

631
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,049
blanket is the same temperature as its

632
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,899
surrounding neighbors and it doesn't

633
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:19,729
rise but if I have a little plume of

634
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:23,209
warm air that's warmer than the air

635
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:26,629
around it then it does want to rise okay

636
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:28,459
so in this case 85 warmer than 84 it's

637
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:32,839
going to rise so what I'm gonna do is

638
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:34,879
I'm gonna draw some arrows to represent

639
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:38,299
this air rising okay

640
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:41,329
now question is when it gets a thousand

641
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:43,309
feet above the ground so as it rise as

642
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:46,039
it rises it expands and it cools

643
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,440
what is its temperature up here well

644
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,089
from the dry adiabatic lapse rate I know

645
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,069
it's going to cool five point four

646
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:54,019
degrees Fahrenheit for every thousand

647
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:55,879
feet and in these exercises we're

648
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:58,999
sticking with Fahrenheit and feet

649
00:27:55,879 --> 00:28:01,519
because America that's why so I'm going

650
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:04,719
to take 85 and I'm going to subtract

651
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,339
five point four and i get seventy nine

652
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:09,829
point six i'm gonna draw it right on the

653
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:12,769
line because this line the temperature

654
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:16,059
right on that line is 78 so i compare is

655
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:19,520
this warmer than 78 yes it is so

656
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:22,010
continue rising so then I draw more

657
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,049
arrows and I want to know okay what

658
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,640
would its temperature be if it got up to

659
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,070
this height second let's subtract

660
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,220
another five point four and I get

661
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:33,190
seventy four point two and I look and I

662
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,240
compare is it still going to rise

663
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,880
seventy four point two warmer than

664
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,980
seventy two yes so it's going to

665
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,440
continue to rise as subtract another

666
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:46,970
five point four and I get the sixty

667
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:49,100
eight point eight now warmer than the

668
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,990
air around it here warmer than the air

669
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,110
around it here warmer than the air

670
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:57,140
around it here but here sixty eight

671
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,270
point eight is cooler than seventy so

672
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,400
what we know is that our parcel of air

673
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,559
will rise and expand and cool and rise

674
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,990
and expand and cool but stays warmer

675
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,690
than the air around it until it gets to

676
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:13,910
this point that means somewhere between

677
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:16,130
here and here our rising air stops so we

678
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,799
don't know exactly where so in this

679
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,260
class for convention let's just draw in

680
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,860
the middle so in the middle this close

681
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:30,620
this air right turns and starts to sink

682
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:32,929
back down like this so it doesn't get

683
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,970
this high right we know what passes this

684
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,799
point doesn't get to this point stop

685
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,799
somewhere in the middle this loop that

686
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:43,820
we made is called a convection current a

687
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:47,020
or convection cell and it goes has

688
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:53,450
another popular name called a thermal

689
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:55,880
and thermals are outside right now every

690
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,770
day as long as the Sun is up so what

691
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,040
happens is the Sun comes up in the

692
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,870
morning and the surface starts to warm

693
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,280
and depending on what the surface is

694
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,340
made out of it warms to slightly

695
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,900
different temperatures and little poems

696
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,850
the warm air start to rise you can't

697
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:14,780
ever see it but it's happening every day

698
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:18,530
now what will happen is early in the

699
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,090
morning the the thermals rise maybe just

700
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,870
a few feet and then they sink back down

701
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:26,750
by late afternoon they may go up several

702
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:29,360
miles before they come back down now

703
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:32,570
birds know all about this

704
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,540
and a big bird with a big wingspan it

705
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:38,150
takes a lot of energy for it to flap its

706
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,700
wings for active flight so what they'll

707
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,680
do is they will figure out where there's

708
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,230
a thermals right now we got this big guy

709
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,010
up here and he has found a plume of

710
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:51,830
rising warm air and so hit what he has

711
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,640
to do is if he stays within this plume

712
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,410
of warm air

713
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,420
he doesn't have to flap his wings

714
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,760
because he can just kind of ride use

715
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,760
that rising air his lifts and he can

716
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,830
stay up as long as he wants now one

717
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,440
thing that the bird has to take into

718
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,110
account though is in this case and the

719
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,720
one that we drew he can fly in here no

720
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,850
problem but the problem is for him is

721
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,790
that if he gets out here he's gonna get

722
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,680
sucked down this arm of the thermal and

723
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,810
of course he has a bird brain so he

724
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,640
doesn't know this so if you watch these

725
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,930
big birds but what will happen is that

726
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,730
they'll be flying around and flying

727
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,950
around and then they accidentally fly

728
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:30,710
into this part and suddenly you'll see

729
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:33,230
them discovery suddenly dive and it

730
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,640
looks like they're diving down I click

731
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,500
on the crashing of the ground but then

732
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,160
they'll figure out how to get back into

733
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:46,100
the thermal ok so let's do the next one

734
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:50,090
and the next one surface is 76

735
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,400
temperature up there 72 and the question

736
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,830
is is it going to rise 76 one with a 72

737
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,380
so yes it does so I'm going to draw some

738
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,850
arrows and the question is now okay

739
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,690
what's the temperature a thousand feet

740
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,280
above the ground

741
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:08,000
I take 76 and I subtract 5 point 4 and I

742
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,560
get 70 point 6 is that warmer than the

743
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,180
air that's up there so the number I'm

744
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,820
checking with is this one that's what

745
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,880
the weather blew and has measured yes

746
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,610
it's warmer just barely so let's do it

747
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,000
again another thousand feet subtracted

748
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:27,350
another five point four and I get sixty

749
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,850
five point two warmer yes it is keep

750
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:35,150
going fifty nine point eight warmer keep

751
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,820
going some drawing arrows this whole

752
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,940
time to show that the air is rising

753
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:44,200
subtract another five point four I get

754
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:48,110
fifty four point four

755
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:53,330
still warmer yes it is do it again

756
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:58,820
subtract another 5.4 49 now at this

757
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:00,500
point 49 is warmer than 48 so we know

758
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,480
it's going to rise but there's something

759
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,220
else that's going to happen because it

760
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:12,260
turns out the dew point was 49 so our

761
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,080
little air parcel that has been rising

762
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:19,870
and rising has finally cooled until it

763
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,870
hits the dew point so right here

764
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,590
temperature is now equal to the dew

765
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:30,650
point and what's the relative humidity

766
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,450
conditions when that happens relative

767
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:37,909
humidity is a hundred percent right

768
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:39,320
there and we get condensation starting

769
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:45,230
at this point and we're gonna start

770
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:47,960
building a cloud okay now before we go

771
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,150
to the next step realize now there's

772
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,950
actually another thing that's going on

773
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:56,000
and we talked about this in a previous

774
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:58,159
lecture where we said that when you hit

775
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,190
the dew point and you start making do

776
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,309
that the water molecules not only

777
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,080
collect into liquid droplets but they

778
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,149
bring in these little boxes of thermal

779
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,879
energy and they release them we call

780
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:13,220
that latent heat and the formation of do

781
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,669
we say that the time helps actually keep

782
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,409
the grass warm when it occurs well we're

783
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:20,090
now doing the same process but we're

784
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:22,669
doing it up in the sky and we're doing

785
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,840
it around those condensation nuclei so

786
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:28,850
as our water molecules are coming in to

787
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:32,300
grow a little cloud droplet they're

788
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:34,970
adding thermal energy to the cloud okay

789
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:38,869
so there's two competing processes then

790
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:41,300
as this air wants to rise it's going to

791
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:44,600
expand and cool right that's process

792
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,480
number one process number two is as we

793
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:51,859
condense water the water is adding

794
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,970
latent heat back to the air so so number

795
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:56,720
one cools it

796
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:59,990
number two warms it who wins well the

797
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,290
air-cooling still wins but what it means

798
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,820
is that our lapse rate is now different

799
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,250
instead of five point four degrees every

800
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,349
thousand feet it's two point seven and

801
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,700
it's actually varies on a bunch of

802
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,770
things but in this class we're just

803
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,460
gonna use the number of two point seven

804
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,500
and so this number two point seven has a

805
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,320
couple of different names sometimes the

806
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,810
wet adiabatic lapse rate or the

807
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,910
saturated lady abetik lapse rate or the

808
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,130
moist adiabatic lapse rate but all three

809
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,660
of these mean that relative humidity is

810
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,260
a hundred percent and you have a cloud

811
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,270
okay so just to recap it's rising and

812
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,070
expanding which is cooling but the

813
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:40,130
latent heat that's being added is

814
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:41,990
warming so the net result is it's still

815
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,970
cooling but not cooling as much as it

816
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,730
was before

817
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:48,980
okay so let's return to our cloud here

818
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:51,710
so from now on because I'm inside a

819
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,710
cloud I'm going to subtract two point

820
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:58,250
seven instead of five point four so 49

821
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:01,730
minus two point seven is forty six point

822
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:04,490
three okay is it warmer than the

823
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,800
surrounding air yes just a little bit so

824
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,930
I'm gonna draw my arrows to show the air

825
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,730
rising inside the cloud because that's

826
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,339
what happens so we're gonna go up

827
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,160
another thousand feet subtract another

828
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:20,510
two point seven I get forty three point

829
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,609
six so my cloud is growing and we're

830
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,970
making a little chemo form cloud like

831
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:27,589
maybe a cumulus okay

832
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:32,390
forty three point six warmer than forty

833
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:34,730
three so I keep going and I try another

834
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:39,619
thousand feet so I subtract another two

835
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:43,190
point seven forty point nine okay forty

836
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:44,720
point nine is cold in the forty to forty

837
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,690
three point six is warmer than forty

838
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,140
three so we know that it gets past this

839
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:52,520
line but does not get to this line so

840
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,369
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna draw my

841
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,740
cloud kind of like this I know I'm

842
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:59,359
trying to show that it gets somewhere

843
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,359
between those two I'm just going to draw

844
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,220
it halfway well where does the air go

845
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:09,620
where the air exits out the top of the

846
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:14,360
cloud and it goes back down

847
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:18,770
Hey so our convection cell is the same

848
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:21,560
thing as the thermal it's just that this

849
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,540
one cooled enough that it reached the

850
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,460
dew point and so it started to build a

851
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,010
cloud and so what we're doing is we're

852
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,530
just testing every thousand feet and we

853
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,510
can figure out we know where the bottom

854
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,120
of the cloud is and we know where the

855
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,490
top of the cloud is the other thing this

856
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,940
means is that you actively have to have

857
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:43,760
air moving into a cloud to keep that

858
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:46,160
cloud alive I'll talk more about that in

859
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,700
a little bit so on this worksheet there

860
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,030
are three points on the on the front on

861
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,820
day one and then on the back there are

862
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:58,970
three more points for day two so I'm

863
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,770
going to stop right now with this and

864
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,770
I'm gonna make a separate video where I

865
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:06,680
work out all of the points on both day

866
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,970
and one day one in two if you're having

867
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,570
trouble understanding what's happening

868
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,570
here

869
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,320
okay so let's return to the initial

870
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,470
question which is why do we have clouds

871
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,450
in certain locations and not others why

872
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,790
is the bottom of this cloud here why is

873
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,170
the top of this cloud here so we can

874
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,360
answer some of these questions now and

875
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,940
if I look at on this landscape I can see

876
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,560
that there's different elevations and

877
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,270
there's different types of vegetation so

878
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,810
we've got bushes and trees and grass and

879
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,510
whatnot

880
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,610
and so as the Sun comes out it warms

881
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,290
this all these different materials to

882
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:41,990
slightly different temperatures and the

883
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,970
locations that are warmer are sending up

884
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,160
thermals sending up plumes of warm air

885
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:48,380
and some of those plumes of warm air

886
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,900
sink back down without making a cloud

887
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,450
but everywhere where you see a cloud you

888
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:56,930
have to imagine that there's a plume of

889
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,640
warm air that has risen up to a certain

890
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:01,940
point where the temperature is equal to

891
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,890
dew point and then from that point

892
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,530
forward you will have made a cloud and

893
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,980
it continues to rise inside the cloud if

894
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:12,220
we annotate the whole thing here so air

895
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,830
is heated at the surface rising air

896
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:18,560
expands expanding air cools it's the dew

897
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:21,170
point air saturated you have a hundred

898
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,120
percent relative humidity air continues

899
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,250
to rise inside the cloud until it is

900
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,010
no longer warmer than the air around it

901
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:30,260
it exits out the cloud sinks back down

902
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:34,070
okay so that's happening under each one

903
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:35,530
of these little cumulus clouds now

904
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,570
there's a couple of words to describe

905
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:41,060
these conditions if we say we have

906
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,910
stable air what that means is that if I

907
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,670
try to make air rise it sinks back down

908
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,770
to its initial position also if I push

909
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,670
air down it wants to pop back up to its

910
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:54,020
initial position if you have stable air

911
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,000
and this is a term you'll hear and maybe

912
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,160
in a weather report sometime if you have

913
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,800
stable air that means that the skies

914
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,560
will probably be cloudless or you might

915
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,260
have some little tiny cumulus clouds the

916
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,550
opposite of that is unstable air so if

917
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,320
we have unstable air in the weather

918
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:12,080
report what that means is that if the

919
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,600
air rises it's going to continue to rise

920
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,750
which means it will probably likely hit

921
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,820
the dew point and make a cloud so when

922
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,260
we have days of unstable air we often

923
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,300
get talked humorous clause or

924
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,480
cumulonimbus clouds and we'll talk more

925
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,910
about this in the next lecture so to

926
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,130
summarize what we've done today a cloud

927
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,630
is just air that has been cooled to the

928
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,400
dew point so if it happens at the

929
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,860
surface we get dew on the grass if it

930
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,810
happens up in the sky we get a cloud the

931
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,570
surface is that the water molecules

932
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:45,770
collect - are called condensation nuclei

933
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:47,510
mostly just dust the gravity of the

934
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:50,690
earth wants to hold all the air to the

935
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,250
surface but it can't so what happens is

936
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,900
it holds most of the air towards the

937
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,280
surface which means that the air

938
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,520
pressure is greater towards the surface

939
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,010
and decreases as you go up so therefore

940
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,290
if you have a air parcel and it goes up

941
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:06,980
it feels less and less air pressure it

942
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:08,330
expands expanding air cools every day

943
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,310
when the Sun comes out you get these

944
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:13,250
rising booms of warm air that are rising

945
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:15,320
expanding and cooling and if they go

946
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,630
high enough they may cool to the dew

947
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,300
point and that will get you cumuliform

948
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,070
clouds so in the next lecture we'll talk

949
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,780
about what happens if this process

950
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:28,690
continues and the clouds continue to

951
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,690
grow I'm no strong thanks for watching

952
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,760
