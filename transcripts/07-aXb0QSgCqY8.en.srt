1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,380
so in this video we're going to continue

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,130
looking at the worksheet that we started

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,960
in the lecture on convection and so I

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,120
did two locations in the lecture we did

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,609
this one here and this turns out to be a

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,680
little thermal with no cloud then we did

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,470
this one which turns out to have a cloud

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,400
that starts at 8,000 feet and stop

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,920
somewhere between ten and eleven

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,500
thousand feet and so what I'm gonna do

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,980
next is this one over here

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,120
so I'll look at the temperature 64 I

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,300
compare it to the air that's already up

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,950
there which is 53 so first thing to keep

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,079
in mind remember what we're comparing

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,969
this to what's the temperature of the

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,290
air already up there don't confuse

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,879
yourself with these numbers that you

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,950
already put up there you're going back

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,739
to what the air what the temp air

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,960
temperatures are all right so I got 64

22
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:58,859
it's 53 it's gonna rise and so what I'm

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719
gonna do is take 64 and I'm gonna

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,019
subtract the dry adiabatic lapse rate

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:10,200
which is five point four I get fifty

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:13,920
eight point six and then I compare over

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,790
here it's once warmer than 48 so we're

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
gonna keep on going

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,270
sounds subtract another five point four

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,360
which is fifty three point two and

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,450
that's warmer than 46 subtract another

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,530
five point four that's forty seven point

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,939
eight which is warmer than forty three

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,939
so I'm gonna keep going

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:43,560
and I get forty two point four which is

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,159
one more than forty two so it's gonna

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,780
keep on going and so I'm just testing

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:55,130
every thousand feet subtract another

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:59,369
five point four and I get 37 now 37

40
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:02,040
warmer than 36 but you've got to keep

41
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,630
track of what's happening because that's

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,649
also the dew point so as you're doing

43
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,149
this keep checking to see that you you

44
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,760
know you want to make sure you you

45
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,770
realize it if you hit the dew point okay

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,870
so as you do these calculations

47
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,690
keep checking down and saying okay my

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:23,090
dewpoints 37 do I hit 37 right there I

49
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,090
do so at this point

50
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:34,800
okay so right there the temperature is

51
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,470
equal to the dew point therefore we know

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,840
that the relative humidity is a hundred

53
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:45,210
percent all right so now remember what

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,490
we said once you are so we're this is

55
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,850
the beginning of the cloud once you have

56
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,890
a cloud then you are instead of

57
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,900
subtracting five point four you're

58
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,400
subtracting in this class two point

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,430
seven and the reason for that is because

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,020
the addition of latent heat helps keep

61
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,480
the atmosphere warmer than it normally

62
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,480
would be alright so I've got my thirty

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,330
seven and then subtract this time two

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,500
point seven and that gets me thirty four

65
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:18,260
point three still warmer there then the

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,600
surrounding air so it's gonna rise and

67
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,000
continue to rise a cloud continues to

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,030
grow

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,900
okay subtract two point seven thirty one

70
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:34,110
point six okay that's warmer than thirty

71
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:38,070
so it continues to grow cloud continues

72
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:42,780
to grow and subtract two point seven

73
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:48,060
again I get twenty eight point nine okay

74
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,560
now notice here that 31.6 war were the

75
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,310
thirty one twenty eight point nine

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,900
almost but not quite twenty nine so what

77
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,560
that tells us is that the cloud will

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,540
rise past this point and almost but not

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,270
quite get to this point so I want to

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,940
draw it to show that it's between those

81
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,820
two lines like that and then where does

82
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,709
the air go well it comes out the top and

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:15,690
sinks back down so I'm gonna draw a few

84
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:18,270
arrows to show that okay all right so

85
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,130
now let's go to date two so on the

86
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:24,120
handouts probably on the other side or

87
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,389
the second page and so the set up here

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,509
is actually the bottom part is almost

89
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,979
same okay so the conditions down here

90
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,300
are the same and in fact temperatures

91
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,789
down here are the same the only thing

92
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,849
that's changed is we've brought in some

93
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:41,069
colder air aloft so we've got cold air

94
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,810
that's coming down from the north we're

95
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:46,050
gonna see how that changes things so the

96
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:52,580
first thing I'm gonna do is we're gonna

97
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:55,949
do this location right here so I've got

98
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:02,840
85 greater than 84 so I know it's gonna

99
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:06,930
rise subtract 5.4 seventy nine point six

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:12,680
seventy four point two I'm just

101
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:16,229
subtracting five point four each time

102
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,599
okay so warmer than the air around it

103
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:21,360
rises warmer than air around it rises

104
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:23,520
warmer than air rises not warmer than

105
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,490
air around it so somewhere between here

106
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:32,520
and here that air stops rising and then

107
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,439
sinks back down okay and this is exactly

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,150
what we got on day one so this is

109
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,139
exactly the same answer nothing's

110
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,680
changed here no cloud okay why is there

111
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,139
no cloud

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,370
we didn't cool it to the dewpoint all

113
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,610
right so let's go to this second one

114
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,610
here

115
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:56,939
okay so 76 minus five point four seventy

116
00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:00,360
point six five point four sixty five

117
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:03,810
point two five point four fifty nine

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:09,419
point eight and so I'm just subtracting

119
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,969
five point four here and I'm checking as

120
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:17,819
I go along to make sure that I'm warmer

121
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:20,969
than the air around it which I am now

122
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,810
here forty nine we've hit the dew point

123
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:24,930
okay

124
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,779
so right there temperature so you go to

125
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:31,250
the dew point and the relative humidity

126
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:35,310
is a hundred percent okay that's the

127
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:38,610
that one right there is that is the flat

128
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:41,479
bottom of our cloud which then is going

129
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,789
to start growing vertically

130
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:49,770
okay so now remember I'm going to

131
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:52,860
subtract 2.7 from now on because now I'm

132
00:06:49,770 --> 00:07:00,030
inside a cloud two point seven forty six

133
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:06,389
point three forty three point six forty

134
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:07,919
point 938 point two so let me see warmer

135
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,750
than the air around it warmer than the

136
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,490
air around it warmer warmer

137
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,530
so our cloud continues to grow so I'm

138
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:29,580
gonna keep drawing here thirty five

139
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:32,430
point five thirty two point eight thirty

140
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,320
point one okay so what we're seeing here

141
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,680
is that the cloud is growing growing

142
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,110
growing growing the air is continuing to

143
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,610
rise so this is what our cloud is doing

144
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,979
roll grow grow I didn't draw it very

145
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,840
straight my cloud is leaning a little

146
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,840
bit but that's because it's hard to use

147
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,849
this whole projector and not be crooked

148
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:57,750
so here we are at thirty point one and

149
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:59,580
still warmer than the air around it so

150
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,680
subtract two point seven again I get

151
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,080
twenty seven point four still warmer

152
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,949
than air around it so the cloud just

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,300
keeps on going

154
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:12,750
off the page okay so the point to this

155
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,880
is that this cloud starts in the same

156
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,159
place that it does on day one but

157
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,770
because we've got extra cold air up here

158
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,110
it helps the cloud grow and grow and

159
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,009
grow and grow and grow

160
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:34,169
alright we'll do the last one here okay

161
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:39,140
so 64 warmer than 53 so I think 64 point

162
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:42,930
is five point four fifty eight point six

163
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:48,000
that's five point four fifty three point

164
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:52,320
two minus five point four forty seven

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,970
point eight minus five point four

166
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,530
42.4 okay now let's just see what we're

167
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,760
doing here

168
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:04,570
warmer warmer warmer warmer so air is

169
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,310
rising have we hit the dew point we

170
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,390
gotta get down to 37 for the dew point

171
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,740
we haven't got there yet

172
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:15,660
subtract 5.4 37 okay so there we hit the

173
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:21,250
dew point so right there

174
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:25,570
oops off screen here temperature is

175
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:28,810
equal to the dew point relative humidity

176
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:33,130
is 100% we get the formation the

177
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,810
beginning of our cloud so then from from

178
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,710
this point forward remember I subtract

179
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:42,270
two point seven so two point seven is

180
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,400
thirty four point three two point seven

181
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:49,260
thirty one point six so again I'm

182
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:54,810
checking warmer warmer warmer

183
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,810
so my cloud is growing and growing

184
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:04,090
alright so then let's subtract two point

185
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:07,630
seven twenty eight point nine two point

186
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:11,710
seven twenty six point two and just like

187
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:14,050
the other cloud as we go up here we can

188
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,930
see that the temperatures continue to

189
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:20,110
stay warmer than the surrounding air so

190
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:26,680
this one like the other one grows off

191
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:29,410
the page okay so the point two doing all

192
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,590
this was to illustrate that if you want

193
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,280
air to rise to make a cloud the hotter

194
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:38,080
the air is near the surface the easier

195
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,940
it will rise through the atmosphere

196
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,270
right it's like it's got a better start

197
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:47,160
the hotter it is but if you made the air

198
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:51,010
colder up here that also helps air rise

199
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,620
so we can make air rise really high if

200
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,570
we start out really hot or we can make

201
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,240
it rise really high if we make the air

202
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,590
above our heads really cold and so this

203
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,720
is what we're doing here and is causing

204
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,090
the clouds to grow and so what we'll do

205
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,990
in the next lecture is explain well then

206
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,850
what happens

207
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,430
when these clouds keep growing like what

208
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,390
ultimately happens to them okay all

209
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,390
right thanks
