1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,190
hey I'm Elle strong in this lecture is

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,619
on convective weather and convective

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,110
storms and it follows the previous

4
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,930
lecture I gave which was on convection

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,210
in the atmosphere so watch the

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,950
introductory lecture - convection in the

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,870
atmosphere first and then come back and

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,840
watch this and it will make more sense

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,010
but what we've said so far is that when

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,369
you look out you see a bunch of little

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,260
puffy clouds what we now know is that

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,260
underneath each one of these is a rising

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,750
plume of air and the reason the air

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,380
would want to rise is because if I look

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,450
out here I see a variety of vegetation

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,820
variety of textures a variety of terrain

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,060
and so the temperature temperatures out

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,809
here are not all the same so places

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,040
where it's warmer will want to rise

20
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,050
preferentially and so you get these

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,840
plumes of rising warm air that we call

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,510
thermals as they rise they expand as

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,760
they expand they cool and eventually

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,640
that air is cooled down to its dew point

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,110
and when that happens you get a

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,479
saturation of the air and the relative

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,250
humidity is a hundred percent from that

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,500
point forward you have a cloud and

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,180
whether or not the air continues to rise

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,299
just depends on whether or not it's

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,880
still warmer than the air around it so

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,650
this lecture basically focuses on the

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,890
question of what happens if this cloud

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,650
continues to grow but first let's talk

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,930
about some sources of heat so down here

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,920
the sources of heat are just simply the

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,180
the Sun but what you could have is you

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,590
could have something like maybe a fire

39
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,210
so we have a source of heat here and you

40
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,759
can see the smoke but then right here

41
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,360
something happens and above this point

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,610
you've got a cumulus cloud and this

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,580
cumulus cloud is a mixture now of cloud

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,759
and smoke this rising warm air expands

45
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:03,540
and cools hits the dew point right here

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,430
and you get a saturation so this is

47
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,729
called a pyrocumulus clouds that's a

48
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,649
cumulus cloud that forms over a fire now

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,370
it may seem weird that you can condense

50
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,060
water out of smoke but remember the air

51
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,160
already has

52
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,650
some water vapor in it and then a fire

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,270
actually adds water to the air whenever

54
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,890
you burn fuel whenever you burn

55
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,230
hydrocarbons we talked about this in the

56
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,440
previous lecture and adds water vapor to

57
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,410
the air so it's pretty common that you

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,569
get cumulus clouds forming over fires

59
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,940
here's another one you can see exactly

60
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,830
the point where temperature must equal

61
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,620
dew point right there we go from all

62
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:45,360
smoke below to smoke and a whiter cloud

63
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:48,060
above this is a kind of lousy video but

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,950
it's a time-lapse of a wildfire and it's

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,410
showing that you can see rising plumes

66
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,510
of smoke and warm air and you can see

67
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,060
the point where it where the air cools

68
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,830
until it hits the dew point temperature

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,120
it's the dew point and we get saturation

70
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,720
and we get clouds so you can see you

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,410
know the white is the pyrocumulus clouds

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,110
forming over the hot fire you can also

73
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,819
get them over volcanoes so you've got a

74
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,239
source of heat down here this black

75
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,010
material is what we call ash and ash our

76
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,470
tiny little fragments of rock and glass

77
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,239
that are coming out of the volcano but

78
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,700
right there you notice it changes and

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,660
you got this puffiness so this is ash

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,340
plus cloud and so as the air is rising

81
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,230
it's cooling and eventually the

82
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,230
temperature equals the dew point and you

83
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,489
get a cloud that's also growing in with

84
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,829
the ash coming out of the volcano

85
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:44,459
sometimes as humans we create clouds and

86
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:46,709
so this is an illustrate an example of

87
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,440
one such case think about all of the

88
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,180
things that we have blacktopped so big

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,850
parking lots airports we pave over large

90
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,400
areas with dark material and it gets

91
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,470
really hot so this is an example of an

92
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,470
Air Force Base in Florida so everyday

93
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,530
Sun comes up warms up the the blacktop

94
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,380
and that warm air starts to rise it then

95
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,260
condenses forms a cloud and that cloud

96
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,060
sits over the Air Force Base but the

97
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,340
wind blows it off to the side so you get

98
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,019
this kind of elongate cloud that goes

99
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,729
off into the distance so this is what it

100
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,370
looks like so we're standing at the Air

101
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:25,229
Force Base there's that cloud you can

102
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,940
see the winds blowing it off into the

103
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,949
distance so they basically have this

104
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,210
cloud that just sits there all day long

105
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:36,389
day after day after day another source

106
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:41,090
of heat our mountains and so to

107
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,090
illustrate this imagine that we have

108
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:46,439
mentally we don't have a mountain first

109
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,180
and we've got a flat terrain and as I go

110
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,590
up in the atmosphere I would notice that

111
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,270
the temperature gets cooler and cooler

112
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,969
and cooler and cooler with height okay

113
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,830
that's what you'd expect but now let's

114
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:57,830
imagine that we stick a mountain in this

115
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:06,779
okay so when the Sun comes out and warms

116
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:08,430
the earth we'll talk more about this in

117
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,169
a future lecture but for the most part

118
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,599
sunlight just travels right through the

119
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,150
atmosphere and doesn't affect it but it

120
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:18,180
impacts the the surface of things it

121
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,729
will warm them up so here you have this

122
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,590
surface sitting up in the air so right

123
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:26,669
here are the temperature up there is 40

124
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:30,029
degrees right here maybe when the Sun

125
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:32,370
comes up it warms it to 50 right and up

126
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:36,240
here with the temperatures 30 maybe the

127
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,490
Sun hits it and warms up to 40 so the

128
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,680
point is you've got this thing that's up

129
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,020
in the atmosphere that's warmer than the

130
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,770
atmosphere around it so what'll happen

131
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:50,580
is air will start to rise above the

132
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:54,120
mountain and if it rises enough then we

133
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,669
start to get condensation and a cloud

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,800
will form above the mountain so this is

135
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,870
what happens around here a lot so if you

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,789
live in Albuquerque a lot of times

137
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,639
you'll notice in the summer that will

138
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:10,050
get cumuliform clouds that start over

139
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,490
the Sandia's and in fact this is what it

140
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,310
would look like if you were to climb to

141
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,449
the top of a mountain and look up during

142
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,120
when this is happening

143
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,520
so right here where I'm standing looking

144
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,830
straight up there is warm air rising

145
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,819
above our heads going straight up and

146
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,589
then hitting the dew point you're

147
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,259
turning into a cumulus cause this is

148
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:31,289
what the bottom of a cumulus cloud looks

149
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,810
like right where the warm air rises off

150
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:36,930
the surface and so this cloud just kind

151
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,279
of sits to here for hours growing you

152
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,460
can see there's movement in here but the

153
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:44,400
cloud pretty much stays in one spot

154
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,220
here's another view of it so what we've

155
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,930
been saying so far is that you know

156
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,580
thermals you can't see thermals right

157
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,830
when the warm air rises from the surface

158
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,550
but this one the warm air is rising

159
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,690
right in front of us and so right here

160
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,590
you should be able to make out that the

161
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:04,380
warm air is rising right there and going

162
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,970
into that cloud so right there the

163
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,210
temperature equals dew point and you're

164
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:13,320
getting 100% relative humidity

165
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:15,840
saturation and a cloud so when you look

166
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,030
from space you can actually see this

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,140
effect really clearly and I've got a

168
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,450
satellite image here I'm at a website

169
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,580
called world view from NASA and right

170
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,280
now I'm looking down over here over New

171
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,190
Mexico you can go to this site if you

172
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,080
want if you do the date down here will

173
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,320
be the current date and you can change

174
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,570
it too so I'm looking at July 18 2017

175
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,400
just happen to be a day where this

176
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,770
happens but it but this is pretty common

177
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,800
well on the show here what you see is

178
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,580
you see that there are clouds in certain

179
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,520
areas and then not others right so these

180
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,650
areas that are kind of darker green are

181
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,450
higher elevation they're higher

182
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,480
elevation they get more precipitation

183
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:03,720
and therefore have more vegetation we'll

184
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,450
talk later on about why they have more

185
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,370
precipitation on mountains but they do

186
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,120
so for example here we got mountains we

187
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,680
get a valley

188
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,080
we got mountains and you can see that

189
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,810
the clouds are preferentially forming

190
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,620
over the mountains in fact we can go

191
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,780
down here and that gray blob right there

192
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,460
is Albuquerque okay so there's a

193
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,010
Sandhya's and you see this clouds over

194
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,950
the Sandia's you go a little bit to the

195
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:33,450
north as a side here you see this thing

196
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,640
so this is this fuzziness are ice

197
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,920
crystals coming off of a cumulonimbus

198
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,680
cloud so that's the anvil as seen from

199
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,540
above so this is the cumulonimbus this

200
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,910
is the the anvil that's spreading out

201
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,850
with all the ice in it in fact if I go

202
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,800
back down here so getting back down to

203
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,960
Albuquerque this one right here is

204
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,670
another one you can see but the

205
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,760
fuzziness of it and a lot of times what

206
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,460
will happen

207
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,880
is that the cumulonimbus will form over

208
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,670
the Sandia's and then move on and

209
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:06,340
continue to drift across the city this

210
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,650
time of day by the shadows I would

211
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,110
estimate it's probably a late morning

212
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,620
and so what we notice a lot of times in

213
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,250
the summer

214
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,630
is that the first clouds you'll see are

215
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,310
over the mountains and then once they

216
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,960
grow sometimes they'll drift off and go

217
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:24,340
somewhere else but they typically start

218
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:26,110
over the mountains a related idea is

219
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,470
what happens when you have land

220
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:33,010
surrounded by water so this is the

221
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,510
peninsula this is Florida right here and

222
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,730
so you get water on both sides of the

223
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,650
peninsula and you can see how many more

224
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,030
clouds are actually over the peninsula

225
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:45,280
than the water so we'll talk about this

226
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,050
in a future lecture but the ocean

227
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,830
doesn't change its temperature much

228
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,480
day-to-day and so the temperature in the

229
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,310
water here is pretty consistent day and

230
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,070
night whereas the temperatures on the on

231
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:00,550
the land vary quite a bit more between

232
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,860
day and night so during the day the land

233
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,930
heats up more than the water and you get

234
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:10,960
rising air and you get a whole bunch of

235
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:13,000
cumuliform clouds out of this so one of

236
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,790
the things that we are going to get into

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,460
here is try to figure out what happens

238
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,020
when a convection cell grows to

239
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,860
different heights and we have some terms

240
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,620
to describe how high they grow so the

241
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,020
same backwards but in weather when we

242
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,110
talk about how high a convection cell

243
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,450
grows we call that it's depth okay so if

244
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,340
I have shallow convection that means

245
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,250
that convective cells are not going very

246
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:43,360
high if I have deep convection that

247
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,470
means the cells are going much higher up

248
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,020
into the atmosphere

249
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,820
so shallow convection are days where we

250
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,920
might have no clouds at all the thermals

251
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,470
don't even get high enough to even make

252
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,900
a cloud or you get small cumulus clouds

253
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,000
deep convection you get these really

254
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,120
tall towering cumulus or maybe even

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,350
cumulonimbus so we're going to show you

256
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,210
some examples here so these are some

257
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,620
cumulus that are growing so we're over

258
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,590
the sandy as we get

259
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,480
a warm air rising off the mountain but

260
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,930
you'll notice that these cumulus don't

261
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,350
really grow very high right they're kind

262
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,080
of staying about this height and you

263
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,550
watch them they'll grow and they'll die

264
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,920
but they never get much taller than this

265
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,690
okay so that's pretty shallow convection

266
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,790
so the thermals are rising from the

267
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,330
surface and then they get about that

268
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:37,570
high and then they sink back down here's

269
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,610
another example so a lot more convection

270
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,770
happening in terms of plumes of warm air

271
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,440
rising but you'll notice that all these

272
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,240
things aren't very tall there's a limit

273
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,250
as to how tall each one these cumulus

274
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,600
clouds are if you watch this for a while

275
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,370
you'll see some of them like that one's

276
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,500
going to die there and then another

277
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,710
one's going to form so they're farming

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,440
and dying all the time as these thermals

279
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:06,070
rise hit the dew point and then cool

280
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:08,440
back down now what if we are able to

281
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,000
convict a little bit more and so this is

282
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,770
what's happening here so we might call

283
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,390
this moderate convection we've got a

284
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,490
thermal right here you can see that this

285
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,260
is right where the warm air is rising it

286
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,390
from the mountain going into the bottom

287
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,950
of the cloud and now the conditions are

288
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,440
a little different in this cloud is able

289
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,880
to grow vertically and it's growing a

290
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,840
lot more than it did in the previous

291
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,610
movies so we might say yeah this is

292
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,470
moderate convection it's it's growing

293
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,280
these convection cells are definitely

294
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:38,560
growing more than they did earlier

295
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,870
here's a another pretty significant

296
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,200
convection cell we might even go as far

297
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,720
as to call this deep convection here so

298
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,300
that here that the mountain again is

299
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,730
warm in the daytime sending up a Puma

300
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:57,190
warm air and forming this big convective

301
00:12:51,730 --> 00:13:00,160
cell right above it so question is then

302
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,110
why is it that some days I get

303
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,860
convection that's deep and sometimes

304
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,110
it's shallow

305
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,660
so there's several reasons but one of

306
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:11,410
them is just simply how hot is the air

307
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,910
down here where it rises so some of the

308
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,730
earlier movies I showed you that

309
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,410
convective cells were very shallow it

310
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,570
was early in the morning they weren't

311
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,950
very warm yet now this one is later in

312
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,190
the afternoon and you can see that

313
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,530
they're starting to grow taller

314
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,610
taller so you'll see this one now notice

315
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:31,910
that fuzz there so at some point and

316
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,020
we'll see it again here at some point

317
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,000
there's some fuzz right there

318
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,470
these convective cells will grow tall

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,660
enough that they're going to be forming

320
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,850
ice crystals and if you might remember

321
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,250
from the cloud lecture that ice looks

322
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,840
fuzzy right so you can see how this

323
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,330
one's starting to come and make an anvil

324
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,950
shape a little bit but it's a different

325
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,610
texture right there there's some fuzz

326
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,440
right there so there's a nice okay so

327
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,500
these clouds have our mixture they're a

328
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,290
mixture of ice and liquid the the hard

329
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,210
definite boundaries that's liquid or it

330
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,580
starts to get more kind of fuzzy on the

331
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,140
edges that's ice okay and this is

332
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,240
important for what we're going to be

333
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:12,890
talking about next but in order to make

334
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,280
precipitation in order to turn a cumulus

335
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:19,340
into a cumulonimbus we have to make ice

336
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,840
so here's another example and again you

337
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,320
can see the sharp definite boundaries

338
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,490
here that is liquid but up here you're

339
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,620
starting to see see that fuzz right

340
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,500
there it's a little fuzzy on the edges

341
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,210
this is starting to make ice okay and

342
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,110
the ice is going to be starting to form

343
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:40,040
near the top of the cloud so one more

344
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:42,860
movie here of convection and so here see

345
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:49,100
the fuzz right through there a little

346
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:50,720
bit okay so as this thing convex you'll

347
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,970
see areas that will start to turn a

348
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,220
little bit fuzzy I carry some over here

349
00:14:52,970 --> 00:15:01,250
a little bit there son right there

350
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:04,340
that's ice okay so at the top of a

351
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,250
really tall convecting cell you will

352
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,690
form ice now that ice is going to be

353
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,180
really important here because what's

354
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,700
going to happen is that ice is what's

355
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,310
ultimately going to be responsible for

356
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,200
nucleating precipitation so this is an

357
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,850
image that we saw in the previous

358
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,890
lecture and we were talking about how

359
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:28,400
the cloud droplets are actually

360
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,830
microscopic and rain droplets are

361
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,010
raindrops themselves are you know

362
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,590
several millimeters across and so the

363
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,000
question is well then how do we get

364
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,360
how do we go from little tiny

365
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,170
microscopic drops to these relatively

366
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,630
giant raindrops so most people have the

367
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,310
impression that cloud droplets will just

368
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,050
grow and grow and grow until they're so

369
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,300
big they become rain and they fall out

370
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,700
and it turns out that actually does not

371
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,280
happen it can happen in a few places

372
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,620
with really really high dew points like

373
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,600
in the tropics but where we live that

374
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,970
pretty much does not happen there's a

375
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,320
different process at work that's going

376
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,830
to get us from these little tiny

377
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,720
microscopic drops to big raindrops that

378
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,900
are big enough that you can you know

379
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,520
hold in your hand so let's imagine that

380
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,460
we've got one of these really tall

381
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,910
cumulus clouds it's got some fuzz on top

382
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,850
that's our ice and the ice itself would

383
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,260
be a little tiny microscopic particles a

384
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,750
little tiny crystals floating in the air

385
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,390
and they're gonna drift their way down

386
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,150
into the rest of the cloud and before we

387
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,190
talk about what happens next we'll talk

388
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,880
a little bit about how weird water

389
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,140
behaves in the cloud because down here

390
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,720
on the surface we're used to the idea

391
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,150
that water freezes at 32 degrees

392
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,010
Fahrenheit or zero degrees centigrade so

393
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:51,340
if I have a bowl of water and it's

394
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:53,890
sitting out at 32 I know that eventually

395
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,050
it'll completely freeze but the weird

396
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,480
thing is that if you have really really

397
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,920
really tiny microscopic droplets of

398
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,080
water which is what we have on clouds

399
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,750
because remember cloud droplets are

400
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,480
microscopic when they're this tiny they

401
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:10,750
have very little surface area it turns

402
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,209
out that what liquid water can stay in

403
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,550
the liquid state below the freezing

404
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,530
point in fact it can stay liquid all the

405
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,510
way down the minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit

406
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,830
which happens to also be minus 40

407
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,890
degrees centigrade

408
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,630
so these little droplets out in the

409
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,459
cloud even though the temperature is

410
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,520
below freezing they stay in their liquid

411
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:33,190
form and that's called supercooled water

412
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,030
okay so in our cloud there's actually

413
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:40,660
three zones at the top we have all ice

414
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:46,060
and the top part of the cloud is going

415
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:49,070
to be usually less than minus 40 degrees

416
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,630
Fahrenheit or so below that we

417
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:56,320
have what's called the mix portion of

418
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:59,690
the cloud it's ice and supercooled water

419
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,860
okay and by water I mean liquid right

420
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:07,760
and so then below that you know it gets

421
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:11,360
warmer as you go down we get to the part

422
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,680
that's all liquid and this part is going

423
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,130
to be above 32 right this is called the

424
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,390
warm part of the cloud okay so if you

425
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,700
were to watch what was happening up here

426
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,710
in this ice what you would notice is

427
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,690
that as the ice these little tiny

428
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,510
microscopic ice crystals when they drift

429
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,630
down into the supercooled part of the

430
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:35,420
cloud you would notice that those ice

431
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,480
crystals start to grow and they get

432
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,000
bigger and what's happening here is

433
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,640
another unusual process that we don't

434
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,740
experience in everyday life and what

435
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,610
happens is if you were to take ice

436
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:53,420
crystals and put them in the presence of

437
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:55,280
supercooled water so this represents the

438
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,750
cloud droplet and this represents the

439
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,960
little tiny microscopic ice crystals

440
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:03,470
floated in from above that water

441
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,210
molecules will preferentially attach

442
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,710
themselves to the ice in other words

443
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,110
they're actually abandoned ship they'll

444
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,120
leave the supercooled to liquid the

445
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,550
little cloud droplet and they'll attach

446
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,310
themselves to the ice so what happens is

447
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:19,010
the ice crystals start to grow and get

448
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:22,160
bigger as the cloud droplets become

449
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:28,180
smaller so in our cloud what happens is

450
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:31,190
this area is called the Bergeron process

451
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,770
that's the name for this and the

452
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,140
Bergeron process produces and I'm making

453
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,550
these way larger than they would be the

454
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,250
scale to the rest of the cloud but

455
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,780
eventually you get to something that you

456
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,790
might recognize because at some point

457
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:49,880
you make something that looks like a

458
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:52,670
snowflake and so these snowflakes fall

459
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,600
and if you were up in this part of the

460
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:59,120
cloud you think oh it's snowing and the

461
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,980
snow falls and it heads towards the

462
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,419
warmest part of the cloud and when it

463
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,330
passes through

464
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:10,070
to the warmest part of the cloud the

465
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:13,700
snowflakes melt and then each one of

466
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:16,629
those snowflakes melts to become a

467
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:21,619
raindrop and by the way I'm drawing

468
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:23,929
raindrops in a very incorrect manner but

469
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:25,879
every time you see rain drawn into

470
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:28,580
cartoon they're always drawn like little

471
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:30,529
teardrops but that's not that's not true

472
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,940
at all raindrops are actually perfectly

473
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,090
spherical when they fall through the

474
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,679
atmosphere but when they when they hit

475
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,690
your window they turn into a teardrop

476
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,999
shape so that's why everybody does that

477
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,549
so I'm propagating some misinformation

478
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:47,809
here but anyway these then fall out of

479
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:49,789
the cloud as precipitation and at this

480
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:51,470
point once you have precipitation

481
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:56,899
falling out of the bottom of the cloud

482
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:59,779
then you have a cumulonimbus so we can

483
00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:00,950
watch this process and so let's pay

484
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:03,529
attention to this one right here so

485
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,139
that's a cumulus cloud right now not

486
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,809
really any ice to speak of it's got a

487
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:10,489
flat bottom there's air that's rising up

488
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,590
as thermals hitting the dew point

489
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:14,840
relative humidity a hundred percent all

490
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,600
that good stuff going up into the cloud

491
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,419
and the cloud is growing and getting

492
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,619
taller so this material up there will

493
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,600
see that that's starting to look like

494
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:27,139
some ice up there okay we're getting a

495
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,379
little bits of ice keep watching it here

496
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:34,039
there's a little bit of fuzz there okay

497
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:35,899
now over here that's definitely starting

498
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,109
to look like ice it's getting a fuzzy

499
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:42,169
edge on it and then down here if you

500
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:44,960
watch right there we're starting to see

501
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:45,859
precipitation okay so we got ice for

502
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,690
sure right there

503
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,100
we got precipitation coming out of the

504
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,859
bottom of the cloud there so now we've

505
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,289
got cumulonimbus now sometimes what

506
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:56,539
falls out of the cloud could still be

507
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:58,940
snow and the snow a melt on its way down

508
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:02,899
or sometimes it melts within the cloud

509
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:07,970
but the point is that every will every

510
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:11,059
raindrop is a melted snowflake so if it

511
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:14,509
is raining down here it's snowing up

512
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:15,770
there now if you lived in the tropics it

513
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:19,970
turns out that

514
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:21,320
this process isn't required and there

515
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,850
are so much water vapor in the

516
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,620
atmosphere in the tropics the mixing

517
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,300
ratios or the dew points are so high

518
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,890
that actually you can get direct

519
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:34,160
condensation of cloud droplets into

520
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:36,920
bigger droplets that then fall as rain

521
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,800
and so this is a diagram from a textbook

522
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,200
where it shows these coalescing cloud

523
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,420
droplets that become a bigger raindrop

524
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,920
and as it falls down it crashes into

525
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,830
more of them and then it'll break apart

526
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,030
into further ones and they will they

527
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,880
will come out at the bottom of the cloud

528
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,320
that no ice isn't necessary but where we

529
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,920
live and pretty much anywhere in North

530
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,590
America we need the Bergeron process to

531
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,140
make rain okay so that's pretty much

532
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,920
always happening in our part of the of

533
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:12,050
the world now another thing that happens

534
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:15,920
is we've been talking about up until now

535
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:18,830
we've been talking about how the clouds

536
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,900
have air moving up into them right we

537
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,090
did the whole convection activity what's

538
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:26,330
still happening with this so there's

539
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:36,980
warm air that's rising and entering the

540
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:40,670
cloud and going up into the cloud and it

541
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:47,270
forms this upgoing draft that's called

542
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:50,000
the updraft and in fact this part of the

543
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,350
cloud right here where they where the

544
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,160
air is going in is some kind of

545
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:59,210
sometimes called the intake so there's

546
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,920
actively air moving into the cloud now

547
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,740
the other thing that's happening is

548
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,900
we've got precipitation that's being

549
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,790
formed on this side so you've got

550
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,290
another draft that's going in the

551
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:13,340
opposite direction so you've got air

552
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:18,260
that's moving downwards and this

553
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,920
downward moving current is called the

554
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,920
downdraft

555
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:28,880
and the downdraft comes out the bottom

556
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:31,730
of the cloud with the precipitation so

557
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,300
if I look at a typical thunderstorm here

558
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:37,550
in Albuquerque so there is the

559
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,380
precipitation so the downdraft is

560
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:42,500
occurring right here we've got there

561
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:45,500
would be some kind of wind vertical wind

562
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,150
coming down with that the intake the

563
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,070
updraft is happening somewhere over here

564
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:53,420
so somewhere over here is where the air

565
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:57,140
is going up into the cloud now what can

566
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,880
happen is that these downdraft winds can

567
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,790
pick up a lot of speed for reasons we'll

568
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,320
discuss in a second and as they pick up

569
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,840
speed they come down and they come

570
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,230
crashing into the ground by picking up

571
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,390
speed

572
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,010
I mean we've actually measured some in

573
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,020
excess of 70 miles an hour comes

574
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,720
straight down and when they hit the

575
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,400
ground they splat and so you can see how

576
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,370
you've got rain coming straight down and

577
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,700
then it's like it's squishing outwards

578
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:24,620
that is wind in this kind of downdraft

579
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,450
we have a really strong vertical wind

580
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,850
associated with it it's called a

581
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,040
microburst so anybody that's down there

582
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,810
right now is not only getting rain but

583
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,770
it's getting a strong wind associated

584
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:39,920
with it so here's an illustration of how

585
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:42,650
that would look so remember that up in

586
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,390
the cloud the relative humidity is a

587
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,450
hundred percent so there's no

588
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,480
evaporation taking place as soon as

589
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,450
raindrops leave the leave the cloud and

590
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,710
go into the air column below the cloud

591
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,060
they're entering an environment where

592
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,080
the relative humidity is less than 100%

593
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,600
because that happens the raindrops are

594
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,790
subject to evaporation if you live in a

595
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,980
dry climate like we do you might have

596
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:09,310
really low relative humidities down here

597
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,720
and what that means is you get

598
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:15,050
evaporation of the raindrops as they're

599
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,450
falling if raindrops evaporate remember

600
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,850
from several lectures ago that removes

601
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,560
latent heat from the system see if to

602
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,270
imagine water molecules leaving with

603
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,360
their little boxes of thermal energy in

604
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:30,470
this diagram that means this air column

605
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,970
that's now raindrops and air and the

606
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,430
whole thing is being cooled by the

607
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,560
removal latent heat this whole column

608
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,510
here is becoming cold

609
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,850
and when you make something when you

610
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:43,510
make Eric Holder it becomes denser and

611
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:46,480
it becomes denser it sinks faster so

612
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,850
this whole blob becomes a sinking blob

613
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,130
of cold air that's accelerating towards

614
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,840
the surface of the earth and it hits

615
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,290
again like I said you hit 70 miles an

616
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,480
hour has nowhere to go except out and so

617
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,400
it produces these winds that move out in

618
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:08,980
all directions those are called the

619
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:12,760
outflow so back in our diagram here we

620
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,610
can add this in so if this is happening

621
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:23,410
in our in our cloud where it hits the

622
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:29,830
ground and spreads out this cold air has

623
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:33,940
a name it's called the outflow and right

624
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:39,160
at the boundary where this occurs this

625
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:40,540
is called the gust front and we'll talk

626
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,920
more about that in a second but right

627
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,890
now with the way that we've drawn this

628
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,900
this area right in here is where the

629
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,270
microburst is occurring right so if you

630
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,310
live right here during this you're

631
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:55,510
getting a lot of rain and a lot of wind

632
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:59,020
as well so here's an example of what we

633
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:01,150
call a wet microburst and you can tell

634
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,520
us a microburst because you can see it

635
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,200
spreading out on the edges there so

636
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,060
there must be some pretty strong wind

637
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,320
that's coming down hitting the ground

638
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:13,300
and spreading out so here's some video

639
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,970
footage from a microburst occurring in

640
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,400
Phoenix and you can see that this is the

641
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,590
column this is the downdraft you can

642
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,450
even see it moving in this and it hits

643
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,680
the ground and spreads out so people

644
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,130
that are living down there are

645
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,290
experiencing not only high amounts of

646
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,520
rain but high winds as well and you can

647
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,580
see it's spreading out to the side there

648
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,810
right so even people out here are

649
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,350
experiencing the outflow the wind that's

650
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,160
coming from this a severe thunderstorm

651
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:43,630
here's another one

652
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,880
from Tucson and so this one it's during

653
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,380
the middle of this a downpour it's going

654
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,910
to generate a microburst and they're

655
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,330
going to zoom in on it you can see it

656
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,820
come too

657
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,029
and splat against the surface down there

658
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,559
they'll show it a couple more times here

659
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:59,669
because here it is again so there's a

660
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,739
blob of cold air comes down splat and

661
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:03,970
then again so each time you see this

662
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:07,029
they're just showing the same thing over

663
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,929
and over but it's a particularly cold

664
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:12,850
blob of air accelerates on the way down

665
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:14,139
splats against the ground creates a high

666
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,200
wind that spreads out in all directions

667
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:20,139
so anybody down here is experiencing not

668
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,690
only rain but a sudden pretty strong

669
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:24,909
cold wind the fact this is what it looks

670
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,749
like from the ground in one of these and

671
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:30,279
then we're somewhere in Arizona and

672
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:31,779
we're under a thunderstorm but the

673
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:36,149
microburst hasn't started yet

674
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:38,499
there it is and we can get

675
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,600
hurricane-force winds you know they

676
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:42,190
don't last long but enough to do a lot

677
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,450
of damage they'll knock over trees and

678
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:49,359
houses and cars and all kinds of stuff

679
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,769
now there is another type of microburst

680
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,690
what we just saw was something called

681
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:55,330
the wet microburst because it's raining

682
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,460
at the surface or it gets wet there's

683
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,950
also something called a dry microburst

684
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,950
and we are particularly prone to these

685
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,210
in New Mexico and Arizona so what we're

686
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,200
looking at here is we got some kind of

687
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:10,480
cumulonimbus up off the screen here and

688
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,940
these streaks that's rain that's coming

689
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,409
down and it's evaporating on the way to

690
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:20,529
the surface well as its evaporating as a

691
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:23,259
as we just said you're losing latent

692
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:26,919
heat so you're making this column of air

693
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:28,239
cold and we call this vergis of vergas

694
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,269
whenever you have rain that just

695
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:32,109
disappears on the way to the ground so

696
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,509
here it is again

697
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:37,090
so there's rain that's falling is liquid

698
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:40,029
but the air column down here is pretty

699
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,950
dry low relative humidity you get

700
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,600
evaporation evaporation evaporation and

701
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,489
then finally there's nothing left you're

702
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,840
standing down here you're not getting

703
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:49,389
rained on even though the rains falling

704
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,179
above your head but what is happening is

705
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:54,489
the evaporation of all that rain is

706
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:57,460
removing latent heat and you're making a

707
00:30:54,489 --> 00:31:00,009
column of really cold air that's really

708
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,169
dense and it sinks down and go splat

709
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:02,710
against the surface it just doesn't have

710
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:04,840
any water

711
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,210
with it we call that the dry microburst

712
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,620
so here's one so we can't see the

713
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,960
cumulonimbus that's up off the screen

714
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,450
here but there's a blob of invisible

715
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,860
cold air that has sunk down hit the

716
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,659
ground and you can see it's spreading

717
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,029
out so if you're down here the

718
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:22,000
experiences is all of a sudden it got

719
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:25,090
really windy and they heard suddenly got

720
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,770
colder usually here's another one it

721
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,059
looks like there's a look to you like

722
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,409
somebody just dropped something out of

723
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,210
the cloud and went down and went splat

724
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,590
that's pretty much what happened there

725
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,260
was some rain that came out it

726
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,570
completely evaporated made a blob of

727
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,990
sinking cold air accelerates runs into

728
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,029
the ground

729
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,830
that's all dust down there that's all

730
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:46,440
dust from the winds from the dry

731
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:48,850
microburst now microbursts can be pretty

732
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,409
dangerous and if I go back to this

733
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:55,919
picture that we just drew this so it's

734
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:58,720
dangerous to be down here in in the

735
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,760
microburst but this outflow is going to

736
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,700
keep going in the front of this this

737
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,399
gust front here I mean it can still be

738
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,990
moving along pretty good clip maybe so

739
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,809
many miles an hour or something like

740
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,649
that and it can do a lot of damage so a

741
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:16,779
few years ago Indiana State Fair they're

742
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:18,070
setting up for a concert and there's a

743
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:19,299
thunderstorm that's coming and you can

744
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,789
see in the distance there and the

745
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:24,309
thunderstorm produces a microburst which

746
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:27,309
makes the outflow the outflow wind comes

747
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:30,070
and basically invades the fair and

748
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:32,529
knocks over this whole stadium set up

749
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:35,669
and killed I think seven people and

750
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:39,520
injured about 50 or so so that is the

751
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:44,649
outflow that did that another thing that

752
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:48,100
can happen is if you have if you live in

753
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:51,760
a place that's very very dry like where

754
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:54,789
we live as this outflow is going across

755
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,250
the surface not only is it doing damage

756
00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:02,230
just from the wind but it can be blowing

757
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:04,659
up a big cloud of dust and you

758
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:09,429
essentially make a big dust storm and

759
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:11,320
that's called a haboob it's a Arabic

760
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:14,110
term from the Middle East they get a lot

761
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,340
of those over there here's a picture one

762
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:19,880
and there are some famous

763
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,980
images in movies of who boobs from the

764
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,010
Phoenix area and so we got a

765
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,900
cumulonimbus here and it's generating an

766
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,330
outflow so this this whole thing is a

767
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:33,170
big blob of cold air creeping along the

768
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:35,690
surface and the as it moves across the

769
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,280
surface everybody that's in its way gets

770
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,230
covered in dust

771
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,350
so there's another picture of it from

772
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:44,740
above so here's a good time lapse of a

773
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,460
haboob again this was from Phoenix area

774
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,710
here it comes

775
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,070
you notice also that there's clouds

776
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,660
right above it that grow along with it

777
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,340
that's because as the cold air comes

778
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,560
along the ground it shows up the other

779
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,480
air out of the way and actually will

780
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,810
form clouds above it and sometimes will

781
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,750
trigger new thunderstorms here's another

782
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:08,380
one here's some excerpts from again

783
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:11,390
another YouTube clip where this guy

784
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,120
drives into the who boobs so here you

785
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,860
can see the edge of it so that would be

786
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,900
the guest front right along the edge and

787
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:21,680
he's going to drive right into it

788
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:25,730
because why not and as he does so you'll

789
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:29,030
see that at its peak it pretty much

790
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,130
looks like night and later on in the

791
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,390
semester we'll talk about droughts and

792
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:36,200
if you've heard about the Dust Bowl

793
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:37,970
drought in the 1930s they were dealing

794
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,040
with this kind of on a regular basis in

795
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,450
places like Oklahoma so this is the

796
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,630
middle of day and it's starting to look

797
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,070
like the middle of the night so this

798
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,440
might explain something that you've

799
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:52,070
experienced yourself if you live in New

800
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,100
Mexico you be at home it'll be a nice

801
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:57,310
clear day no clouds no wind completely

802
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,810
calm and all of a sudden out of nowhere

803
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,270
you said they're hit by this blast of

804
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:05,120
wind like where did that come from well

805
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,430
it could have been an outflow so what

806
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,230
might be happening is clerk on the other

807
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,850
side of the state like maybe in Carlsbad

808
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:14,810
they've got a severe thunderstorm and

809
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:17,780
they get a strong downdraft which then

810
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,580
turns into a strong outflow and believe

811
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,910
it or not the outflows can go all the

812
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:24,470
way across the state and you can track

813
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,020
them on radar I've tracked them on radar

814
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,880
all the way from Eastern New Mexico

815
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,150
clear into Arizona

816
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,940
and and so it's so far away that you

817
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,950
actually don't even see any clouds right

818
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,110
I mean the the cumulonimbus itself is

819
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,220
clear out of sight so that's something

820
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,280
that we actually experience here

821
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,440
especially in June and then into the

822
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,120
monsoon season you may experience these

823
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,500
outflows that just come out of nowhere

824
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,490
so another one of the hazards of

825
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,420
convective storms is that of hail and

826
00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:00,230
scientists are still trying to work out

827
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:02,210
exactly how hail forms but it seems

828
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,790
pretty apparent that hail must have to

829
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,520
spend longer in the cumulonimbus cloud

830
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:10,970
than standard rain and one of the clues

831
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,830
is that often hail has these growth

832
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:15,320
rings so if you cut up chunk of hail

833
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:18,560
open especially a large one you'll see

834
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,530
these concentric rings and if you think

835
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,860
about what we've talked about so far

836
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:27,350
with these convective storms so the

837
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:29,540
story is you know we create a snowflake

838
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,820
the snowflake falls and melts and one

839
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,250
snowflake makes one drain raindrop which

840
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,200
comes out the bottom but we also have

841
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,730
these pretty strong down drafts and

842
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,860
updrafts and they're right next to each

843
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:41,780
other in the cloud so it's been

844
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,450
speculated that what happens if some of

845
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,390
these raindrops somehow got caught up in

846
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:50,030
this updraft and they have brought back

847
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,070
up to the top into the into the frozen

848
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:55,190
part of the cloud and then they came

849
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:59,690
back down and as they did so they would

850
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:01,790
grow another growth ring and maybe if

851
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,280
the conditions were right they could go

852
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,530
around in and around several times so

853
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,000
that's one idea now some of the most

854
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,350
recent research shows that actually

855
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,810
that's probably not what happens

856
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:14,930
probably what happens is that the

857
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:18,050
initial raindrop falls down and then

858
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:21,230
gets picked up and probably spend

859
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,690
several kind of paths back and forth up

860
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,780
in this supercool part of the cloud

861
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:29,510
before falling back down so it's not

862
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,790
necessarily a loop-de-loop as much as it

863
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,380
is updrafts just kind of giving it a

864
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:36,620
little push now and then to keep it in

865
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,780
the cloud for a little bit longer so

866
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,839
locally we have a pretty famous

867
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:44,499
hailstorm that occurred is

868
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,869
Koro 2004 and these are some pictures

869
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:50,779
from that storm as you can see there are

870
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:54,049
some you know baseball sized hail that

871
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:56,390
came down during the storm storm lasted

872
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:58,460
something like 45 minutes and these are

873
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:01,130
some pictures from people's backyards

874
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:04,400
where the hailstones just smashed

875
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,440
everybody's lawn furniture and New

876
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,119
Mexico Tech was in session so the

877
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,210
students come out to find their cars all

878
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,999
beat up like this one or something like

879
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,729
that and occasionally even today you'll

880
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:18,859
see a banged up car in Socorro with the

881
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:22,279
bumper sticker saying I survived the

882
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:25,519
hailstorm I also posted a document on

883
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:28,549
learn that was kind of goes over some of

884
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,130
the damage and some of the results from

885
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:33,799
the Socorro hailstorm here's some

886
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:36,349
pictures where the all the back windows

887
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:41,539
are broken out these are cars at New

888
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:43,130
Mexico Tech again this is when this

889
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:45,049
picture was taken it was the largest

890
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,029
ever measured hail stone I'm not sure if

891
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:49,400
it still is or not but this is from

892
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:51,200
Oklahoma and if you look at this it kind

893
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,059
of looks like a you see a bunch of

894
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,219
individual hailstones that are all kind

895
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:59,749
of stuck together like a conglomerate

896
00:38:55,219 --> 00:39:03,650
here and the biggest hailstones

897
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:05,119
don't come from New Mexico they do tend

898
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,880
to come from the Midwest and we'll talk

899
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:12,529
a little bit here exactly what's going

900
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:14,779
on with that sometimes you can see the

901
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:17,749
hail come down as it's kind of bright

902
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:20,509
white it's called the hail shaft and it

903
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:25,069
looks significantly wider than normal

904
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:26,869
precipitation does of course one of the

905
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:28,339
most dangerous hazards of convective

906
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:30,619
storms is that of lightning and

907
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:32,779
lightning it turns out is not very well

908
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:35,989
understood it's very difficult to study

909
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:38,839
because it can kill you so there's a few

910
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:41,180
things that we know and it's been

911
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:44,599
observed that in a lot of thunderstorms

912
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:47,059
cumulonimbus clouds that there's an

913
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:49,130
excess of electrons in the bottom part

914
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:50,779
of the cloud and the deficiency of

915
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,999
electrons in the top part of the cloud

916
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:54,319
so if you have excess electrons that

917
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,079
means you have a negative charge down

918
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,430
here

919
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,799
you don't have enough electrons you have

920
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,289
a positive charge up there now

921
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:05,099
what would cause this so if you've ever

922
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:08,009
taken a balloon and you rub it on your

923
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:10,140
hair and it sticks to the wall so what

924
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:12,450
you've done there is the motion of you

925
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,160
rubbing it on your hair moves the

926
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:17,880
electrons from one spot to another spot

927
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,959
and then it gets a static charge so

928
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,059
remember that in the cumulonimbus right

929
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:25,859
we've got the updraft we've got the

930
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:28,079
downdraft and they're right next to each

931
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,700
other so it's very likely you've got

932
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,759
places in the cloud where you've got air

933
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:35,430
sliding past each other and maybe that's

934
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:37,729
stripping off electrons from one part of

935
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:41,059
the cloud and bringing them to another

936
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:44,759
maybe I'm probably more realistic

937
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:46,979
possibility is that if you have solid

938
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:49,410
particles like ice crystals and they

939
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:52,019
bang into each other that also strips

940
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:56,339
electrons off so it might be either one

941
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:59,309
or some of both that do this but in a

942
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:01,259
typical cloud you've got these electrons

943
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:02,880
near the bottom and you've got a

944
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:05,789
deficiency near the top and these

945
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,589
electrons what they want is they want to

946
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:12,329
get up to here that's where they'd like

947
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:16,199
to be well it also turns out that you've

948
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:18,839
got positive charges down here on the

949
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,209
ground so the earth itself has a slight

950
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,479
positive charge especially compared to

951
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:27,839
the bottom of this cloud well when that

952
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:31,199
charge builds up to a certain point the

953
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,099
electrons start coming out of the cloud

954
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:37,650
in what's called a step the leader so

955
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,199
this is not lightning yet it's some

956
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,779
ionized gas that comes out of the cloud

957
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,249
and these electrons don't know where

958
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:46,650
they're going so it's just kind of a

959
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:52,709
random pattern and they in the branch

960
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:56,400
and as they get closer to the ground the

961
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:57,839
positive charges that are down here you

962
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,579
know they were you know opposite charges

963
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,910
attract so they're attracted to this so

964
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:06,660
they're going to start climbing tall

965
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:08,260
things and they're going to make a

966
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,670
little branch

967
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,960
up into the air okay so these guys don't

968
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,550
know where these guys are these guys

969
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,170
don't know where those guys are but they

970
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,270
can sense each other and that there's a

971
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,420
there's a mutual attraction between the

972
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:24,700
positive and they give the charges

973
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,770
well eventually one of these step

974
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,210
leaders which again is just randomly

975
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:32,110
moving it doesn't know where it's going

976
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,490
will accidentally come in contact with

977
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:36,010
one of these and these are called

978
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,750
streamers that the positive charges from

979
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,940
the below so the step leader

980
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:43,060
accidentally hits a streamer and now

981
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,130
you've got a connection between the

982
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,110
excess of electrons down here and a

983
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:50,770
deficiency of electrons down there and

984
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:53,560
the result is this is actually the

985
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:55,660
lightning strike that you see so all

986
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,950
this step leader business that I just

987
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,350
drew that all happens within

988
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,660
milliseconds and you don't see it what

989
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:04,330
you see is when these two things touch

990
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,250
each other and completes the circuit and

991
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,560
you get lightning you get a current and

992
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,900
the current actually flows from ground

993
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,240
to cloud see if you slow down lightning

994
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,030
what you'll see is you will see the

995
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,400
lightning discharged going up into the

996
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,980
cloud and that's the part you see even

997
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,260
those fraction of a second that's what

998
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,500
you see and everything that came before

999
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,900
that is invisible to the eye now I've

1000
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,660
got some video here that has been slowed

1001
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:35,080
down a lot and we can kind of see these

1002
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:38,710
stepped leaders a little bit so here's

1003
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,360
the first one now but you'll see here

1004
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,090
come the step leaders out of the cloud

1005
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,370
now the grounds down here that one did

1006
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,870
not hit the ground you can see they're

1007
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:49,360
just kind of randomly shooting out they

1008
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:55,710
don't know where they're going this is

1009
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:58,180
not lightning yet that one came close

1010
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,310
and all of a sudden right there one of

1011
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:03,640
them hit the ground okay and that's the

1012
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:06,400
actual lightning that you see okay so

1013
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,360
I've got another one here again slowed

1014
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,060
down a lot

1015
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:15,760
here come the step leaders you can see

1016
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:17,410
them coming down and then bang those two

1017
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,480
hit the ground about the same time and

1018
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:23,160
then you get a return current and that's

1019
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,160
the lightning bolt that you actually see

1020
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:31,250
now watch these two buildings those two

1021
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:34,790
things those are the streamers streamers

1022
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:39,530
are very difficult to photograph so we

1023
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:46,330
have just a few images of them right

1024
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:46,330
there I think there's one more here

1025
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:54,980
right there okay so that so if you go on

1026
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,350
YouTube you can find videos of the step

1027
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,780
leaders coming down it's very difficult

1028
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:01,460
to find footage of the streamers going

1029
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:04,880
up there they're a lot harder to

1030
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,850
photograph but we have a few now the

1031
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,780
other thing that could happen

1032
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:14,450
besides these electrons coming down and

1033
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:17,210
hitting the ground is they could also in

1034
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,040
fact get up here and join the rest of

1035
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,540
the cloud up there right because they

1036
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,210
just want to get to a positive charge

1037
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,640
doesn't matter which way they do it so

1038
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:29,990
you could also have if the charge builds

1039
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:32,750
up you could also have a connection

1040
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:36,230
between these two parts of the cloud and

1041
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:38,120
you get lightning in the cloud or you

1042
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:41,030
can get lightning from cloud to cloud

1043
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,240
and in fact when people have flown

1044
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:47,330
planes intentionally flown planes

1045
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:50,450
through thunderstorms to study this kind

1046
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:52,820
of stuff what they often find is that in

1047
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:55,670
a typical thunderstorm that you might

1048
00:45:52,820 --> 00:46:00,050
have a pocket a positive charge in one

1049
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:04,700
spot and then you'll have a pocket of

1050
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:06,440
negative charge in another spot and you

1051
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,920
can have several pockets in different

1052
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,450
places and you'll get charging from you

1053
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,430
know discharging I should say from one

1054
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:16,100
to the other well you'll get lightning

1055
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:18,230
will flash from one part of the cloud to

1056
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,330
the other part of the cloud or from one

1057
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,250
part of the cloud from one cloud to

1058
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,750
another cloud so you might get lightning

1059
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,420
from here to here you might get

1060
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,430
lightning from here to here so not all

1061
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,140
lightning is to the ground you can get

1062
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:33,440
what's called inter cloud and

1063
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,180
intra-cloud lightning so if you ever go

1064
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,480
on YouTube

1065
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:41,329
there's a user named Pecos Hank and he

1066
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,190
takes just fabulous lightning movies and

1067
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:45,470
he has like hundreds of these videos so

1068
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,599
this is all intercloud and intra-cloud

1069
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,430
lightning and you can see there's very

1070
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,250
little lightning actually going to the

1071
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:55,010
ground it's going you know from cloud to

1072
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,839
cloud or within one part of the cloud to

1073
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,089
another but all lightning is the same

1074
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:01,579
thing its electrons want to get from one

1075
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:03,520
place to another and when the charge

1076
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:06,740
builds up high enough they can finally

1077
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,869
break down the air and make their own

1078
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,900
path and that's what creates the

1079
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:13,880
lightning bolt so associated with

1080
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,040
lightning is Thunder and the lightning

1081
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,859
bolt itself is about six to eight inches

1082
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,230
wide and so that during that brief

1083
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:22,880
instant when electricity is flowing

1084
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:25,280
through the lightning bolt you've got

1085
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,349
this six to eight inch air column that's

1086
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,589
being heated to thousands of degrees and

1087
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:32,930
when you heat air air expands so what

1088
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:35,780
that means is as the lightning is

1089
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:39,589
happening the air in that column is

1090
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:42,160
being pushed out because it's so hot but

1091
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:44,900
then when the lightnings over with

1092
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,060
there's nothing to keep that air column

1093
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,099
hot and so the lightnings over with

1094
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,230
there's a very little air in here and

1095
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:53,720
it's like a vacuum and the surrounding

1096
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:56,869
air slaps that call them back together

1097
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:59,030
and that's what makes thunder so every

1098
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:03,260
time you have lightning it's generating

1099
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:06,140
thunder now thunder moves at the speed

1100
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,240
of sound and the speed of sound is it

1101
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:11,030
can go about one mile every five seconds

1102
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,470
so when you see a flash in the distance

1103
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,420
if you start counting

1104
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:17,869
one-mississippi two-mississippi

1105
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:20,839
three-mississippi then when you hear the

1106
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:24,200
thunder you will know how many miles

1107
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:26,780
away that lightning is right so if you

1108
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,839
count to 15 seconds then it's about

1109
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:33,740
three miles away now a kind of a weird

1110
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,180
thing happens if you're over 20 or so

1111
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,760
miles away it kind of depends on the

1112
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:40,250
conditions but it turns out sound waves

1113
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,670
when they travel long distances they

1114
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:47,450
refract upwards and if you're over 20

1115
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:48,260
miles from from a lightning storm you

1116
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,240
will actually hear

1117
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,790
the Thunder it's actually moved up and

1118
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,070
refracted over your head and I get this

1119
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:58,730
question sometimes from students asking

1120
00:48:55,070 --> 00:49:00,650
me about heat lightning and this is kind

1121
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,660
of a folklore that there's certain kind

1122
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,440
of lightning that you can't hear but

1123
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,630
that's not true

1124
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,130
all lightning makes thunder but if

1125
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,660
you're too far away from it you just

1126
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:12,250
don't hear it so you see flashes in the

1127
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:15,890
distance but you never hear the Thunder

1128
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:18,470
so we've been talking about all kinds of

1129
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:20,210
hazards associated with the downdraft

1130
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:22,040
right we talked about the outflow and

1131
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:25,640
the haboob and all that stuff there's

1132
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:28,400
also some hazards associated with the

1133
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,220
updraft and one of them is quite simple

1134
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,360
which is that if you are in an

1135
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:37,160
ultralight aircraft or a balloon or

1136
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,170
parachuter you don't want to get too

1137
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,790
close to this cloud because you could

1138
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:43,190
literally get sucked up into the cloud

1139
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:46,190
and there's an aviation term for this

1140
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:48,950
it's called cloud suck and so cloud suck

1141
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:51,590
is a real thing and occasionally people

1142
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,780
get sucked up into the clouds when they

1143
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:56,270
don't want to be kind of a famous

1144
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:58,970
accident in 1925 this is a blimp the

1145
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:01,580
shenandoah and it got too close to one

1146
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:04,580
of these convecting clouds got sucked up

1147
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:06,230
in it and crashed and if you pay

1148
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,090
attention to the news every once in a

1149
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,400
while you will run across people who

1150
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:13,570
have been sucked up into clouds during

1151
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,040
uh you know hang gliding or paragliding

1152
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:18,740
almost always they die this woman

1153
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,320
somehow or another lived and apparently

1154
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,030
she got sucked up into a cloud

1155
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:25,580
immediately went unconscious spent like

1156
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,650
an hour in that in this cloud I was

1157
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,970
covered in ice and somehow or another

1158
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:35,870
survived all this but most people do not

1159
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:38,870
of course the most common hazard of the

1160
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,160
intake or the updraft is the tornado and

1161
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:43,250
if conditions are right and you have

1162
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,340
really strong convection the intake the

1163
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:48,530
updraft actually can start forming a

1164
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,150
tornado and I just loved this video

1165
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:54,410
because this guy he's actually driving

1166
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:56,030
towards the tornado and this is one of

1167
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:59,270
the cleanest views I've ever seen of a

1168
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:00,710
tornado it's so much so that it kind of

1169
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,640
looks fake right like if you saw that in

1170
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:05,000
a movie you

1171
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,470
being that that's fake so in order to

1172
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,210
get a tornado you need some very

1173
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:09,980
vigorous convection you need very

1174
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:12,140
unstable air but you also need a couple

1175
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:14,450
other things one thing you need is

1176
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,390
something called wind shear and when

1177
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,920
shear means that the wind is blowing

1178
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:21,589
stronger above your head than it is near

1179
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,089
the surface and what that does is it

1180
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:27,710
makes the air near the ground kind of

1181
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:30,529
spin in a circle right then you've got

1182
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,809
thermals so what we talked about except

1183
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:36,589
the thermals now are going to push that

1184
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:39,019
spinning air upwards and if it does it

1185
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:42,500
just right you can take that spinning

1186
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:46,130
air and reorient it vertically and then

1187
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:50,470
the air intake the updraft is spinning

1188
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:53,269
and you get a tornado now if you look at

1189
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:56,990
tornadoes across the country there's

1190
00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:58,880
definitely a spot that is weather far

1191
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:01,220
more common we call this Tornado Alley

1192
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,950
and it's kind of centered here in

1193
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:06,259
Oklahoma and so we're gonna talk a

1194
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:09,259
little bit about why this is before I do

1195
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:10,880
notice that you know the tornadoes looks

1196
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:13,279
like in this map they completely stop

1197
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,099
right there that's not entirely true

1198
00:52:13,279 --> 00:52:19,099
here's another way that you can look at

1199
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:21,319
tornadoes so this is 56 years of tornado

1200
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:24,130
tracks everyone these blue lines and

1201
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:27,559
again like most of them are out here and

1202
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,240
something is causing them to stop right

1203
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,579
around here but they don't completely go

1204
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,519
away and you can see there's a little

1205
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:37,910
blue lines all over the place here where

1206
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:39,950
there have been tornadoes so imagine if

1207
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,630
we just cut the country right in half

1208
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,430
right through here right through Tornado

1209
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:45,500
Alley and we kind of looked at it from

1210
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,970
the side so we make what's called a

1211
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,390
cross-section right through the country

1212
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:54,140
and we got south to the right north to

1213
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:56,119
the left what kind of air is over here

1214
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:58,549
off in other words if we went south of

1215
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:00,950
the country where do we end up we end up

1216
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:02,420
in the Gulf of Mexico right so what's

1217
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:06,890
the air from there like well it's going

1218
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:10,670
to be very warm and gonna have very high

1219
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:14,269
dew points right so a lot of water in

1220
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:15,350
that air air from the north is coming

1221
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:18,890
down from Canada

1222
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:24,740
and it's going to be very cold and very

1223
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:28,250
dry yes we got cold and dry coming from

1224
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:31,370
the north so if these two air masses

1225
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:33,290
come together there's going to be a

1226
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:35,780
place kind of in the middle where you

1227
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:37,760
have warm air on the bottom and you have

1228
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:40,550
cold air on top now if you remember from

1229
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,740
the convection assignment we had one

1230
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,000
page where you you drew the clouds and

1231
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,430
they went up a certain height and then

1232
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,620
you went to the next page and we had

1233
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,960
cold air aloft and the clouds grew up

1234
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,390
off the page well that's kind of what's

1235
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,100
happening here because you've got warm

1236
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:57,200
air on the bottom and cold air on the

1237
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,930
top it's very easy for this warm air to

1238
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:04,670
convict upwards and you get really tall

1239
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:06,980
big strong cumulonimbus clouds and where

1240
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:10,280
do these two meet typically they meet

1241
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:14,840
right around Oklahoma so if I go back to

1242
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:17,330
this map I can imagine I've got warm

1243
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:19,700
humid air from the Gulf of Mexico coming

1244
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:21,650
from the south I got cold dry air coming

1245
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,930
from the north they kind of meet up in

1246
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:27,080
here so what so why doesn't it happen

1247
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:30,230
over here well the Rocky Mountains form

1248
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:34,460
a barrier for us us meaning us in New

1249
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:36,230
Mexico for the most part the the edge of

1250
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:39,170
the mountains prevents the cold air from

1251
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:41,690
coming down it kind of keeps it on the

1252
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:44,060
side of the mountains and it keeps the

1253
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:45,860
warm human air also on the side of the

1254
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,960
mountain so these mountains really kind

1255
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:51,470
of keep both of those pools of air away

1256
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,090
from us and so we don't have much you

1257
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:55,370
know we don't have a lot of really in

1258
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:57,020
stable air and we don't have really

1259
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,660
severe thunderstorms in this part of the

1260
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,720
country compared to over here in Tornado

1261
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,720
Alley

1262
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,750
so that's all we're going to talk about

1263
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:10,790
with convective storms I'm gonna leave

1264
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:13,460
you with some time lapse of some

1265
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:15,560
