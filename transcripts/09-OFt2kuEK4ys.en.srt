1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,830
hey how you doing this is Mel strong and

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,139
this is a lecture on air pressure and

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,510
wind now we've talked about air pressure

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,490
in the previous lecture and what we said

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,130
is we looked at an animation like this

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,870
and we talked about how air molecules

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,310
fly in a straight line till they collide

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,670
with something so they quite with each

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,950
other or they collide with surfaces so

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,830
every surface that's exposed to the

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,420
atmosphere is being hit by air molecules

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,120
billions of times a second and that

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,040
produces a pressure now the earth is

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,710
trying to pull all the air down to the

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,450
ground and it can't get it all down

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,920
there but what it does do is it

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,440
increases the amount of air that's

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,090
closer to the surface which increases

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,340
the air pressure that's closer to the

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,440
surface as you go up into the atmosphere

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,460
there's less air molecules flying around

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,100
so there's less air pressure so we have

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,469
some units that we use to describe air

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,120
pressure and one of them is maybe this

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,119
is the one that's familiar to you it's

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,450
psi pounds per square inch it's the

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,420
easiest one to visualize so imagine one

28
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,079
inch by one inch square so if I have 15

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,880
psi that means I got 15 pounds pushing

30
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,659
down on each square

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,219
okay now psi we use in tires so the if

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,459
you look on site of your tires will have

33
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,590
a PSI rating or inflatable toys or balls

34
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,689
or whatever that kind of thing they will

35
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,590
have psi ratings well the atmosphere

36
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:38,219
could be measured in psi and so if you

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,229
go to the sea sea level the air pressure

38
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,499
is pretty close to 15 pounds per square

39
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,969
inch so think about what that means that

40
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:47,939
means if you're standing at the ocean

41
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:51,689
for every square inch on your body

42
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,810
you've got 15 pounds pushing so the

43
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,700
question is why don't we notice this

44
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,919
right so if I take my hand anything well

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,520
okay how many square inches could you

46
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:05,639
draw on your hand so I don't know let's

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,310
just say six okay I can draw six square

48
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:11,520
inches on my hand right so if I hold it

49
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,760
out that means I have 15 pounds roughly

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,959
on every one of those

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,989
six square inches less ninety pounds so

52
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,400
how is it possible I can just do this

53
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:25,959
right it's like it's no big deal

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,480
and I really don't feel anything

55
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:32,299
so the answer this think about what it's

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,580
like to be in deep water see if you've

57
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:37,610
ever died of deep let's say you go down

58
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,049
to the deep end of a pool let's say you

59
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,650
had somebody that you could like sit on

60
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:45,260
the bottom of the deep end of the pool

61
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,660
what you would notice is that the air or

62
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,829
sorry the water pressure is confining

63
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,049
you from all directions but all the

64
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:56,000
water was above your head so in other

65
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,709
words you don't feel the the water from

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,859
the swimming pool pushing down on your

67
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,200
head only it's all around you it's a

68
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:05,329
fluid well the atmosphere is also a

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,760
fluid and it behaves in a similar way so

70
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,269
I hold my hand out yes I have

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,819
whatever was ninety pounds pushing down

72
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:17,209
but I also have ninety pounds pushing up

73
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:20,419
and those two forces cancel each other

74
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,950
out and I don't notice a thing so this

75
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:24,230
is the thing that kind of takes a little

76
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,200
bit getting used to all the atmospheres

77
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,870
above my hand right it's all above my

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,060
all the atmospheres up there but the

79
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,299
force pushing down from above is the

80
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,819
same as the force pushing up from below

81
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:40,880
that's the nature of a fluid okay so

82
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,530
most of the time we don't notice air

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,959
pressure unless there's some weird

84
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:50,299
imbalance of it now psi use four tires

85
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,030
on toys but turns out we generally don't

86
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:56,540
use it for weather okay we have a couple

87
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,519
other ones that we use instead now to

88
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,180
get to some of the new or the other

89
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,910
units that we use so as you know if you

90
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,940
have a fluid and you have a straw and

91
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:11,269
you create a vacuum right you suck air

92
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,489
out of the straw that liquid will go up

93
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,199
the straw right and then you've probably

94
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:16,970
done thing we suck on a little bit and

95
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,919
put your thumb over it and it'll stay

96
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,959
there right because you've made a vacuum

97
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,090
in here you've made there's less air

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,440
pressure in here and that will suck up

99
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:31,580
the liquid right okay well

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,250
for many years engineers are trying to

101
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:38,750
figure out how do we get water up a

102
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,610
multi-story building right so this was

103
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,530
years before electricity and they were

104
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,440
trying to figure out if we had it we if

105
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,080
we had a cistern sitting down here water

106
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,220
tank couldn't we put like a really tall

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,580
pipe in suck it up right couldn't we do

108
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,820
that so they tried this and it turns out

109
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,460
that no matter how hard you try you

110
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,940
cannot suck water up more than about 34

111
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,620
feet from where it originated from and

112
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,360
it doesn't matter you could have a

113
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,970
thousand people all sucking on this

114
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,190
straw and it will not go beyond 34 feet

115
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,750
of course they weren't actually using

116
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,540
humans to suck they were trying to make

117
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,920
a machine that would act as a vacuum

118
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,570
pump that would suck the water out and

119
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,190
they found well that's weird doesn't

120
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,820
matter what we do we just can't get

121
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,660
beyond 34 feet now this was a this

122
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,670
problem had been known for a while but

123
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:35,690
here's a weird thing when they did this

124
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:38,090
and not only did it stay if it's 34 feet

125
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:41,210
mark but they also noticed that the

126
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:44,900
exact level kind of changed a little bit

127
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,850
with the weather and so if it was sunny

128
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,120
clear day it seemed to be a little bit

129
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,590
higher and if it was a cloudy rainy day

130
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,610
it seemed to be a little bit lower so

131
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,650
they lost that's kind of weird now this

132
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,470
was a problem that had vexed people for

133
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,290
a long long time because one of the

134
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,080
biggest problems that still actually

135
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,270
faces miners today but especially in the

136
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,900
ancient times is if you dig a deep

137
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,640
underground mine it can easily get

138
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,440
filled with water right groundwater

139
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,090
comes in here and that's a problem

140
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,280
because you're trying to dig out the ore

141
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,430
but it keeps filling up with water so

142
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,330
for a long time like hundreds of years

143
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,370
people have been trying to figure out

144
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,180
how do you get water up out of the hole

145
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:33,669
and so they've been trying different

146
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:37,460
vacuum techniques to do this so 1600s

147
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:40,610
torch Shelley was a scientist and he was

148
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,330
trying to figure this out you know why

149
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,669
is this the

150
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,889
four-foot women why does this happen and

151
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,439
as he was messing around with this he

152
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:51,289
figured out that you know you know it's

153
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:54,139
difficult to have a 34-foot pipe with

154
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:55,699
water in it to experiment in the lab but

155
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,009
what you could do is even if you had a

156
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,560
denser liquid you could kind of shrink

157
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,300
the whole thing down and so he found the

158
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,969
densest liquid he could find which is

159
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,009
mercury and he found out that if you

160
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:09,590
took mercury and he filled up a tube

161
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,330
that's closed on one end and he tipped

162
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,000
it upside down and he put it into a bowl

163
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,520
of mercury and he let his thumb off that

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,479
the mercury would fall down a certain

165
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,909
amount okay and now at the time they

166
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,849
didn't understand anything about air or

167
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,169
air pressure they think arum or had any

168
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,389
pressure and he didn't know what a

169
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,550
vacuum was but this little experiment

170
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,259
proved that actually you can make a

171
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,039
vacuum there's no way air could have

172
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:40,069
gotten into this little hole and let me

173
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,990
just point out that scientists were

174
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,969
balling back there look at that look at

175
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:50,539
that outfit I wish we were still wearing

176
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:52,940
that today so Tortelli fills this tube

177
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,990
with mercury dish with mercury says his

178
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,550
buddies got the earth through there's

179
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,020
liquid mercury sitting in this bowl and

180
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:02,469
he's holding this glass tube here and

181
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,900
what happens is the atmospheric pressure

182
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:08,050
pushes down on the surface of mercury

183
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,490
pushes it up the tube to a certain level

184
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,500
okay so this was the first time that

185
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,050
anybody realized that the atmosphere

186
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,349
actually has pressure now the other

187
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,990
thing that he noticed just like the guys

188
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,029
that were trying to suck water up to the

189
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,159
top of the building is that the height

190
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,680
of this would change a little bit with

191
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,879
the weather so I got sunny this little

192
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,699
column of mercury got a little bit

193
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,130
higher and it was cloudy he got a little

194
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,959
bit less and the really weird thing is

195
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,839
it seemed to be able to predict the

196
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:42,829
weather so if he saw it starting to

197
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,649
climb then he knew it's going to be

198
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:47,630
sunny weather and if it started to fall

199
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:51,020
started to go down he knew it's going to

200
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:54,300
be stormy weather now this freaked a lot

201
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,190
of people out and and Tortelli is

202
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,050
temper with Galileo these two guys knew

203
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,700
each other and they are experimenting

204
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,260
with this in total secret because they

205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,570
figured out anybody saw this they'd be

206
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,800
accused of witchcraft it was freaking

207
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,450
them out too like they couldn't figure

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,700
out how in the world can this thing

209
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:13,459
predict the weather but it seemed to be

210
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:16,620
able to do it and so what he had

211
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:18,600
inverting Lee invented in this

212
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,149
experimentation was something that we

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,779
now call the barometer and the barometer

214
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:26,339
works at least the version he made is so

215
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,579
here's the Tortelli barometer he got a

216
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:31,500
pool mercury and you got the tube

217
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:36,149
atmospheric pushes down pushes it up the

218
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,829
tube and you have this column and so the

219
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,470
way they would measure the air pressure

220
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:44,430
is that they would measure the height of

221
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:48,029
this column from down here so if the air

222
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,980
pressure increases that more mercury

223
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:52,440
gets shoved up the tube if the air

224
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,720
pressure decreases less mercury gets

225
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,510
shoved up the tube and the column Falls

226
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,880
and so what do they do they measure this

227
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:06,930
distance in inches or in millimeters so

228
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,350
a unit of air pressure became inches of

229
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,149
mercury or millimeters of mercury and

230
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,940
that was just this height that's what

231
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:18,690
that was the the unit that they've

232
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,140
figured out now over time people dropped

233
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,870
the words of mercury so it became

234
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,760
millimeters or it became inches so an

235
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,940
air pressure reading might say 30

236
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,959
point-0 six inches and that you just

237
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,399
have to know that's what they're talking

238
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,820
about they're talking about inches of

239
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,980
mercury in this barometer well the

240
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,370
problem with this setup as I've showed

241
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,260
you you know if I torch all we didn't

242
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,140
know this but you never want to touch

243
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:49,380
mercury okay it's extremely poisonous if

244
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,329
it touches your skin that's bad news but

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,070
even like in this instrument these got

246
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,860
there's a there's open mercury in this

247
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,360
bowl and mercury actually evaporates and

248
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,190
mercury vapors are extremely poisonous

249
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,520
to cause brain cancer all kinds of

250
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:05,399
trouble so an actual mercury barometer

251
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,380
this is what one looks like and they've

252
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,990
got it all kind of covered in glass too

253
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,840
the mercury vapors to come out but it's

254
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,880
not something you want in your house and

255
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,830
so over time people figured out other

256
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,710
ways to do this otherwise to measure air

257
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,130
pressure and today we don't use mercury

258
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:25,950
we don't have columns of mercury but we

259
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:29,940
still use the Union inches so here's a

260
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,620
more modern barometer and it says inches

261
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,980
right there and then you can see the

262
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,910
numbers 29 30 31

263
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:41,160
so this dial tells you how many inches a

264
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,050
mercury barometer would be if you had

265
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,440
one right but nobody uses them anymore

266
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,780
so this inches is a as a holdover from

267
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,310
an ancient time that you know we don't

268
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,250
use mercury barometers we haven't used

269
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,140
them for over a hundred years and you

270
00:11:53,250 --> 00:12:01,190
find one in the museum maybe but that's

271
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:05,100
it so a more modern unit that we use

272
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:07,590
besides inches is something called

273
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,690
millibars and sometimes that's

274
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:12,930
abbreviated mb or sometimes it's

275
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,030
abbreviated as mb AR and then there's

276
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,050
another one that's called hectopascals

277
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,450
HPA

278
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,280
and this gets really confusing I don't

279
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,770
want to get too deep into this a

280
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,820
millibar and a hectopascal are the same

281
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,680
thing they're just different units in

282
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,470
this class we're going to I'm just going

283
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,800
to be using the word millibar so in this

284
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:37,170
in this barometer right here says mbar

285
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,860
and you see the numbers that go from 950

286
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,000
all the way around to 1070 right the

287
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,170
ones on the outside so those are

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,490
millibars it's very difficult to

289
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,110
visualize a middle bar and it's a

290
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,050
mathematical thing we're not going to

291
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,450
get into it so all I'm gonna say is that

292
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,440
at sea level there's about a thousand

293
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,070
thirteen middle bars

294
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,230
okay and that's going to have to do for

295
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,050
this class because we can't get into

296
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,410
exactly what a middle bar is so here's

297
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,870
another barometer this is using using HP

298
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,220
a hectopascals which again for this

299
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,080
class it's the same thing as a middle

300
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,730
bar okay just another way of writing it

301
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,779
and again you see the numbers are in the

302
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,790
nine hundreds to the low thousands

303
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,800
so because air pressure varies with

304
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,300
Heights we could write out what the air

305
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,970
pressures would be at some different

306
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,339
locations on earth so at sea level so

307
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,980
you for a San Francisco like we already

308
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:34,720
said it's about 14.7 PSI turns out

309
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,519
that's pretty close to 30 inches of

310
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,339
mercury if you're using the Tortelli

311
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,879
barometer in millibars that's a thousand

312
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,800
thirteen okay so as you go up up to

313
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:47,470
albuquerque our pressure is about twelve

314
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,839
psi which is about twenty four and a

315
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,939
half or so inches of mercury and about

316
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,949
eight hundred and thirty-four millibars

317
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:57,009
you get to the top of Sandia Crest

318
00:13:53,949 --> 00:14:00,399
you're below 10 inches of sorry well 10

319
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:02,379
psi you're 20 inches of mercury 678

320
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,300
millibars if you want all the way that

321
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:06,819
the top of Mount Everest at 30,000 feet

322
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,920
or so it's about four and a half PSI in

323
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:12,939
your less than 10 inches of mercury and

324
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,100
300 millibars so as you go up no matter

325
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:21,040
how you measure the amount of air

326
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:22,839
pressure decreases now the thing is we

327
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,170
see these big changes in the air

328
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,269
pressure from elevation and that's true

329
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,819
but that's not actually what we're

330
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:34,269
interested in what we're interested in

331
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:36,519
is that these values actually change a

332
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:38,319
little bit with the weather so this is

333
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,939
what we're talking about with Tortelli

334
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:42,220
and galileo looking at that we'll call

335
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:44,470
moving up and down like it's telling us

336
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,360
something about the atmosphere so these

337
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,819
numbers are average values so in

338
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,100
albuquerque or average values 834

339
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,620
millibars but it goes up a few more bars

340
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,209
it goes down a few millibars and that's

341
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:01,990
what we're interested in is that little

342
00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:04,029
change so why would it change well if

343
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,040
you want if you remember way back in the

344
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,499
lecture on clouds we talked about how

345
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,839
the atmosphere is divided into two parts

346
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:15,040
that we talked about the troposphere in

347
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,559
the stratosphere winds that are way up

348
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,329
in the upper part of the troposphere up

349
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:22,420
by what we called the tropopause if you

350
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:25,389
remember that they sometimes come

351
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,879
together and converge and if they do it

352
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:30,220
turns out that air when it crashes into

353
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,670
each other for reasons we haven't really

354
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,890
got into yet but what we

355
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,820
later it can't really go up into the

356
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,070
stratosphere instead it goes down so

357
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,710
when winds up here converge and when

358
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,570
this word aloft that just means up above

359
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:48,260
our heads winds aloft are the winds up

360
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:50,390
up there when they converge that forces

361
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,820
air to go down well when you force air

362
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:55,820
to go down it compresses and when you

363
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,500
compress air at worm's well what happens

364
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,250
when you have a column of compressing

365
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,500
warming air well that air is very

366
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,720
difficult to form clouds in remember for

367
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,430
clouds we want air to rise and this air

368
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,860
is sinking it's going the wrong way and

369
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,890
it's getting warmer and we need air to

370
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,650
get cooler so cloud formation is very

371
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,000
unlikely and if you remember from the

372
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,560
convection lecture we talked about

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,160
stable and unstable air

374
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,140
this makes stable air so all of this is

375
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,150
to say that when this whole thing you

376
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,610
know when these winds off converge all

377
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,270
these things happen and you as a person

378
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,220
on the ground

379
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,680
notice that the air pressure has

380
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,500
increased so if you get the Tortelli

381
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,040
barometer when this is happening up here

382
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,320
the the column of mercury is rising and

383
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,170
so there's a they talk about the

384
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,330
barometer rising that means that column

385
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,240
is going up even though we don't use

386
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,640
mercury today we still use that term the

387
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,460
barometer is rising when this process is

388
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,720
happening now on a map what we would do

389
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:03,010
is we would draw a big H on the map to

390
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,690
represent the center of high pressure

391
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,510
now in my drawing here this looks really

392
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,850
small that's misleading this process

393
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,250
this thing is calm air it's going to be

394
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:17,020
the size of several states big States

395
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,020
I'll show you that in a little bit now

396
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:22,430
maybe the winds aloft will diverge so

397
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,110
this is the opposite so instead of

398
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,330
moving together on a collision course

399
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,800
they tend to diverge apart from each

400
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,930
other and that essentially kind of

401
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,020
creates a vacuum there's a lack of air

402
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:36,380
here and so what happens is air rises up

403
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:39,680
from the surface to replace the vacuum

404
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,200
that's being created well whenever air

405
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,210
rises it expands and expanding air cools

406
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,039
and what we've said before

407
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,350
is that that's what you need to make

408
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,960
clouds right you want air to rise

409
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:55,470
expands it cools you hit the dew point

410
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,140
you get a cloud this is what contributes

411
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,730
to unstable air okay so whenever you

412
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,159
have this whole process of winds

413
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,990
diverging aloft air is rising you're

414
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,120
making clouds are making unstable air

415
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,370
and it's kind of like a giant vacuum

416
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,830
cleaner above your head that's sucking

417
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,010
air up away from you you will notice

418
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,510
that the air pressure down here

419
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,520
decreases now it's not like there's a

420
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,120
literal wind flying up from the ground

421
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,679
it's much more subtle than that but if

422
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,809
you got one of those barometers you'll

423
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,029
notice that the air pressure is going

424
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:29,700
down when this process is happening and

425
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,980
so on a weather map will put a big L to

426
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,919
represent a lower center of low pressure

427
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,929
and again this process is much larger

428
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:42,450
than this diagram implies so on a

429
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:46,679
weather map we will plot HS and LS to

430
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:49,409
kind of look like this so from this we

431
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,870
know several things now how would you

432
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:55,020
predict the weather say right here in

433
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,330
Colorado well there's a low there so we

434
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,700
know the air is rising we know rising

435
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,010
air is conducive to cloud formation so

436
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,690
it's probably cloudy here we don't have

437
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,490
enough information to know if it's

438
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,929
raining or not but we have a pretty good

439
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,020
chance that the Daley's to have cloudy

440
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:12,090
skies okay what's the air here doing the

441
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,190
air here is sinking so what's their

442
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,649
weather like probably clear skies

443
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,799
sinking air the air sinking warming and

444
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:21,690
it's making stable air you can't really

445
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:27,120
make convection so they probably have

446
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:29,820
clear skies now there is a couple other

447
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,549
ways besides the two I just talked about

448
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,010
to make highs and lows if you have

449
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,870
somewhere that's really warm and warm

450
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,179
air rises so here we are out in the

451
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,330
tropics and we've got poems of warm air

452
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:45,149
rising from the ocean going up and

453
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:49,740
making you know cumulonimbus clouds then

454
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:51,570
as you bring air up off the surface you

455
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,450
are lowering the pressure at the surface

456
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,460
and this is called a thermal low so

457
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,480
places are really hot like Arizona in

458
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,430
the summer we'll have thermal

459
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,260
so this is a different way to make a

460
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:05,560
low-pressure anytime you have air that's

461
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:10,300
rising from heat or convection you will

462
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:12,040
get a low at the surface and then

463
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,130
there's also another way to make a

464
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:18,430
high-pressure and you can get this and

465
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:21,340
really really cold places so if you have

466
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:23,380
a blob of really cold air that comes in

467
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,600
over the continent in a classic example

468
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,300
of Siberia right you're up in northern

469
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,240
Russia and there's really cold lava air

470
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,810
comes down and settles over the land

471
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:38,140
really cold air contracts and as it

472
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:40,660
contracts in shrinks more air kind of

473
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,310
fills in above it and what happens from

474
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,290
that is the person that's sitting down

475
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,740
on the ground in that really cold air

476
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,150
will notice the air pressure goes up

477
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,060
you're kind of like piling more and more

478
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,950
air on the surface and because it

479
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,840
shrinks when it's cold it'll let you

480
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,570
pile more on top and pretty soon you got

481
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,340
a high pressure at the surface so this

482
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:04,960
is sometimes called a cold high or cold

483
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:08,800
core high now we can look for some of

484
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,260
these features so here I am at the web

485
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,900
site we've been to before earth nil

486
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,570
Schoolnet and so by default that's

487
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,400
showing you wind and what I'm gonna do

488
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,370
is click the word earth and hang on the

489
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,050
click on MSL P and that's for mean sea

490
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,470
level pressure and this is going to show

491
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,030
us

492
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:31,540
air pressure along the earth now here's

493
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:34,780
the scale the colors the widest white

494
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:39,550
colors are the highest air pressure and

495
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,140
then well rare pressure is is the yellow

496
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,630
and then the really low pressure gets

497
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,660
into blue and then even lower than that

498
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:50,290
enter into red ok so let's look around

499
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,940
here now as we look around we can see

500
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,020
like for example here's this big purple

501
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,480
blob this is an area of low pressure so

502
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:02,080
that tells us air here must be rising

503
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,590
okay air here must be rising and if I

504
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,380
look at the United States today I see

505
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,540
that whitish color right there so that's

506
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,600
high pressure so we know that air must

507
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,550
be sinking right there

508
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,440
okay so all every purple blob you see is

509
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,060
a place where air is rising every white

510
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,450
blob you see like here's a big one out

511
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:26,890
in the ocean where air is sinking okay

512
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:29,140
now I'm going to change the overlay to

513
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,600
temp for temperature and this is surface

514
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,340
temperature okay so now the colors mean

515
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:39,370
temperature I want to go over here to

516
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:42,160
our friends in Siberia and notice how

517
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,710
yet this is a big blob a ruby cold air

518
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,390
that's sitting over the continent right

519
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,680
now so that purple that's really cold

520
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,020
air that's coming down from the North

521
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,860
Pole alright I'm going to switch it to

522
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:56,370
MS LP again for sea level pressure you

523
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,170
notice that this whole blob is now white

524
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,960
that is that tells us that's high

525
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:05,050
pressure this is an example of a cold

526
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,420
core hi so this is a high pressure due

527
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,950
to really cold air that sunk down again

528
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:14,530
from the North Pole and it settles over

529
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:17,500
the Asian continent or we go down to the

530
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,690
equator and notice that I've got some

531
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,840
dark purple there but I also kind of

532
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,720
have a general purple hue all the way

533
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,350
across here see that right through there

534
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,000
so that is a thermal low right through

535
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,030
in the middle of the Equator it's so

536
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,970
warm and it's so humid you have constant

537
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:39,520
cumulonimbus in this area every day and

538
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,110
that means air is rising and that

539
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,880
creates a low pressure at the surface

540
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,400
this is a thermal low kind of right

541
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,500
through there we see again over here

542
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,790
kind of goes through Central Africa it's

543
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,110
pretty close to the equator right there

544
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,240
is the equator right so it's kind of

545
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,000
around there and then over here kind of

546
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,810
does something different so that is a

547
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,170
thermal low this was a cold core high

548
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:03,250
and then each one of these little blobs

549
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,770
there's something happening in the

550
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,900
atmosphere where we got air converging

551
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,780
or diverging aloft which is either

552
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:14,320
making air rise or sink in the

553
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,740
atmosphere so what air pressure were

554
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,480
interested in the changes due to weather

555
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,540
but the problem is the changes due to

556
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,860
elevation are far far greater so imagine

557
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,190
we've got three cities here at San

558
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,490
Francisco Albuquerque

559
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,650
in Leadville Colorado and San Francisco

560
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,690
being at sea level is going to average a

561
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:35,350
thousand thirteen millibars plus or

562
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,880
minus a few millibars with the weather

563
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,180
but we are going to be like 834

564
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,680
millibars plus or minus a few and

565
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,180
Leadville Colorado being a thousand over

566
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,100
ten thousand feet up it's going to be at

567
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,650
six ninety two plus or minus a few so

568
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,410
here's the problem no matter what

569
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:54,230
happens to San Francisco's weather they

570
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,090
will never ever get air pressure as low

571
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,070
as ours and no matter what happens to

572
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,710
our weather we'll never get an air

573
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,380
pressure as high as theirs

574
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,520
so it's really hard to compare numbers

575
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,810
because we're all at different

576
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,880
elevations so how do we resolve this

577
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,460
well one solution would be well what if

578
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,980
we had everybody on the continent drill

579
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,690
down to sea level right they just

580
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,010
drilled a deep hole and they put the

581
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,080
barometer at the bottom of the hole

582
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,390
right then everybody's got a barometer

583
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,810
at sea level okay then we could compare

584
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:29,750
numbers that would work but it would be

585
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:32,080
kind of hard to pull off so what we do

586
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:35,360
instead is we can actually

587
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,980
mathematically correct for elevation now

588
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,210
we're not going to do that in this class

589
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,180
we're not going to do the math someone

590
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,010
else is going to do that for us but the

591
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,380
convention when we talk about air

592
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,470
pressure and this is kind of a worldwide

593
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:51,740
convention is we report the air pressure

594
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,530
as if we were at sea level so what

595
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,840
happens is they take a pressure reading

596
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,330
say at the Albuquerque Airport and they

597
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,160
calculate okay what would it be at sea

598
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,250
level if we were at sea level and they

599
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,620
mathematically subtract out the effect

600
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:10,400
for our elevation and that's the number

601
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:13,610
that gets reported so when you check the

602
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,150
weather so here I'm at weather.gov this

603
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:19,280
is where your tax dollars go to for the

604
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,350
best possible weather prediction they're

605
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,810
way better than any kind of other

606
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:27,680
weather service out there and you look

607
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:29,390
at so so if you go there you go click to

608
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,360
wherever you live in here I'm at

609
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:35,360
Albuquerque's Airport and so here's a

610
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,300
reading so as things on here we know now

611
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,720
right humidity is 29% okay what humanity

612
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,970
is

613
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,380
that well because it's a number between

614
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,820
zero and a hundred percent I know that

615
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,010
has to be relative humidity right

616
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,169
there's our dew point so we've talked

617
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:51,020
about that notice this so here's

618
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,669
barometer thirty point zero eight inches

619
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,580
and then the parentheses a thousand

620
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:58,190
fifteen point five Nilla

621
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:01,700
so thirty point zero eight inches means

622
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:04,309
that if we were at sea level which were

623
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,950
not and if we had an old mercury

624
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,990
barometer which we don't and we set it

625
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,090
up this is what we would measure that

626
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,850
thirty point zero eight inches of

627
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:17,090
mercury and then in a more modern unit a

628
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:20,000
thousand fifteen point five millimeter

629
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,950
value valid if we drill down to sea

630
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,289
level here at Albuquerque that's what

631
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,809
the air pressure would be so that's how

632
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:29,059
it's reported so we call this sea level

633
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,590
pressure right and everybody reports

634
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:34,880
their barometers as sea level pressure

635
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,950
so after thousands of air pressure

636
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,510
measurements are taking from thousands

637
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,909
of weather stations all across North

638
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,850
America and we mathematically correct

639
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,590
each of those for elevation then we plot

640
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,270
the results on the map that kind of

641
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,940
looks like this this is called a

642
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:54,820
sea-level pressure map and a sea level

643
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:57,080
level pressure map so before we continue

644
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,030
if you're one of my current students I

645
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,039
have this posted on learn there's three

646
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,049
pages you might want to print these out

647
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,730
before we start if you're coming here

648
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,200
from somewhere else on the internet I

649
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:11,240
have these on my website if you want to

650
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,370
download those so there are three pages

651
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,080
and numbered one two three we're going

652
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,360
to start with page number one know the

653
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:23,020
bottom it says sea-level pressure map

654
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:25,700
for one 116 okay so first thing is that

655
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:29,690
there are these numbers ten twenty ten

656
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:32,360
twenty five 10:30 10:35 those are sea

657
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:34,580
level pressure contours so these are

658
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,179
contour lines and the way you would read

659
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:41,690
this is that if you were to walk right

660
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:44,120
along this line on this day in you're at

661
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,429
sea level which are not but if you were

662
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,770
that the air pressure would be ten

663
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:52,250
thirty millibars all these are in

664
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:53,840
millibars they don't say that now each

665
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,240
these contours is the same way if you

666
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,060
walk along these contours you will be

667
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,490
exactly at that pressure indicated by

668
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,350
the number and as long as you stay at

669
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,030
along that line and if you're at sea

670
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:09,350
level that's what the air pressure would

671
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:11,870
be so if I were to walk say this way

672
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:14,510
okay start in southern Texas I walk

673
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:18,520
north what I would notice is that the

674
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:23,510
air pressure is increasing 10:25 10:30

675
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:28,520
10:35 10:40 right or if I start up here

676
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:30,710
in the North 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 there

677
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,230
increasing towards the center of this

678
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,540
big blob here and in fact right in the

679
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:40,610
middle this is the highest pressure of

680
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:43,490
the whole region this 1040 contour so no

681
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:47,000
matter which way I go air pressure is

682
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:52,400
increasing towards this region so I'm

683
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:56,570
gonna put a big H right here for a

684
00:29:52,400 --> 00:30:02,390
center of high pressure okay now what

685
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:05,780
that means is that this whole blob is a

686
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,160
blob of sinking air okay so to relate it

687
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,590
to something we talked about a few

688
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,270
minutes ago I had a diagram of a person

689
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,850
standing on the ground and air is

690
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:16,250
sinking above their head and I said at

691
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,280
the time that it's much bigger than this

692
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:21,560
diagram would have you believe this is

693
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,870
what I mean this thing is huge right it

694
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,510
covers all of the western United States

695
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,340
and parts of Canada this is a big blob

696
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,050
of sinking air so there's air coming

697
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,930
down from the upper part of the

698
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:35,570
atmosphere squishing out here so we

699
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:38,390
could say a few things about their

700
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:41,510
weather right now high pressure that

701
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,630
probably clear skies right it's stable

702
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:48,320
air we know that another thing that we

703
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:52,340
can tell from this on this map notice

704
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,680
how if I look at this part I have if I

705
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:59,360
were to walk this direction the numbers

706
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:01,760
increase so 10 15 20 25 30 35 and then

707
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,480
if I walk this direction the numbers

708
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,330
decrease okay so it's analogous

709
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,220
to a mountain on the topographic map so

710
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,140
topographic map would have contours

711
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,299
except they mean elevation I'd be

712
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,340
walking up the hill and then be walking

713
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:18,710
down the hill okay so on a topographic

714
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,710
map this feature right here would be a

715
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,570
ridge this is not topographic map it's

716
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,730
air pressure but we still call it a

717
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,160
ridge it's called a ridge of high

718
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:31,040
pressure and I just bring this up

719
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,890
because this term ridge ridge of high

720
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,720
pressure is used in meteorology and in

721
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,059
weather reports you might hear it use

722
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,230
something like this though it might say

723
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,840
there's a ridge of high pressure

724
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,919
building over the Four Corners area over

725
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,660
the next several days

726
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,330
what does that mean that means that

727
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,669
there's a high pressure center high

728
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,830
pressure system centered over the Four

729
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:53,530
Corners area and it's getting stronger

730
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:58,970
and stronger for the next several days

731
00:31:53,530 --> 00:32:01,549
so when you hear ridge just think high

732
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,679
pressure so even on a map that you know

733
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:05,750
like this one even if you don't really

734
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,210
see this particular feature it doesn't

735
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:11,049
matter a ridge is just a blob of high

736
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:14,060
pressure it's a big blob of sinking air

737
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,929
okay let's go to the second page so

738
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:20,030
[Applause]

739
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:23,660
here's the second page and it says

740
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:27,049
sea-level pressure may have to 25 16 all

741
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:34,549
right so let's start on the in the West

742
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:36,950
and we see 10 17 20 22 25 27 30 numbers

743
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:39,830
a getting larger towards this blob here

744
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,960
or if I go from the south 25 27 30

745
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:46,610
they're getting larger towards this blob

746
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:49,280
so locally this is a higher pressure

747
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,850
than anything else so I'm gonna put an H

748
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:55,250
here okay

749
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:57,290
now let's look over here

750
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:05,240
and we've got this weird bullseye

751
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:10,010
pattern and I've got numbers 10 17 12 10

752
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:12,169
7 5 2 0 9 9 7 5 they're getting lower

753
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,030
towards the center of this bullseye

754
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:15,860
pattern or if I go from this direction

755
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,380
they're getting lower towards the center

756
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,330
so if I walk towards the

757
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,300
center of this bullseye pressure is

758
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,400
going down so this is a center of low

759
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,480
pressure and I put my L right in the

760
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,880
center of that thing right there so we

761
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,700
have in the country on this particular

762
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,030
day we have a blob of air that's sinking

763
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:40,190
down squishing out on the ground on this

764
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,200
part making high pressure and then we

765
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,870
have the blob of air that's rising up

766
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,760
and so we can say a few things about the

767
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,890
weather right we can say that well over

768
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:53,350
here they probably have clear skies

769
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:56,600
stable air over here they've got

770
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:59,120
definitely cloudy in effect this is a

771
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,980
pretty severe storm system here and I

772
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,020
say that because there's so many of

773
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,550
these pressure contour lines pretty

774
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,670
close together this is a pretty strong

775
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:10,070
storm so all we can gather from what

776
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:12,409
we've talked about so far is that this

777
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,470
is rising air this is sinking air here

778
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:17,330
is probably cloudy here is probably

779
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:19,340
clear beyond that we don't have enough

780
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,879
information yet to say more whether it's

781
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:27,530
raining or anything like that okay let's

782
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,040
move on to number three okay so the

783
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:34,730
first thing I'm going to do is identify

784
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:42,350
highs and lows and so if I look over

785
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:43,850
here to the east I see thousand twelve

786
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,590
thousand ten thousand seven thousand

787
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,899
five thousand two and there was a

788
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:55,520
getting smaller towards that bull's eye

789
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:58,130
so that is going to be low here now our

790
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,570
highs are not as quickly defined there's

791
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,100
one over here and the numbers are kind

792
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,290
of cut off so it's a little hard to see

793
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:06,020
but ten thousand I'm sorry thousand

794
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,640
seventeen thousand twenty it's cut off

795
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,650
thousand twenty two point five but

796
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,730
that's a high over there I'm just going

797
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:16,370
to put that on there out of there over

798
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:18,470
the ocean there's a kind of a small high

799
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,740
over Mexico so this is thousand

800
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:23,120
seventeen and a half thousand twenty

801
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,510
that one doesn't have a number but

802
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,210
there's our high right here there's

803
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:31,790
another little high sitting kind of over

804
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,339
the Four Corners area so this thousand

805
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,239
twenty is

806
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:40,259
bigger than anything around it so

807
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:42,420
there's a high okay now the reason I

808
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:44,099
have this map is because I want you to

809
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,829
pay attention to what's happening kind

810
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:53,069
of in the middle here of the country

811
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:55,799
these numbers 17 15 12 and a half 1075 -

812
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:57,749
so these numbers are decreasing towards

813
00:35:55,799 --> 00:36:01,099
the north okay the pressures are

814
00:35:57,749 --> 00:36:07,739
decreasing towards this blob up here

815
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:09,809
this up here is a low and we actually

816
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:12,359
the map has been cut off so that we

817
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:14,549
don't actually see you know these

818
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:16,049
contour lines don't wrap around there

819
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:17,759
they're there somewhere up here in

820
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:20,640
Canada but we don't see them because

821
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:25,319
this is where the map ends but notice

822
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,650
that in our country how you've got these

823
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:32,339
u shapes right these u shapes come down

824
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:34,710
and kind of like we were talking about a

825
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:38,519
ridge this thing if this is a

826
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:41,579
topographic map would be a trough if I

827
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:43,170
walk if this was elevation and I was

828
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:46,440
walking across here I'd be going down

829
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,029
down down down down and then up up up up

830
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,900
back out of it so this would be like a

831
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:56,160
valley or a ditch so this thing on a

832
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:59,609
weather map is called a trough and a

833
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,400
trough is connected as these u shapes

834
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:04,859
that are connected to a low so the the

835
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,509
center of the low may not even where I

836
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:08,849
drew it may be similar to the North here

837
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:12,930
as it's off the map but that's pretty

838
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:16,890
common so a lot of times where we live

839
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:18,630
for example our weather map may be cut

840
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,059
off like this and that's all we see and

841
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:24,359
we don't know what's above here but we

842
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,829
see that we have these u shapes and we

843
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,849
see that the numbers are getting smaller

844
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:29,190
towards the middle

845
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:33,900
that's called it a trough of low

846
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:36,989
pressure so kind of like Ridge it means

847
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:40,999
high pressure in weather speak trough

848
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:43,289
means low pressure so when you hear

849
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:45,500
weather report and they talk about a

850
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:48,530
trough of low pressure moving across

851
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,750
the country what they are saying is that

852
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,150
there is a little pressure center that's

853
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:56,210
moving across the country the center of

854
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,030
the low may not be in the country in our

855
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:02,330
country itself it may be to the north

856
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:05,420
but it still has the same effect as the

857
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:08,240
low so this trough as it moves across

858
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,550
the United States air is rising in the

859
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,650
trough so you've got cloud formation in

860
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:15,260
the trough so in your mind when you hear

861
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:17,330
trough or trough of low pressure just

862
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,140
think it's a low it's a low pressure

863
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:23,000
center moving across the country okay so

864
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,760
now we're going to return to Earth Knoll

865
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,410
Schoolnet and I'm looking again mean sea

866
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,190
level pressure I did that by clicking

867
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,700
earth and MSL P so the purple is low

868
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,880
pressure

869
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:37,609
the white is high pressure and I'm going

870
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,580
to zoom in here and the spot out in the

871
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:43,180
ocean that's that's a high and I want

872
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,890
you to notice what the winds are doing

873
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:51,040
so the winds are spinning around in a

874
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:54,650
circle right and they're going clockwise

875
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,369
now right next to it is this low

876
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:00,730
pressure this blob and notice that the

877
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:02,930
winds are spinning counterclockwise

878
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,900
here's another little purple blob

879
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:09,440
another low pressure winds are spinning

880
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,480
counterclockwise and that's the pattern

881
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,910
that you'll notice here let's find

882
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,440
another one here's another high out in

883
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:21,920
the ocean clockwise here's another big

884
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,080
low will pressure this was a little

885
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,940
harder to see but overall it's going

886
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,740
counterclockwise alright now this

887
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,740
pattern is consistent throughout the

888
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:37,550
northern hemisphere if I have a high I

889
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,530
have air circulating clockwise if I have

890
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:44,000
a low of air circulating

891
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:45,320
counterclockwise you know go down here

892
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,660
let's see what's happening in the

893
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,210
southern hemisphere so in the southern

894
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,250
hemisphere I've got a bunch of little

895
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:57,500
pressure centers down here by Antarctica

896
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:59,840
but notice this low spinning clockwise

897
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,540
here's a low clockwise here's a low

898
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,720
clockwise that's the opposite of what we

899
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:11,810
just saw or over here here's a high that

900
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:14,720
white spot counterclockwise so there is

901
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,940
a rule regarding the winds around highs

902
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,560
and lows but it depends on what

903
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:23,720
hemisphere you're in so if you're in the

904
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,410
southern hemisphere wind goes

905
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,300
counterclockwise around a high and

906
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,460
clockwise around a low if you're in the

907
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,250
northern hemisphere it goes clockwise

908
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,910
around a high counterclockwise around a

909
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:43,010
low okay so why is this well this has to

910
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:44,750
do with the famous Coriolis effect so to

911
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,460
explain the Coriolis effect let's

912
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,800
consider what would happen if the earth

913
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:51,050
did not spin if the earth did not spin

914
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,270
then air would want to move directly

915
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,060
from a high to a low in a straight line

916
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:59,109
okay so any winds that we would have

917
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:01,670
would be directly between highs and lows

918
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:05,150
but that's not what we observe on earth

919
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:08,119
what we observe is that winds in the

920
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:11,240
northern hemisphere are deflected to the

921
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:14,359
right so the winds trying to move from

922
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,910
high to low but it can't ever get there

923
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:18,950
because it's always being moved to the

924
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,710
right it ends up going in a big circle

925
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,869
around the high in a clockwise fashion

926
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,099
in the northern hemisphere or

927
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:28,460
counterclockwise in the southern

928
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:32,599
hemisphere so they try to explain this I

929
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:35,180
have one little demo here and what we're

930
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,950
looking at so imagine this is the earth

931
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,170
and we're looking straight down the

932
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:41,420
North Pole right so if I have wind

933
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:45,260
that's moving from the North Pole to the

934
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,490
equator in the earth did not spin wind

935
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,220
is trying to move in a straight line

936
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:51,170
like this right okay but now let's

937
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:55,099
imagine that the earth is spinning and

938
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:57,320
the earth spins counterclockwise on as

939
00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:00,380
you look from the from the perspective

940
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:05,930
of the North Pole right so now if I move

941
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:10,680
my my wind in a straight line kind of

942
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:12,840
clumsy but what I see is that my wind

943
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,210
when the winds perspective is moving as

944
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,730
making a big right-hand turn right it

945
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,350
turned to the right and that was simply

946
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,790
due to the fact that the earth is

947
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:23,730
spinning so I was trying to hold a

948
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:25,920
straight line as I was turning that so

949
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,680
that's one demonstration of the Coriolis

950
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,520
effect I've got a couple videos here

951
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,710
that I will also show you the Coriolis

952
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,620
force is an apparent force that causes

953
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:40,590
moving objects to appear to bend away

954
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,600
from their intended paths this force can

955
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:45,570
be due to a rotating earth or in this

956
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:48,000
example a rotating platform on a non

957
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,430
rotating platform we can see that a

958
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,640
thrown ball moves in a straight path to

959
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:56,370
the receiver suppose the platform begins

960
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,350
to rotate counterclockwise just as the

961
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,270
earth rotates counterclockwise when

962
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,640
viewed from above the North Pole on the

963
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,440
screen to the left we see that the

964
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,350
thrown ball moves in a straight line

965
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,440
path however when we view the thrown

966
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:13,050
ball on the rotating platform the screen

967
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,570
on the right the camera reveals that

968
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,420
because the platform is rotating the

969
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:21,270
ball in flight appears to curve to its

970
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:23,940
right and the receiver has to lean to

971
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:26,460
the side in order to attempt to catch it

972
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,560
even though the ball actually moves in a

973
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,140
straight line people sitting on the

974
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,940
rotating platform see the ball appeared

975
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,460
to bend to the right of its intended

976
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,530
path the apparent bending of the thrown

977
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,080
ball is due to the fact that the

978
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,510
platform is rotating the apparent force

979
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,610
that causes the bending is the Coriolis

980
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,740
force

981
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:48,540
so this animation explains Coriolis

982
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,340
effect in a little bit different way and

983
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,900
I think it's great except the graphics

984
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,630
aren't necessarily the highest

985
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,950
resolution but we start out we've got

986
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,040
two points that are on the same

987
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:00,540
longitude at different latitudes and so

988
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,000
the point is that as the Earth rotates

989
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:06,780
these two points are going to rotate

990
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,910
together right but if you look at the

991
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,130
paths of each of these two parcels

992
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:13,830
they're going to be different that the

993
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:16,410
parcel that was closer to the equator

994
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:18,390
with a lower latitude had to travel

995
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:23,950
farther in the same amount of time so it

996
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:26,290
had to be moving faster so now imagine

997
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,880
that you've got a rocket at the equator

998
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:31,360
and you're gonna shoot it straight at

999
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,980
this red dot okay but because the rocket

1000
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,930
is at a lower latitude it has a higher

1001
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:40,510
easterly velocity so it's moving to the

1002
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,910
east faster than this red dot is for the

1003
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:47,770
reasons we just saw so if you shoot the

1004
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:50,680
rocket in a straight line it appears

1005
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:52,330
that it turned to the right but from the

1006
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,910
Rockets perspective it was going in a

1007
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:58,150
straight line the whole time it just had

1008
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:00,220
more easterly momentum than the red dot

1009
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,160
does and it appears to curve off to the

1010
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,990
right then you can think of the opposite

1011
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,820
case now imagine the rocket is at the

1012
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,490
North Pole ending in the chute it's

1013
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:12,100
straight at this red dot okay but now

1014
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:14,680
the red dot at a lower latitude has a

1015
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:19,300
higher velocity to the east and the

1016
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:22,240
rocket doesn't have any so again it

1017
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,490
misses and from the perspective of the

1018
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,080
rocket it's going in a straight line but

1019
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,820
the perspective of someone on the ground

1020
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,330
looking at this it looks like it went

1021
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:33,400
too far to the right so no matter which

1022
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:37,120
way you go in the northern hemisphere if

1023
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,010
you move it in a straight line you're

1024
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,750
actually being deflected to the right

1025
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,550
from the perspective of the person on

1026
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,280
the ground that's what the Coriolis

1027
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:47,590
effect is and the Coriolis effect only

1028
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,020
works on something that's a very very

1029
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:53,200
long distance so there's a lot of

1030
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:56,440
folklore and urban legend about Coriolis

1031
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,350
effect so common one is that toilets

1032
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,940
flush clockwise in the Northern

1033
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:03,360
Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the

1034
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:07,540
southern hemisphere maybes opposite

1035
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:11,140
corylus effect only effects things are

1036
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:12,580
very very very long distance so you can

1037
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,470
make a toilet flush either way and

1038
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,140
either hemisphere it doesn't doesn't

1039
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:19,540
change it if that was true if the

1040
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,090
Coriolis effect was so strong that it

1041
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:24,730
would rotate water that only moved a few

1042
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:27,550
inches it would basically be impossible

1043
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:29,740
for us to like drive cars we've just go

1044
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,690
flying off the road to the right or even

1045
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,280
if you just started to run you just

1046
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,840
everybody flying off to the right all

1047
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,600
the time so it doesn't happen that way

1048
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:42,340
it just works on things that are out

1049
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:45,760
very long distances so let's return now

1050
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:48,220
to our those three handouts that we were

1051
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:52,030
looking at earlier so these again these

1052
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:54,220
sea level pressure maps in so now what

1053
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:58,300
we can do is we can make predictions

1054
00:46:54,220 --> 00:47:00,340
about the direction of the wind so we

1055
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,130
the first one we looked at this is map

1056
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:07,240
number one high pressure this big blob

1057
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:12,370
here I know now that winds travel

1058
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:14,530
clockwise around a high so I know that

1059
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:19,030
around this high I don't have winds that

1060
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:20,800
are moving in a clockwise fashion now in

1061
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,140
this class what we're going to do is

1062
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,900
we're going to assume that the winds are

1063
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,360
traveling parallel to the contour lines

1064
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:34,180
so in other words I know the winds going

1065
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:39,030
to be doing this so I'm drawing lines

1066
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:43,840
that are parallel between these contours

1067
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:48,700
but their overall going in a clockwise

1068
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:50,590
fashion right so if I asked you okay

1069
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,300
what is the wind well let's say in

1070
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,750
Albuquerque what's the wind albuquerque

1071
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:58,870
doing well right here if you drew an

1072
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:01,120
arrow the wind is coming from the

1073
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:04,660
southeast and it's traveling to the

1074
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,930
northwest so here's a convention with

1075
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:10,570
wind wind is always described in the

1076
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,970
direction is coming from so if I have a

1077
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:15,640
north wind that means it's coming from

1078
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,410
the north right if I have a westerly

1079
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,730
wind is coming from the West

1080
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:24,370
okay so we can predict which way the

1081
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,170
winds going to be blowing by simply

1082
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,510
thinking about okay do I have clockwise

1083
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:32,050
or counterclockwise and then drawing a

1084
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:34,570
little short segments that are going

1085
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:37,960
clockwise in this case around this high

1086
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:41,040
but staying parallel to these contour

1087
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:44,820
lines so let's do another example

1088
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,820
let's do page two

1089
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:53,120
so we've got wind that's going clockwise

1090
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:55,460
around the high and let's look at the

1091
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,010
low instead we've got so we know wind

1092
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,440
goes counterclockwise are on the low and

1093
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:03,970
again we're gonna say it goes parallel

1094
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:07,010
to the contour lines so when we be going

1095
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:10,520
kind of like this I'm drawing little

1096
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:12,950
segments right little segments of arrows

1097
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,390
that are going over all counterclockwise

1098
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:20,330
but staying between

1099
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:23,240
the contour lines now realistically what

1100
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:26,840
happens is that air that's aloft up

1101
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,030
above our heads is moving exactly

1102
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,670
parallel to the contour lines just like

1103
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:35,180
I described what happens here on the

1104
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:37,280
ground is a little different wind hits

1105
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:40,010
trees and buildings and mountains and

1106
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,490
the slows down and what happens actually

1107
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:47,830
is it spirals inward kind of like this

1108
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:47,830
when it gets close to the surface

1109
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:56,510
showing up or not spiraling inwards and

1110
00:49:52,610 --> 00:50:02,780
a near the surface high pressure spirals

1111
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:05,030
outwards near the surface like that but

1112
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:07,610
for this class for the exercises we're

1113
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,950
going to do we're just going to draw the

1114
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,750
wind arrows parallel to the contour

1115
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,540
lines every time okay that way we'll

1116
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:15,740
just be consistent on the wind direction

1117
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:18,740
alright so here's an example what I

1118
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:21,140
could do I can say all right what is the

1119
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:25,910
wind direction in Tennessee

1120
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:27,830
okay so there's Tennessee and we know we

1121
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,930
have counterclockwise so it's coming

1122
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,580
around this way so what would the wind

1123
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:34,250
be like right there

1124
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:38,210
okay so right there I'm going to draw a

1125
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:41,360
straight segment that is parallel to

1126
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:46,040
those contour lines and it's coming from

1127
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:49,130
the North West right that is a northwest

1128
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:51,110
wind okay so if you're one of my

1129
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,760
students you will have an exercise where

1130
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,330
you're going to be asked to identify the

1131
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,770
wind direction on a map like this so the

1132
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,619
correct answer is you want to give or

1133
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,039
something like

1134
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:05,460
north or northwest sometimes I get

1135
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:07,109
answers hot wise or counter clockwise so

1136
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,390
we never go outside and say oh man is

1137
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:11,759
blowing counterclockwise out here from

1138
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:14,009
our perspective on the ground the wind's

1139
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:15,450
coming from one direction only and what

1140
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:18,420
I'm asking you is to figure out what

1141
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:21,450
that one direction is so you're drawing

1142
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:25,680
your wind direction as straight segments

1143
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:29,369
okay so let's do another one what is the

1144
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:34,109
wind like in Minnesota all right so

1145
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:36,029
here's Minnesota and so here I'm between

1146
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:37,109
a high and I'm between a low so how do I

1147
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:39,390
know which one to pick

1148
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:41,099
so we'll do an example with each so

1149
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:44,309
let's say I do the one with the high I

1150
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:46,980
know I got clockwise around high so I

1151
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:49,319
know I've got wind coming around here

1152
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:53,460
this is going this way so I want to draw

1153
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:57,450
a straight segment in Minnesota so right

1154
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,190
there would be the wind direction right

1155
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:02,579
so that's consistent with clockwise

1156
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:06,299
around a high it's coming from the north

1157
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:11,390
to Northeast right okay so let's say

1158
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:14,369
instead I picked the low low

1159
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:18,960
counterclockwise around the low so I've

1160
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:24,180
got wind coming around this way and when

1161
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,710
I get down here the Minnesota I'm gonna

1162
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,869
have draw a straight segment that's

1163
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,549
approximately almost going the exact

1164
00:52:27,869 --> 00:52:31,799
same direction as the first one we did

1165
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:34,589
also from the north or a little bit

1166
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:35,849
north east so it doesn't matter which

1167
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:43,589
one you pick you should get the same

1168
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:47,279
answer let's move on to number three so

1169
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:49,499
how would we deal with this trough so in

1170
00:52:47,279 --> 00:52:51,150
a low let's look at this little out in

1171
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,609
the ocean first you got counterclockwise

1172
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:57,329
around the low so I can draw a little

1173
00:52:53,609 --> 00:53:01,710
straight segments around the low like

1174
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:05,339
this right and it's no different around

1175
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:09,059
the low up here the low up here you get

1176
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:12,060
straight segments coming down and going

1177
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:14,160
around that low and counterclockwise

1178
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,980
and you just extend that all the way

1179
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:24,570
down so down here in this trough I would

1180
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:26,070
have wind doing this right so I could do

1181
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,020
the same thing I could ask you what's

1182
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:33,420
the wind direction at any location here

1183
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:41,340
within the trough now let me go I'm

1184
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:46,230
gonna pull up number two again I want to

1185
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:48,810
point out something that we alluded to a

1186
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:51,090
little bit but didn't talk about notice

1187
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:53,940
the spacing between these contours is

1188
00:53:51,090 --> 00:54:00,180
very tight and the spacing between these

1189
00:53:53,940 --> 00:54:02,340
contours is very open right so if I were

1190
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,740
to walk let's say I were to walk

1191
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,690
straight across this direction here far

1192
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:09,630
to walk straight across this direction I

1193
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:13,440
would notice that the the pressure as I

1194
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:16,230
move this way is decreasing but not by

1195
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,470
much whereas if I walk this direction I

1196
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:22,770
would notice that the air pressure is

1197
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:26,400
decreasing but it's decreasing at a much

1198
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:28,640
more rapid rate okay so we have a name

1199
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,500
for this is called pressure gradient

1200
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,340
here as I walk along these tightly

1201
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:38,910
spaced contours the pressure is changing

1202
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:40,710
rapidly as I walk right here not so much

1203
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:42,720
we would say this has a high pressure

1204
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,850
gradient this has a low pressure

1205
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,530
gradient what would the pressure

1206
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,630
gradient be like if I walked out through

1207
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:51,120
here well we're not crossing any

1208
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:54,960
contours at all so the pressure gradient

1209
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:57,480
itself is essentially zero so there's

1210
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,720
very little to no pressure change in

1211
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,640
here so very low pressure gradient or if

1212
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,370
I walk through here or swim I guess it

1213
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,890
would be across the ocean this way the

1214
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:09,570
pressure is just barely changing right

1215
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:11,580
through here so it's a very low pressure

1216
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:16,290
gradient this is a higher pressure

1217
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:18,980
gradient okay so turns out the wind

1218
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:23,040
speed depends on the pressure gradient

1219
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:26,340
so winds blow faster where the pressure

1220
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:30,420
gradient is stronger so if I had

1221
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:32,370
to shade in say where is the where is

1222
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,920
the highest wind speed in this diagram

1223
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:37,380
the highest wind speed are going to be

1224
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,500
the locations where the the pressure

1225
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:42,770
contours are closest together so be a

1226
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,720
very very high wind speed for example

1227
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:48,750
all around the SLO here where these

1228
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:53,220
pressure contours are very tight what

1229
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:55,710
about out in here out in here the winds

1230
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:59,190
are probably non-existent out here or

1231
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:01,740
the winds are very very slow out in here

1232
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:04,800
so you can use the spacing of the

1233
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:08,010
contours to predict how fast the wind is

1234
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,650
going to blow okay so to conclude what

1235
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:13,680
we've learned here just using air

1236
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:17,070
pressure from a barometer we can create

1237
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,260
a sea-level pressure map from that map

1238
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:22,020
we can identify places where the air is

1239
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,280
rising and sinking from that we can

1240
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:26,520
figure out where it's going to be cloudy

1241
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,320
and clear then we can use the contours

1242
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,960
to figure out the direction of the wind

1243
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,720
and we can use the spacing of the

1244
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,620
contours to get a relative sense of wind

1245
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:41,190
speed so all of this is just due to one

1246
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:44,210
thing which is air pressure all right

1247
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,210
thanks for listening

1248
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:52,650
you
