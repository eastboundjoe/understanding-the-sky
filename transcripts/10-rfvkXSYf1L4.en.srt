1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,750
everybody this is just a little extra

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:10,559
help on figuring out wind direction and

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,540
so if you're just given a let's say in

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,630
this case all I have is a high-pressure

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:21,779
Center and let's say I've got a city

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:23,250
here and I've got a city here now how do

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,340
I figure out the wind direction so I

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,260
have to know if it's northern hemisphere

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,689
or southern hemisphere so let's just say

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,660
this is northern hemisphere so I know

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,989
I've got clockwise rotation around a

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,809
high in the northern hemisphere so what

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,739
what you imagine is this circle that's

14
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,739
centered on the H that's coming around

15
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:49,460
passing right through say a and then

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:54,410
another circle that's coming around

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:57,989
that's passing right through B okay now

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:00,629
when we're figuring out wind ultimately

19
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,059
what we have to do is draw a straight

20
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,189
line segment because what we want the

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,490
goal is that is to say the wind is

22
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:11,310
blowing from the north west or south we

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,990
need a single direction so it's not good

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,880
enough to say that the the wind is

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,000
curved we want to know what is the

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,520
direction exactly at that point so this

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,280
is if you remember tangents from math

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,060
write a tangent of a circle this is what

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,720
we're drawing so here the tangent to

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,900
that circle at that point would be that

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,880
so it's clockwise winds I know the winds

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,180
come in this direction and it comes

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,509
around and passes through a you'll

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,280
become exactly from the north and wind

35
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,409
is always described in the direction is

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,500
coming from so this would be a north

37
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,420
wind so if I asked you what you know

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,640
describe the direction you would say

39
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,670
north

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,610
what would the direction be city B well

41
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,500
exactly the same thing because you still

42
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,009
have this cone around this is a tangent

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,129
to the circle at that point also north

44
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:13,040
and in fact any city I have here along

45
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:15,379
this line these would all be north winds

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,000
difference might be the speed but we're

47
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,560
not trying to figure out the speed all

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,650
we can do is figure out the direction

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,480
here so let's pick another one let's say

50
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,310
I said okay what's the wind direction

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:32,150
here okay and again northern hemisphere

52
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,099
so I figure okay this is I you know

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,030
again think of a circle centered in the

54
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:43,159
center of the H and I've got a clockwise

55
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:46,389
rotation around the H what's the tangent

56
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,980
at that point might look like this

57
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:51,799
where's that wind coming from it's

58
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,189
coming from the south west right it's

59
00:02:51,799 --> 00:03:01,370
coming from this area down there so this

60
00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:03,319
would be a south west wind so again when

61
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:08,900
we describe when it's the direction it's

62
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:17,479
coming from okay so let's do say another

63
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:25,489
example and let's say I've got a low and

64
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:29,680
I've got a high okay all right so let's

65
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,919
say I've got a city let's say right here

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,889
okay

67
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,199
so what do I do and again if this is

68
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:38,449
northern hemisphere counterclockwise

69
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,519
think of it think of a circle going

70
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:43,790
around the low and it's going to be

71
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,790
going counterclockwise so you'll be

72
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,489
coming to kind of right through here and

73
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:54,169
what's the tangent of that circle at

74
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:55,159
that point like this in which direction

75
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,079
is it coming from

76
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,319
it's coming from that it's coming from

77
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:06,590
this direction which is south east so

78
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:10,280
this is a south east wind now if you've

79
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,889
got multiple pressure centers like a

80
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,280
high and a low and I've got something in

81
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:18,049
the middle and I want to know well which

82
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:23,180
direction is it do I use the high or the

83
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:25,730
low if I use the low I imagine a circle

84
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,070
that's centered on the low

85
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,070
coming this way so I'm gonna draw that

86
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:38,240
okay and if I imagine the hi let me just

87
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:42,310
have a Harrow to that if I imagine it

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,240
coming around the hi I would have an arc

89
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,630
go in this direction

90
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,820
okay so clockwise are on the high

91
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:53,450
counterclockwise are on the low the

92
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:56,600
tangent to either one of those is the

93
00:04:53,450 --> 00:05:03,680
same answer so in this case it's from

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:05,090
the south west so if you've got a high

95
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,510
and a low and you have a point in the

96
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,450
middle it doesn't matter how you think

97
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:23,450
of it you'll get the same answer now

98
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:28,820
what if I had a high and a high okay and

99
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:32,510
I got a point right here so if you've

100
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,090
got two of the same pressure go with the

101
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,130
one you're closest to I'm closest to

102
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,160
this one so I'm going to use the

103
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:46,430
clockwise move rotation around the high

104
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,620
draw my tangent okay and then I'd have

105
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:53,270
an answer that's from the north west

106
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,650
that's a northwest wind I will not give

107
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,600
you one that's exactly in the middle

108
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,010
because that one's actually you know

109
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,570
you'd have to have more information to

110
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,150
solve it because one of them would be

111
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,470
going clockwise and going from one way

112
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,090
and the other one would be coming around

113
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,280
clockwise the other way and they cancel

114
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,870
each other out so realistically what

115
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,490
happens is there's basically no wind in

116
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,740
the middle we didn't get into that

117
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,020
doesn't matter okay so if you've got

118
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,400
more than one pressure center go towards

119
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,050
the one that's closest that's usually

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,670
just the rule to remember okay so so

121
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,160
that's how you do it if you don't have

122
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,430
any contour lines if you do have contour

123
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,430
lines

124
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,890
the contour lines is the same thing

125
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,170
except you'd know more information

126
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:40,940
because the contour lines help you help

127
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:43,250
guide you so on this one let's see so

128
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,470
I've got a low right here in fact it's

129
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:51,800
kind of split into two here so I'll just

130
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:55,160
kind of put try this it's got it hello

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,480
it's really kind of it's one single low

132
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,630
but it's kind of broke it up into two

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,030
blobs but all you need to know is that

134
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,870
because this is a low and I'm in the

135
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,420
northern hemisphere

136
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,390
I've got counterclockwise circulation

137
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,040
and what we said in this class is that

138
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,820
we're gonna assume the wind was parallel

139
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,820
to the contour lines so I draw a little

140
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:20,510
wiggle straight segments again these are

141
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:24,380
like tangents to the contour lines going

142
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,330
around and then if I asked you say you

143
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,240
know what is the you know what is the

144
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,080
wind direction right here you would say

145
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:37,790
well it's from the North West right

146
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:42,520
that's a northwest wind and if you were

147
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:44,810
over here on the high so here I've got

148
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,790
these numbers are getting larger towards

149
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:52,130
the center so this is an H right there

150
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,680
and so I've got clockwise rotation

151
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,430
around a high in the northern hemisphere

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,740
so I know I've got wind coming this way

153
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:06,560
and I just draw on little straight

154
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:09,410
segments okay or if I was between

155
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:16,520
contours same thing just stay parallel

156
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:18,110
to the contours right so again if I

157
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,180
asked you you know what's the what's the

158
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,430
wind right here this one would be from

159
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,410
the south west

160
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,460
that's a southwest wind so the

161
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,830
difference the only difference between

162
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,870
these and the one that we just did is

163
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,700
that here you don't have any additional

164
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,610
information so you're assuming the winds

165
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,250
are going circular around them when we

166
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,320
have sea level pressure maps that

167
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,650
contours give us some more information

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,200
we can see that it's not perfectly a

169
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,420
perfectly circular circulation but it's

170
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,550
kind of this weird egg-shaped thing okay

171
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,600
so I hope that helped if we if you get

172
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,880
one that's in the southern hemisphere

173
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,250
just remember the rules are reversed

174
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,950
so around the hi in the southern

175
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,670
hemisphere counterclockwise around the

176
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,820
low in the southern hemisphere clockwise

177
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,820
all right
