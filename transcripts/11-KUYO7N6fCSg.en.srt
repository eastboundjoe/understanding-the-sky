1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,830
hey how you doing this is Mel strong and

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,530
this lecture is on temperature

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,120
inversions and air pollution and we're

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,820
going to start by looking at the

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,650
structure of Earth's atmosphere now we

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,750
know something about this because every

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,850
day we launch weather balloons up into

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,740
the atmosphere to collect data and

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,269
here's an example of one of these

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,250
weather balloons at this guy's holding

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,430
he's got this whole box here and that

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,050
box is called the radiosonde and it's

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,850
like a little weather station and that a

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,739
records temperature and humidity and

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,770
wind and all this kinds of stuff and it

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,629
beams it back to earth wirelessly so all

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,280
he does is let go of this balloon and it

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,950
goes up through the atmosphere and as it

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,079
goes up it expands because we said

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,930
rising parcels of air always have to

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,090
expand and cool well eventually this

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,039
will expand so much that it will pop and

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,500
this will fall back to earth with a

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,930
little parachute now there's a whole

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,000
network of airports around the world

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,280
that are designated spots to launch

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,470
weather balloons and we do it every 12

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,689
hours and the reason for this is in

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,700
weather forecasting you need to know

30
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,220
what the conditions are up in the upper

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,530
part of the atmosphere so it turns out

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,509
that Albuquerque's Airport the Sunport

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,700
is one of these airports that launches

34
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,049
weather balloons so about five or six in

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,259
the morning and five or six in the

36
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,090
evening we'll launch one of these and as

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,909
it goes up to the atmosphere it collects

38
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,220
data and here's an example of some data

39
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,159
that was collected as an afternoon on

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,520
the July 4th and so this one probably

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,380
went up at 5:00 in the afternoon and

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,380
here on the x-axis that's air

43
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,360
temperature in the y-axis is height so

44
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,759
the red represents the temperature that

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,189
the weather balloon a sensed as it was

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,740
ascending up into the atmosphere so here

47
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,799
at the surface you can see before the

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,570
weather balloon was let go it was 90

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,610
degrees at the surface and as soon as it

50
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,890
was launched the weather balloon noticed

51
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,200
that it whether the air is getting

52
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,899
colder with height and then it gets to

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,660
about 50,000 feet and suddenly you

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,720
notice that it starts getting warmer

55
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,710
with height this inflection point right

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,110
here we talked about

57
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,260
before when we talked about clouds and

58
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,580
how we said that this makes a natural

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,680
break between two layers in the

60
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,770
atmosphere this is called the tropopause

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,590
and it's a surface between all the air

62
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,210
below which is the troposphere and they

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,540
all the air above which is the

64
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:36,330
stratosphere now we didn't talk to the

65
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,280
time why it gets warmer with height now

66
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,810
in this case what happened is the

67
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,300
weather one popped at about a hundred

68
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,770
thousand feet but if it could have kept

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,770
going it would have noticed that it

70
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,990
continued to get warmer with height so

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,660
if you could look up in this in the

72
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,540
stratosphere what you would see is there

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,490
a small number of these molecules of

74
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,890
what we call ozone which are three

75
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:03,330
oxygen molecules bonded together oh

76
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,070
three an ozone hangs out there's not

77
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,290
much of it up there but it hangs out in

78
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,570
the in the stratosphere and if

79
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,270
ultraviolet light comes in from the Sun

80
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,910
and UV light is what gives you a sunburn

81
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,880
right so we have UV light here at the

82
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,100
surface but we don't have nearly as much

83
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,350
at the surface as we would at the top of

84
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,080
the atmosphere because when the UV light

85
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,720
comes down through this ozone you know

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,480
strike an ozone molecule and it'll break

87
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,210
the ozone into two pieces and o2 and an

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,670
O now eventually through a number of

89
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,550
steps these two pieces will come back

90
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,430
together and make a new ozone but when

91
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:44,040
it breaks it apart two things happen for

92
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,930
one the UV is blocked it doesn't reach

93
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,500
the surface of the earth that's a good

94
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,260
news for us

95
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,890
and number two it releases a little bit

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,420
of heat so all of these ozone molecules

97
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,940
floating around up in the stratosphere

98
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,790
are getting whacked with UV radiation

99
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,190
all the time and as a result it's adding

100
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,530
warmth to the stratosphere which is why

101
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,910
the stratosphere actually gets warmer

102
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,800
with height now the amount of UV that

103
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,720
comes in from the upper atmosphere is so

104
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,060
great that we wouldn't actually be able

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,070
to exist on the surface if it wasn't for

106
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,530
the ozone layer there's so much

107
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,049
radiation coming from the Sun you're

108
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,880
essentially sterilized the planet so the

109
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,860
amount of UV that gives us sunburns is

110
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,030
just a tiny tiny percent of the amount

111
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,620
of UV

112
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,860
would normally hit the surface if it

113
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,380
wasn't for this ozone layer

114
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,750
so this ozone layer is super beneficial

115
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,330
to not just humans but to all life on

116
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,639
Earth at least everything on the land

117
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:45,090
but it's actually been declining over

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,400
the past several decades so here we have

119
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,580
a couple images of the ozone in the

120
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,860
southern hemisphere and we're looking at

121
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,840
colors that represent how much ozone is

122
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,110
in the stratosphere so the blue

123
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,810
represents very little ozone or as the

124
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,700
greens and yellows that's more ozone

125
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,160
that's the South Pole and you can kind

126
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,430
of make out Antarctica down there so

127
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,150
we've got to mid two images one in 1979

128
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:15,870
one in 2012 and you can see how it's

129
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,840
more that blue is in the 2012 image this

130
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,260
is what we what we refer to as the ozone

131
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,380
hole is this area kind of centered in

132
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,419
the southern hemisphere where UV

133
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,460
radiation can go right through that and

134
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,040
strike the surface below because there's

135
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,600
very little ozone here now

136
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,090
there's not a lot of people living in

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,060
Antarctica so it hasn't been a huge

138
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,520
hazard for human health but this was

139
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,160
discovered in the 1980s and there is a

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840
big worry in that this ozone hole was

141
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,070
going to continue to grow because they

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,720
could see it growing and there's a

143
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,300
there's a fear that it would actually

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,430
engulf the whole planet and if it did if

145
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,050
we lost the ozone layer you know we

146
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,250
couldn't survive on land so it was a

147
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,650
pretty big deal so scientists started

148
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,450
looking at this in the 1970s and they

149
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,340
realized that there is this family of

150
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,910
molecules that we were manufacturing

151
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,039
called chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs and

152
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,470
they get their name because they have

153
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,240
one at least one atom of chlorine one

154
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,940
atom of fluorine and one atom of carbon

155
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,470
in their molecular structure so here's a

156
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:24,120
simple one called freon 11 and freon 11

157
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,270
is a type of refrigerant it's supposed

158
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,000
to be inside the guts of a refrigerator

159
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,770
or air-conditioner and as long as it's

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,870
in there it's safe but if it ever gets

161
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,310
out and it gets into the atmosphere and

162
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,640
if it makes it way up to the

163
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,260
stratosphere a CFC molecule will attach

164
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,630
itself to an ozone

165
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,850
it'll break it apart and then those two

166
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,380
parts can't actually get back together

167
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,400
like they could if they were broken

168
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:54,350
apart by UV a single CFC molecule can

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,020
destroy thousands of ozone molecules and

170
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,150
back in the day they used CFCs for all

171
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,360
kinds of things so they were a popular

172
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,790
propellant in aerosol cans so if you had

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,400
if you bought any kind of anything in a

174
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,430
spray can back in the 70s it had CFCs as

175
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,520
a propellant we use it as refrigerants

176
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,160
and air conditioners it made very nice

177
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,440
cleaning solvents so it was a very

178
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:24,240
useful family of chemicals that were

179
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,040
being made well by the mid-1980s it was

180
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,930
recognized that the ozone layer was

181
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,500
thinning and there was a formation of

182
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,600
this ozone hole over Antarctica so

183
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,460
people started to panic because they

184
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,190
realized this is a super bad thing to

185
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,830
happen and in 1987 a bunch of countries

186
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,390
got together and foreign what was called

187
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,820
the Montreal Protocol and it's like a

188
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,510
treaty among nations and the agreement

189
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,240
was everybody we need to stop

190
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:53,820
manufacturing CFCs and the rich

191
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,090
countries agreed to go first and this

192
00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:00,660
continued CFCs and then poorer countries

193
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:03,510
would discontinue it later on well as

194
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,720
they watch the ozone hole grow and grow

195
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,670
in the 80s and the 90s they got back

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,040
together in the 90s a couple more times

197
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:14,310
and signed a couple new treaties to kind

198
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,110
of speed this whole process up by 2006

199
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,380
the ozone hole is the largest had ever

200
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:22,710
been and by 2015

201
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,020
finally all of the countries were in on

202
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,690
the you know ending the production of

203
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,480
CFCs so it took 30 years from the time

204
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:33,419
that they discovered this - when finally

205
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,070
everybody stop making CFCs now just

206
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,919
because they stopped making them doesn't

207
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,020
mean the problems over because a lot of

208
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,419
the CFCs in the atmosphere they'll last

209
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,310
hundreds or thousands of years and a lot

210
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:49,170
of them haven't even gotten up to the

211
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,720
stratosphere yet but after years of

212
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,550
decline and this is this is a how much

213
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,709
ozone is in that

214
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,420
lair the atmosphere so in the 50s and

215
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,670
60s this is kind of how much ozone

216
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,370
should be up there and we see the

217
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,600
decline start in the 70s and the 80s and

218
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,550
right and here is kind of where people

219
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,490
were panicking and starting those

220
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,370
treaties we see it looks like it kind of

221
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,950
bottomed out here in the mid 90s to 2000

222
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,079
technically right there that's the where

223
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,690
it was the the biggest that was owned

224
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:21,510
homes the biggest in 2006 but what we

225
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,760
see is that very slowly in the last few

226
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,310
years the ozone is starting to come back

227
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,290
now it's going to take decades maybe 100

228
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,540
years or more for the ozone layer to

229
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,940
come back to the layer to the you know

230
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,730
amounts that it was previously but

231
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,140
because there were these this protocol

232
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,760
because there were these treaties

233
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,310
because the countries came together and

234
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,070
greed this is a worldwide environmental

235
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,839
problem and they agreed to sign the

236
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,990
treaty and they agreed to stick with it

237
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,450
the ozone hole is actually a problem

238
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,550
that we have humans have solved I mean

239
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,920
it hasn't been has been fixed yet but

240
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,320
it's on its way to recovery and this is

241
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,760
a model that we're going to talk about

242
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,490
when we talked about air pollution and

243
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,920
later greenhouse gases is can we get all

244
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,350
the countries together to agree to clean

245
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,660
up the air in to clean up problems that

246
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,339
affect everybody on the planet and not

247
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,870
just the country that's making the

248
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:17,880
chemicals so we're going to return to

249
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,510
examining these two layers and so far

250
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,220
what we've said is that the troposphere

251
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,990
is characterized by the fact that it

252
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,209
gets cooler with height or as the

253
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,220
stratosphere gets warmer with height we

254
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:32,790
also said that the stratosphere has

255
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,190
ozone and the troposphere does not now

256
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,050
there's also several other very

257
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,079
important differences notice what

258
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,029
happens with dew point so dew point at

259
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,370
the surface was about 40 degrees and

260
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,199
then you see it goes down down down down

261
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,149
and by the time you get to the

262
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:52,350
stratosphere the dew points like minus

263
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:54,180
100 so that's super super dry air most

264
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,390
of the moisture in the atmosphere is

265
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,550
down near the surface okay and in fact

266
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,130
if we look at what's happening in the

267
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,690
troposphere itself it has almost

268
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,540
anything you'd be interested in

269
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,139
regarding whether all the clouds are in

270
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,929
the tropics

271
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:12,209
here 99% of all the water vapors in the

272
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:13,709
troposphere everything you think of as

273
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:17,549
weather is happening in the troposphere

274
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:19,739
and in fact 75% of all the air molecules

275
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:23,249
in the entire atmosphere are in the

276
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:25,949
troposphere now what's the stratosphere

277
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:29,189
like well some people that have more

278
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:31,290
expendable than income than I do get

279
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,339
cellphones and by weather balloons

280
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,929
because anybody can buy a weather

281
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,609
balloon and they tie their cell phone to

282
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:37,410
the weather balloon and they launch it I

283
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:39,059
think I guess they have some app that

284
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,339
just automatically takes pictures and

285
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:44,009
then they use like their find your phone

286
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,649
feature to find the phone when it lands

287
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:48,419
somewhere and so here's a picture taken

288
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,730
in a hundred thousand feet this is how

289
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,040
this is right here where our weather

290
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,669
balloon popped this is what it looks

291
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,720
like notice that the sky is black you

292
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:59,939
can see the curvature of the earth

293
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,309
if you didn't know any better you just

294
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:04,379
think you're in space but this is how

295
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:05,939
little air is actually in the

296
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:09,169
stratosphere by the time you get up

297
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:12,149
there this guy is black from lack of air

298
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:13,949
remember this guy a few years ago he

299
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,139
jumped out of a balloon to set a world

300
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:19,379
record and he decided to jump out over

301
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:22,079
New Mexico and when he jumped out he was

302
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:23,639
at 128 thousand feet which is kind of

303
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,949
roughly right in the middle of the

304
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,439
stratosphere and again in these pictures

305
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,970
it looks like he's in space right black

306
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:33,439
sky you see the curvature of the earth

307
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,329
looks like he's wearing a spacesuit so

308
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:38,999
even though when you looking at in a

309
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:41,369
textbook they will show that the

310
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:43,919
atmosphere has many layers here's the

311
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:45,179
troposphere here's the stratosphere and

312
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,069
then above that something called the

313
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,589
mesosphere and above that something kind

314
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:51,539
of thermosphere it looks like the

315
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,279
atmosphere is pretty thick but by the

316
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,709
time you get up to here where those

317
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,629
pictures were taken it's already so

318
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:00,749
little air that the sky is black and

319
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:03,779
like we said 75% of the air is in this

320
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:06,299
troposphere region so the atmosphere is

321
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,970
not as thick as his diagrams like this

322
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:13,230
imply most of these layers have very

323
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,879
very little hair in them so this brings

324
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,759
up another point that we haven't really

325
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,560
talked about yet but in a cumulonimbus

326
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:23,800
we've said that you can have an anvil

327
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,050
and the anvil itself is made of ice but

328
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,090
we haven't really talked about why it is

329
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,460
that the anvil grows in the first place

330
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,460
like why does it why is it flat on top

331
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,200
why doesn't it just keep going up so

332
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,110
here's another anvil from space

333
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,970
so convection is happening here and then

334
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,400
something's causing it to flatten out we

335
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:46,089
said that this is all ice but why is it

336
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,270
so flat well the reason it's flat is

337
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:53,470
because the cumulonimbus column is

338
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:56,470
coming up against the tropopause so warm

339
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,089
air can convict easily in the

340
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,370
troposphere most of the time because

341
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,050
it's getting colder with height so warm

342
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,230
air can rise through air that's getting

343
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,880
colder but up in the stratosphere we

344
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,270
have something called a temperature

345
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,330
inversion what that means is it's

346
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,040
getting warmer with height it's inverted

347
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,720
to what you expect you expect the

348
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,670
atmosphere normally it gets colder with

349
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,820
height the temperature inversion means

350
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,670
it's getting warmer with height well you

351
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,250
can't make warm air rise through air

352
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,170
that's getting warmer so anything that's

353
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,350
convecting anything that's rising from

354
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,720
the surface gets stuck right here at the

355
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,420
tropopause and for our key mule in the

356
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,890
mist that means that's the top so warm

357
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,350
if the conditions are right and we have

358
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,240
unstable air air will convict and it

359
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,490
will rise but when it gets to the

360
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,740
tropopause it will get stuck and it will

361
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,410
spread out right at the tropopause

362
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,500
right underneath the stratosphere so the

363
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,540
stratosphere really acts like a cap it

364
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,800
prevents convection from going any

365
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,150
further up now sometimes if the

366
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,070
conditions are right you can get

367
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,070
temperature inversions and other places

368
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,260
than the stratosphere so right here

369
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,060
there's a tiny little temperature

370
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,860
inversion here's a little temperature

371
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,410
inversion here's a little temperature

372
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,080
inversion and if I'm sending up a little

373
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:21,760
plume of warm air it's gonna get stuck

374
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,980
right there okay so this is critical

375
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,339
for air pollution so in other words

376
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,850
let's imagine that we have I really make

377
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:32,230
another graph like these and our graph

378
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,370
looks like this so the weather balloon

379
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:38,320
goes up

380
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:40,120
and it recognizes this kind of pattern

381
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,980
so it recognizes the fact that it got

382
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,810
colder with height and then he got

383
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,910
warmer a little bit and then it got

384
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,420
colder with height and right here

385
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:52,180
that's our stratosphere up here right

386
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:56,440
but this right here this thing right

387
00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:01,350
here is a temperature inversion so let's

388
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:05,680
imagine that we have a city down here

389
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:08,350
and there's smoke coming out everybody m

390
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,530
nee when the smoke will rise cuz it's

391
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,470
warm but once it hits that inversion

392
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:16,540
it's going to get stuck and if I have a

393
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,000
whole city and a whole bunch of houses

394
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,010
and a whole bunch of cars and all the

395
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,350
pollution is trapped below this in

396
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,090
temperature inversion and as long as

397
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,640
this temperature inversion stays there

398
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:32,110
this pollution continues to be trapped

399
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,440
below it so sometimes you can see

400
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,240
something like this where you have

401
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,370
here's rising warm air it's just you

402
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,500
know it's a fire and then it hits a

403
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:46,600
temperature inversion and bam the smoke

404
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:48,400
doesn't go above that line here is a

405
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,440
really severe temperature inversion

406
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,110
where it goes right down to the surface

407
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,150
so any pollution that's coming out of

408
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,120
anything a car a house and anything is

409
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:01,300
stuck right there along the surface of

410
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,510
the ground so what would cause this well

411
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:07,180
one of the things that causes two

412
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:09,820
inversions close to the surface is high

413
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,800
pressure so before what we talked about

414
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,750
is that height so this is a slide from a

415
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,630
previous lecture and we said you have

416
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,760
winds aloft that converge and then they

417
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,650
go down and all these things happen

418
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,830
right well the other thing that we could

419
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,959
add to this list from last time is that

420
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:28,810
we can make temperature inversions if

421
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,480
you make temperature inversions you can

422
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,730
trap pollution down here if you trap

423
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,150
pollution down here you might have very

424
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,340
poor air quality now one day of this no

425
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,110
big deal but you can have high pressure

426
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,810
centers that might be parked over an

427
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,330
area for a week or maybe two weeks or

428
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,960
even more and that starts to make the

429
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,710
air quality

430
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,890
really poor on the other hand if you

431
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,260
have a low pressure it actually cleans

432
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,929
the air out so it's like this giant

433
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,970
vacuum cleaner in the sky and it lifts

434
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:04,000
up all the air pollution and takes it

435
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,370
away so let me show you a couple of

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,559
pictures that show the effect of one of

437
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,570
these temperature inversions so here I

438
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,669
am about 30 miles west of Albuquerque

439
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,610
I'm about 10,000 feet above the ground

440
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:17,950
and I want you to notice what you can

441
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,559
see in other words notice the detail the

442
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,720
terrain that you can see in here or in

443
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,539
this one right now

444
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,010
a high pressure had started building a

445
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,510
couple days before I took these pictures

446
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,899
and you can see some haze in the

447
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,820
distance but then I went back about two

448
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:36,970
weeks later and not high pressure had

449
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,309
just stayed there for two weeks and when

450
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,350
I went back and I fluid the same spot at

451
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:44,500
the same height and I took another

452
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:47,049
picture in the same spot and notice how

453
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,679
it looks now you can barely tell the

454
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,789
surface is down there right so

455
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,220
definitely you can't see the detail you

456
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,289
saw before what we're looking at is air

457
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,380
pollution that's stuck below an

458
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:01,600
inversion and you can see from the from

459
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,299
the city this is downtown you can see

460
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:09,610
that air pollution down here below

461
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:11,620
trapped below the inversion so sometimes

462
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,600
the inversions can be really striking so

463
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,279
here's one thing Kazakhstan and you can

464
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,529
see right at the top of the inversion

465
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,570
and now the super polluted air that's

466
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:21,669
below and they're really clean here

467
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:24,640
that's above so the right there that's

468
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:27,309
the top of the inversion there now when

469
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,710
you have a city in a valley you can get

470
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:31,779
inversions and in other ways than the

471
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,970
ways that I've just described what

472
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,370
happens is a cold air can settle in the

473
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,919
bottom of a valley and because it's

474
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,779
dense it stays down there and it forms

475
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,409
an inversion that can last for weeks and

476
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:47,500
weeks and more locally Salt Lake City

477
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:49,990
has this problem a lot so down there and

478
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,110
that hay is a Salt Lake City it sits in

479
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,149
this bowl and fills with cold air and

480
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,149
they will have weeks of weather just

481
00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:00,140
like this so here's another image Salt

482
00:19:58,149 --> 00:20:01,910
Lake City you can see the brown above it

483
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,860
so there's that inversion the top of the

484
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,600
inversions about right there and you see

485
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,000
that the tops of the mountains look a

486
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,049
lot cleaner up here that's cleaner air

487
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,549
so this happens a lot in the in Salt

488
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:16,730
Lake City like weeks and weeks they'll

489
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:19,490
have this kind of air pollution problems

490
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,309
so if you go back to the last lecture

491
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,440
and look at those pressure maps here's

492
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:25,790
the first one we looked at and we said

493
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,030
that this is a big ridge of high

494
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:33,850
pressure not only do we now know that

495
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:37,730
this is sinking air and that we have

496
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:41,809
cloudless skies but if this sits over

497
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,210
the western US for days or a couple

498
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,790
weeks we also now know that it's going

499
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,620
to contribute to poor air quality that

500
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,000
is to say that the sinking air is

501
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,760
probably creating a temperature

502
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,760
inversion in here and because of that

503
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,799
these guys may be sitting in in in

504
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,580
pretty poor air quality is a lot of air

505
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,530
pollution so we're going to go through

506
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,970
some of the common air pollutants and

507
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,130
the first one is something called

508
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:10,690
particulate matter which we just

509
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:13,970
abbreviate is PM in particulate matter

510
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,760
our physical chunks of things in the

511
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,710
atmosphere so you can see this stuff so

512
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,440
what do you think of a smoke or dust

513
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:24,049
that haze in the background that's p.m.

514
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,370
and we break p.m. up into two groups

515
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:30,370
based on the size and this number two

516
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,169
and a half and ten refers to how many

517
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:36,770
microns in diameter and a micron is a

518
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:38,750
millionth of a meter and so all we need

519
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,820
to know in this class is that they're

520
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,190
both microscopic but there's one group

521
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,140
that's even tinier than then the other

522
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,070
group so it could be things like pollen

523
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:51,049
grains or salt grains or dust grains or

524
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:54,679
bacteria or mold spores all kinds of

525
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:57,559
things could count as PM and a naturally

526
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:02,840
common naturally occurring one is that a

527
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:04,309
pollen and so pollen grains every

528
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,679
species of plant has a slightly

529
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:10,130
different pollen grain and if you have

530
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:12,770
allergies then you are allergic to

531
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,850
actually the size of the particle it

532
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,140
turns out

533
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,230
so for example the plants that I'm

534
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,370
allergic to have a certain size and they

535
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,170
may not be the plants that you're

536
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,360
allergic to because you're allergic to a

537
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,890
different size so that's why people are

538
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,870
allergic to different things it all

539
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,650
comes down to that the diameter of the

540
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:32,360
pollen now dust itself can be made of a

541
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,700
lot of things and it depends on if

542
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,000
you've got inside desk or outside dust

543
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:40,790
and so an interesting experiment was

544
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
conducted one time there's a museum in

545
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,650
Germany and I don't know what they had

546
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,180
but they were real it was something very

547
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,580
valuable and they didn't want it to get

548
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,230
dusty and so they had like double doors

549
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,850
and you had to change your clothes and

550
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,400
all this stuff and they found out they

551
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,620
kept getting dust on the exhibits so

552
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,300
they analyzed it on the microscope and

553
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,940
they found out that most of the dust was

554
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,920
actually dead skin and it turns out

555
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,860
we're all shedding skin all the time and

556
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,440
if you have a sealed indoor environment

557
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,910
and you go up to something and you you

558
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,740
do this on the wind seal and you got

559
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,820
dust on your finger that's most likely

560
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,440
dead skin and that also means that

561
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,510
you're constantly breathing in little

562
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,530
particles of dead skin from other people

563
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,920
because they're floating around in the

564
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,010
air

565
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,430
now that might gross you out but your

566
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,980
body absorbs those skin flakes and it

567
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:34,580
doesn't hurt you that's better for you

568
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,980
then outside dust because outside dust

569
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,580
is usually a little fragments of rock

570
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,530
and those rock fragments are usually not

571
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,690
soluble in your body so what happens is

572
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,900
you breathe them in and then go into

573
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,760
your lungs and they stay there forever

574
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,190
now here's something called silica dust

575
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,910
so silica is just a it's a group of

576
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:58,130
minerals rocks and minerals and when we

577
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,350
have dust like in New Mexico the dust

578
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,080
storms the haboobs and all that what

579
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:06,650
you're seeing mostly is silica dust and

580
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,840
silica dust has sharp edges so this is

581
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:11,300
bad because you briefed us in it goes

582
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,040
into your lungs it never leaves it web

583
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,230
does itself into your lungs and every

584
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,960
time you breathe it wiggles a little bit

585
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,210
and every time it wiggles and makes scar

586
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,370
tissue and eventually that can lead to

587
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,620
lung cancer this is the same reason that

588
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,399
smokers get lung cancer okay same kind

589
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:30,249
of idea now

590
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,960
you have in your lungs no matter where

591
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:33,729
you live you also have some of these

592
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,399
little you have these little tiny

593
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:39,190
microscopic spheres that are mostly

594
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,599
carbon that come from exhaust a lot of

595
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,469
it comes from diesel engines especially

596
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:48,009
the older ones but we all have them and

597
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:50,259
if you were to cut a lung open and look

598
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:52,690
at it you would see these tiny little

599
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:55,119
black spheres now they're not black in

600
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,710
this image because this is a scanning

601
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,570
electron microscope so they look white

602
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,369
but if you could see them there are

603
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,249
little spheres of mostly carbon

604
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:06,399
surrounded by some sulfur surrounded by

605
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:08,559
some other metals and they're floating

606
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:11,460
around in the atmosphere and in the air

607
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,080
in all cities so we all have them and

608
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,239
when they do autopsies of people who

609
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,009
live in cities their lungs are dirty

610
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:21,309
looking because we breathe so much of

611
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:23,979
this exhaust if patients go into the

612
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:27,059
hospital and they're on a purifier you

613
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:31,479
know air purified air for a couple years

614
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:33,339
their lungs will turn pink so one type

615
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:37,299
of PM that has a long and sordid history

616
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:39,279
is that of asbestos asbestos is a

617
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:40,479
naturally forming mineral this is what

618
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,419
it looks like when it comes out of the

619
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:45,099
ground and you can it looks kind of

620
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:48,129
fuzzy here you can peel it into little

621
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:50,619
fibers so if you did so it would kind of

622
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:52,419
look like this and those fibers have

623
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:54,519
some really unique properties and that

624
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:56,259
for one thing they're fireproof and you

625
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:59,589
can sew them into different products and

626
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:02,619
so starting in the 1800's they started

627
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:05,679
to sew asbestos into fireproof

628
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:07,269
cloth or fireproof blankets and then

629
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,359
eventually they started putting it in

630
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:12,820
into your house so they start using it

631
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:16,719
as insulation your attic fireproof and

632
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,999
in your walls fireproof and all kinds of

633
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:21,519
different products now today there's

634
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:24,099
asbestos in your house but it's embedded

635
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,139
in products it's not freely just out in

636
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:28,659
your your attic like it used to be and

637
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:32,830
the reason for that is because asbestos

638
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:35,349
is very hazardous to breathe and so

639
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,659
under a microscope this is a scanning

640
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:40,299
electron microscope it's asbestos is a

641
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:41,309
bunch of tiny little needles and when

642
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,169
you breathe them in they

643
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,999
you know these are microscopic you can't

644
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,080
even see them you breathe the man they

645
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,990
go into your lungs

646
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,360
they puncture your lung and they embed

647
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,990
themselves in there and they never leave

648
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,240
so your body cannot dissolve them and so

649
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,279
over time what happens is as you breathe

650
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,590
in and out the little fibers wiggle and

651
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,860
create scar tissue and that's what's

652
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:07,499
shown here in the red and eventually

653
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:11,159
this will lead to lung cancer and some

654
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:15,360
other lung related diseases that are due

655
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,340
to breathing in asbestos fibers so we

656
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,999
have a story in this country about a

657
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,619
town in Montana Libby Montana that was

658
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:27,090
formed for the purpose of mining

659
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:29,490
asbestos and asbestos was mined in great

660
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,679
volumes out of Libby we don't really

661
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,080
have any pictures not great pictures of

662
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,509
the mine back in the day but this is

663
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,759
sort of the modern equivalent this is a

664
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:40,440
bestest mine in Canada there's big

665
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,379
trucks down there for scale so it's a

666
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,529
what we call big pit mine so they had

667
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:48,450
something similar to this in Montana and

668
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:51,570
back then they didn't think it was

669
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,340
dangerous and so all this asbestos dust

670
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,460
would go up in the air every single day

671
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,320
and coat the entire town so here's a

672
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,720
picture from the 50s and this white

673
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,610
material you see is asbestos dust

674
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,200
you know the workers would come home

675
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,879
they have asbestos on their clothes and

676
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,559
they brush it off and it's all in the

677
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:10,980
house and everybody's breathing it and

678
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:13,460
as a result hundreds of people just in

679
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,799
that town died from asbestos related

680
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,999
lung disease and so there's a whole

681
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,059
bunch of books that have been written

682
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:23,549
this is just one of them that's recently

683
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,519
been published that detail this this

684
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:30,029
whole asbestos problem from Libby

685
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,889
Montana thousands of people have serious

686
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:34,139
chronic health problems because of this

687
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:37,619
they think as many as 50 million you

688
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:40,470
know us homes have products from Libby

689
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:42,450
Montana in them so it would take a long

690
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,190
time to go over the entire history of

691
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,409
everything that's happened regarding

692
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,690
asbestos bill I'm gonna hit a few of the

693
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:51,450
high points here because the story of

694
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:54,059
asbestos gets repeated for other things

695
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,809
in our country later on so early

696
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,909
eighteen

697
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:59,399
we get the first US patent for asbestos

698
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:02,220
and a company by the name of Johns

699
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:04,200
Manville is formed and Johns Manville

700
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,809
still around today they make insulation

701
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,460
for your house and by the late

702
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:11,370
18-hundreds were mining lots of asbestos

703
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,879
in this country and making things out of

704
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,649
it by 1906 there's a doctor who starts

705
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:18,929
to notice that anybody that works with

706
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:20,940
asbestos seems to die early died

707
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:24,299
prematurely and he publishes a paper

708
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:27,240
about this and more studies are done and

709
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:28,919
by 1918 insurance companies recognize

710
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,230
this is a real threat and they're

711
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,539
refusing to sell health insurance to

712
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,749
people that work with asbestos and by

713
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,580
1922 the US Navy recognizes that it's

714
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:41,399
hazardous requires people to wear

715
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,580
respirators ok so we can establish that

716
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:46,710
by the early 1900's it's already known

717
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:50,340
that asbestos is hazardous to human

718
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:53,009
health ok but we continue to mine in

719
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,899
this country and so as time goes on

720
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:58,320
there's more and more studies about

721
00:29:54,899 --> 00:30:03,179
workers that fall ill due to asbestos

722
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:06,450
and let's see we get to the 1930s some

723
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:09,179
other countries start to pass rate laws

724
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,659
regulating asbestos use not in this

725
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,600
country

726
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,820
in 1936 johns manville that's the

727
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,129
company that's mining this stuff higher

728
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,919
is an independent group to do research

729
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:22,470
to see you know is this really hazardous

730
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,850
material and these independent group of

731
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,379
scientists study and they come back and

732
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,499
they say yeah it's really hazardous and

733
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:31,100
so the executives decide to suppress

734
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:35,369
those studies so they aren't released

735
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:38,129
and then like a similar incident happens

736
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:42,360
a few years later we're where another

737
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:44,759
group studies the effect of asbestos on

738
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,129
mice and they found on 80% of the mice

739
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,960
inhaled asbestos get cancer that

740
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:50,789
research also not published case so

741
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,740
we're gonna see this is also going to be

742
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:56,639
a common theme we're gonna see in this

743
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:58,799
class on some other topics and let's see

744
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:01,919
we've got more studies come out here's

745
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,360
one of note in 1960 that they realized

746
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,970
that not just the people that work with

747
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,610
asbestos but their family members were

748
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,520
getting sick other children were getting

749
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,930
our residents in the town that you know

750
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,100
didn't have anybody in the immediate

751
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,590
family that even worked with asbestos

752
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:21,030
we're getting sick so they realize it's

753
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:25,260
a much broader problem and finally when

754
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:27,330
we get to the early 70s it's finally

755
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,540
listed it listed in this country as a

756
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:32,280
hazardous air pollutant and this is the

757
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,470
first time in this country we finally

758
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,480
recognize that there's something wrong

759
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,480
with asbestos India shouldn't breathe it

760
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,310
realize that this is coming like 60

761
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,060
years after the first papers were

762
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:47,960
published in them in the medical science

763
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:51,320
so from then from that point forward

764
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,360
Congress has tried to pass more

765
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,820
legislation to try to restrict how much

766
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,970
asbestos one can can breathe and be

767
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:03,390
exposed to and so let's see there's a

768
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:07,800
bunch of several things here but as time

769
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:10,590
goes on there are more and more laws

770
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:14,670
being passed regulating the the use in

771
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:17,160
the the mining of asbestos now in 1991 a

772
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,290
bunch of manufacturers of asbestos got

773
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,030
together and challenged the EPA the

774
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,760
Environmental Protection Agency in court

775
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,740
and they got them throw out some of the

776
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,080
rules regarding asbestos okay so the

777
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,980
companies that are mining this stuff are

778
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,590
are fighting against these regulations

779
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:37,590
so as time goes by though eventually the

780
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:40,470
regulations win in 2002 we finally stop

781
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,630
mining asbestos in California now we're

782
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:44,520
about a hundred years past when the the

783
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,010
first studies were shown that it's a

784
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:51,020
very dangerous thing to breathe and I

785
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:54,660
kind of skip a bunch of these but in

786
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:57,480
2010 there was a study that that said

787
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:00,720
that between in a 10-year period between

788
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,180
2000 and 2010 forty three thousand four

789
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,330
hundred sixty four Americans died from

790
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,490
diseases related to the inhalation of

791
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,810
asbestos okay just in that ten years so

792
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,330
these are people that had been exposed

793
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:16,380
like in the past and that's finally

794
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:19,350
catching up to them by 2013 fifty

795
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,960
countries have banned asbestos but us is

796
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,200
not one of them and this reveals kind of

797
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,360
a

798
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,630
problem in our political system which is

799
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,610
that the asbestos industry has a lot of

800
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,800
lobbyists they put a lot of money into

801
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:34,170
the political system to fight some of

802
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,770
these regulations and we've seen the

803
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:40,710
effect of this finally if we jump ahead

804
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,830
so as the years go by we're mining less

805
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,350
and less asbestos in this country per

806
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:50,610
year so the latest number I can find

807
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:52,800
2015 about 360 tons of asbestos in the

808
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:56,880
United States each year it's not zero

809
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:00,390
but point is this is a material that was

810
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,010
deemed hazardous early 1900s and over a

811
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,290
hundred years later there are still

812
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:07,470
people being exposed to it and a big

813
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:09,960
reason for that is lobbyist money big

814
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,210
money gets into the government you can

815
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,250
affect politicians votes and keep things

816
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,430
legal that are actually hazardous to

817
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:19,530
health so this isn't to say that other

818
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:22,800
countries are doing a better job

819
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,750
necessarily so here's a modern asbestos

820
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,450
mine in China all that white material

821
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,330
you see there that's all asbestos fibers

822
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:32,760
and in fact here's some asbestos mining

823
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:34,410
in India these guys just wear a scarf

824
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,200
around their mouth that's their

825
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:39,390
respirator or like this guy he's got a

826
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,850
handkerchief I have no idea how many

827
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:43,050
fibers they're breathing in but I don't

828
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,910
know how you know we don't know how long

829
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:48,360
these guys are going to live but they're

830
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:51,720
currently being exposed so as a side

831
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,550
note the fact that we have millions of

832
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,590
buildings in this country with asbestos

833
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,170
in them sparked a new industry called

834
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:00,720
the asbestos abatement industry which is

835
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,820
that a company will go into a building

836
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,980
usually it's a private building like a

837
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,680
school or a hospital something like that

838
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,500
and they will pull all the asbestos out

839
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,850
of all the places that it was originally

840
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,250
put in you know as insulation and it's a

841
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,420
very expensive process so here what

842
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,490
they're doing is they're pulling out the

843
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,040
asbestos that used to be up here in

844
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:25,710
these joists and you know all dressed up

845
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,690
in their bunny suits and etc and what's

846
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,520
in these bags are these easy the

847
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:32,700
asbestos fibers that they're removing

848
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,580
well one of the problems of doing this

849
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,150
is that once the asbestos is in the

850
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,640
building

851
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,800
and behind the walls and nobody's

852
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,020
messing with it it's really not that bad

853
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,670
but when you go and you start digging it

854
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,270
out you raise all kinds of asbestos

855
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:50,010
fibers again and it's been shown that

856
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,540
asbestos abatement probably just makes

857
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,450
the problem worse it's not really

858
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,160
necessary and the act of going in there

859
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,380
and doing that raises a lot of asbestos

860
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,680
dust so some people have argued that

861
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,360
this is totally unnecessary but now this

862
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,680
is an industry that has a lot of money

863
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:10,710
behind it and it keeps on going so we're

864
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,960
going to look at p.m. on earth little

865
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,510
Schoolnet and the way I do that is I

866
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,880
click the word earth and I click on

867
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,800
particulates and this is going to show

868
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,040
me a lot of the PM that's in the air

869
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,320
today and I can look around and I can

870
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,780
see that there's some swirls of

871
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:31,530
particulate matter across the United

872
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,260
States I can look around the world and

873
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:36,270
there's a bunch usually in China which

874
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,290
we're kind of seeing here they've got a

875
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:44,310
lot of you know a lot of smoke but

876
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:46,680
notice what's happening over here and so

877
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,100
this is Africa and in the northern part

878
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,950
of Africa there's this huge plume of PM

879
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,030
and if you can notice this but the wind

880
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,370
well you can't see it so much today but

881
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:59,550
the wind is blowing it off the continent

882
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,550
and it's headed across the ocean you

883
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:06,600
also see it over here in the Middle East

884
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:08,970
so normally on a normal day the most PM

885
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,800
you will see on earth is here northern

886
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:14,250
Africa in the Middle East now why is

887
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,700
that so this is actually naturally

888
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:20,670
occurring for the most part North Africa

889
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,370
is very dry and when so this is the

890
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:26,280
Sahara Desert and wind blows dust off

891
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:28,650
the continent into these big plumes that

892
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,970
go across the ocean so these winds are

893
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,790
called the easterlies they're bringing

894
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:35,910
dust across the ocean and it'll actually

895
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,300
land over here in South America now this

896
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:41,840
is important because South America right

897
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,190
here this is the Amazon rainforest right

898
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,200
and so one of the problems with rain

899
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,600
forests is because they rain so much

900
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,560
there's almost no soil the soil

901
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,660
dissolves away

902
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,470
from all the rain it's really hard to

903
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,630
maintain soil what you need to maintain

904
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:00,540
rain forests in a place where it rains a

905
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:03,930
lot well here what's happening is very

906
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,450
slowly over time dust is blown off the

907
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,370
continent from Africa it travels all the

908
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,600
way across the ocean and it falls out

909
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:16,980
over South America and very slowly adds

910
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:20,760
to the floor of the rain forests so in a

911
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:23,330
way the dust from Africa is fertilizing

912
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,730
the rain forests of South America

913
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:29,880
so that's p.m. now we can also break it

914
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:33,510
down further and we can look at say p.m.

915
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:38,100
two and a half and we can see a few more

916
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:41,430
details you can you can see particulates

917
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:44,580
coming from different sources some of

918
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,870
these are fires some of these are cities

919
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,330
with there's a lot of smoke that's

920
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,370
probably Mexico City right there if you

921
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:53,970
go to say South America we see these

922
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:56,280
spots those are probably all fires in

923
00:38:53,970 --> 00:39:00,450
Central Africa so there's the the Sahara

924
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,580
dust but we see a lot of dust from fires

925
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:05,880
from slash-and-burn practices that we'll

926
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:08,490
talk about more in a second and look at

927
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,320
India and look at China a lot of air

928
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,570
pollution in the particulates here and

929
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,040
most of that is just industrial you know

930
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:19,710
people burning things that's what most

931
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:22,920
of that is so the next flute and on our

932
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:26,250
list is VOCs which stands for volatile

933
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,790
organic compound now volatile in this

934
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:31,440
case means it evaporates fairly easily

935
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,510
organic doesn't mean it comes from whole

936
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,580
foods it means that it's made of carbon

937
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,830
and that's just a different use of the

938
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,080
word organic compound it has several

939
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:42,300
atoms in it now it turns out that our

940
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,330
nose and brain are set up that we can

941
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:48,570
smell most VOCs here's an example

942
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:50,310
acetone so acetone there this is what

943
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,350
the chemical structure looks like there

944
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:55,560
is your carbon so that's why it's called

945
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:57,630
organic and ladies you know this as

946
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,880
fingernail polish remover you know when

947
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,850
as soon as you remove the lid super

948
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,660
stinky right that's a vo see

949
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:09,630
things like gasoline paint those are all

950
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:13,260
VOCs and usually you can smell them

951
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:15,270
quite easily now most of the VOCs that

952
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,900
we have in the air here in New Mexico

953
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:22,560
come from the gas and oil fields so a

954
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:26,780
lot of times what happens is that we

955
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,490
royal forms it rises to these natural

956
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,190
pockets in the crust so this is called

957
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:34,320
an anticline now the gas will often

958
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,170
accumulate at the top of the pocket and

959
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,359
the oil is a little bit below that so if

960
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,359
they're drilling they might be drilling

961
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,950
to get the gas on purpose and sometimes

962
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,020
when that happens some of it gets out

963
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:48,359
and gets into the atmosphere sometimes

964
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,270
they're after the oil and the gases are

965
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:53,070
just kind of in the way either way a lot

966
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:57,690
of times the gas leaks out and gets into

967
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:59,730
the atmosphere so here's a pumpjack so

968
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,890
it's job is to pump petroleum which is a

969
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:04,500
liquid but if you've been by one of

970
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,150
these there's an odor in the air and a

971
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,980
lot of what you're smelling or VOCs

972
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,640
there's natural gas coming out of this

973
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,490
well a little bit here's a natural gas

974
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,430
well so they've dug a hole and they

975
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,530
basically did is put in a valve and

976
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,510
natural gas comes out of this pipe and

977
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,310
then it goes on to a processing plant

978
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,500
but there's also natural gas kind of

979
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,050
seeping out of the ground around where

980
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,910
this well was built

981
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:32,760
now once natural gas comes out of the

982
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,619
ground they can't just directly sell it

983
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,960
to you for your gas stove they've got a

984
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,420
it's got to go through a few steps it's

985
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,040
got to be purified and clean separate it

986
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,410
out into different components sometimes

987
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,660
and then they got to compress it and

988
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:48,660
they push it down a pipe so maybe

989
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,270
there's a gas what you know one of these

990
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,830
over like Carlsbad and then the way it

991
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,630
gets to Albuquerque is there's an

992
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:58,320
underground pipe that takes it all the

993
00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:00,690
way from Carlsbad to Albuquerque and so

994
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,220
a gas plant is kind of the first stage

995
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,020
in that where they separate out the

996
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,270
different components and purify it and

997
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,430
then in order to get it all the way to

998
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,500
Albuquerque down the pipe they've got to

999
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,270
compress it in several different places

1000
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,790
along the way those are called gas

1001
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:16,799
compressor stations and each one of

1002
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,349
these a little bit is lost

1003
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:21,690
in in the atmosphere and in the gas

1004
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:27,059
plants and the gas compressor stations

1005
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:29,039
and then a lot of times again if they're

1006
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:31,410
after oil and they don't want the gas

1007
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,910
they still have to do something with it

1008
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,739
so a lot of times they'll just burn it

1009
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,329
that's called flaring so what's

1010
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:38,729
happening here is they're trying to get

1011
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:41,279
petroleum but they also got some gas

1012
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:43,680
that came out with it but it's not worth

1013
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:46,109
the effort and the money to try to you

1014
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,559
know compress it and clean it all that

1015
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:51,660
so they just rather burn it so that also

1016
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:55,589
emits some VOCs into the atmosphere also

1017
00:42:51,660 --> 00:43:00,239
some PM there's a lot of PM in in in

1018
00:42:55,589 --> 00:43:03,720
these black clouds here then another

1019
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,910
source of vo C is the refinery so

1020
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,880
refineries are where we take petroleum

1021
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:10,619
and we basically put it under vessels of

1022
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,259
pressure and heat and we separate out

1023
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:16,920
we're all petroleum oil crude oil into

1024
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:20,009
the different components so gasoline

1025
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,950
diesel kerosene all those things come

1026
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:24,989
from crude petroleum but they have to be

1027
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:29,519
processed in a refinery to make those

1028
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:31,739
products and so in that process a lot of

1029
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,479
VOCs are emitted to the atmosphere and

1030
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:37,319
in New Mexico we have a couple

1031
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:39,210
refineries one you may have been exposed

1032
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:41,640
to is in Artesia if you've ever been

1033
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,410
through the town of Artesia it has a

1034
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,269
particular odor and what you're smelling

1035
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,269
or VOCs and they're coming from this

1036
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:50,219
refinery so the Navajo refinery is

1037
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:51,479
official name of this and it's right in

1038
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:52,469
the middle of town you drive right by it

1039
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:57,739
and you can smell it

1040
00:43:52,469 --> 00:44:01,319
those are VOCs moving on to our next

1041
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:03,539
pollutant is sulfur dioxide and sulfur

1042
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:07,170
is in a lot of fossil fuels so when you

1043
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:09,569
burn fossil fuels so2 is a common

1044
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:11,819
byproduct he burned coal you burn

1045
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:14,190
gasoline you burn diesel you produce

1046
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:17,759
sulfur now one of the problems is that

1047
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,410
sulfur by itself isn't quite that

1048
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:21,569
harmful but once it gets into the

1049
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,630
atmosphere you know combined with water

1050
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:26,579
molecules and form sulfuric acid that

1051
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,440
sulfuric acid that's floating around in

1052
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,090
the atmosphere then condenses to form

1053
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,040
rain and you get

1054
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:38,070
Sidda crane so here is some clouds that

1055
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,210
are forming here's a plume of sulfur

1056
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:45,300
dioxide that's actually forming clouds

1057
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:47,580
that are acidic so these so we know that

1058
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,980
cumulus clouds don't rain but if they

1059
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:54,060
were to produce rain you get very acidic

1060
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,600
rain coming out of these clouds now acid

1061
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,060
rain

1062
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,310
used to be a really big deal and today

1063
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,820
our big environmental problem is global

1064
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:05,210
warming in the 80s it was the ozone hole

1065
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:08,880
you go back 100 years it was acid rain

1066
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:10,650
acid rain stresses vegetation so the

1067
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,650
branch on the Left has been exposed to

1068
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:18,780
acidic rain and you can see it's not not

1069
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:20,790
doing so well in fact when in in the

1070
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,550
late 1800s people started burning lots

1071
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:25,050
of coal in steam engines and then

1072
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,240
eventually people started produce

1073
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:30,630
electricity there's a lot of coal being

1074
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,550
burned and producing a lot of sulfur it

1075
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,570
went out into the atmosphere made a lot

1076
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:38,790
of acid rain and there are entire swaths

1077
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,920
of forests in Europe that were killed

1078
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,050
because of acid rain and you can still

1079
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,210
see them today they're starting to come

1080
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:47,700
back but there are places where there's

1081
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:50,490
just millions of acres of dead trees

1082
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:54,570
from acid rain and most of this occurred

1083
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:56,660
in the late 1800s Early 1900s another

1084
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:59,610
thing that happens is that acid rain

1085
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:02,250
reacts with limestone and marble and

1086
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:07,230
dissolves it so here's a marble statue

1087
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:09,510
that was carved in 1702 and 1908

1088
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,720
this is what it looks like so it's been

1089
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:15,210
around 200 years at this point

1090
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,970
1968 notice that it looks like someone

1091
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,670
just took an eraser to it and acid rain

1092
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:23,700
basically dissolved away this statue and

1093
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:27,090
we've lost a lot of statues worldwide to

1094
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:29,520
acidic rain here's another example this

1095
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:32,420
is something called an obelisk it's made

1096
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,890
out of limestone and it's from Egypt and

1097
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,230
it was carved out of limestone about

1098
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,660
3,000 years ago and you can see the

1099
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:42,260
hieroglyphics in this old picture this

1100
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,140
is what it looked like in 1884

1101
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:47,780
there was a point in history where it

1102
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,300
was okay for cities just go to Egypt and

1103
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,100
take things and so New York City just

1104
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,770
decided hey that would be cool to have

1105
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:57,170
that in Central Park so they took it and

1106
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:59,930
they put it in Central Park and you'll

1107
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:02,270
notice that a lot of the hieroglyphics

1108
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,860
are not recognizable anymore in fact

1109
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,710
this is what it looks like up close it

1110
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,660
has this kind of pockmarked texture

1111
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:11,270
acid rain dissolved away a lot of the

1112
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,460
hieroglyphics in that 3000 year old

1113
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:16,160
obelisk and it just happened within like

1114
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,860
you know a hundred years so we're going

1115
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,570
to return now to earth nil Schoolnet and

1116
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,780
we're gonna look for sulfur so I click

1117
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:29,230
the word earth in under mode I'm going

1118
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:32,630
to chem and then under overlay at so2

1119
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:35,950
okay so now the colors represent sulfur

1120
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:39,680
dioxide emissions and if i zoom in here

1121
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:43,970
across the US I can see a whole bunch of

1122
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,710
little red dots with tails every one of

1123
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,930
those is a coal-fired power plant

1124
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:51,050
including some here in New Mexico so

1125
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:53,480
coal has sulfur in it and in this

1126
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,310
country coal-fired power plants are

1127
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,510
required to remove at least some of the

1128
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:01,340
sulfur out of the the exhaust but some

1129
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:03,290
of it still gets into the atmosphere and

1130
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:05,180
that's what all these red dots are so in

1131
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,250
the eastern part of the country there's

1132
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,900
a whole lot more Coal Fired power plants

1133
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:14,260
than there are in the West so we see a

1134
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:17,260
lot more sulfur emissions out there but

1135
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:23,590
let's look around the world here

1136
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:29,270
how much happening in Africa but oh boy

1137
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:31,400
look at China so China has a lot of

1138
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:34,250
coal-fired power plants and they don't

1139
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,320
have the emission regulations that we do

1140
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,850
so they emit a lot more sulfur than we

1141
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,320
do and you can see on here there's just

1142
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,330
a bright purple blob

1143
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,420
you know India's got a fair amount -

1144
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:49,490
right but China really has most of the

1145
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:51,910
sulfur emissions right now also you

1146
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,329
might notice let's see if we can find it

1147
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:58,259
here's some

1148
00:48:54,329 --> 00:49:01,170
see these stripes like that stripe right

1149
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:05,099
there it goes across the ocean here's

1150
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:08,069
another one that's stripe do you know

1151
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:12,449
why there might be stripes of sulfur out

1152
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:14,519
in the ocean so those stripes of sulfur

1153
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:17,849
dioxide that are out in the ocean

1154
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:20,069
those are shipping lanes and out in the

1155
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:23,219
ocean there are these giant container

1156
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:25,499
ships just about anything you've ever

1157
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:28,619
bought has been on a container ship at

1158
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:29,999
some point in its life and these things

1159
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,579
are out in the ocean they're enormous

1160
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:34,949
they have giant engines and they burn

1161
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:37,229
really cheap fuel that has a lot of

1162
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:39,089
sulfur in it the reason they can get

1163
00:49:37,229 --> 00:49:41,069
away with this is because out in the

1164
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:44,519
open ocean there's no pollution laws

1165
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:47,309
when you're 200 nautical miles from the

1166
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:50,880
shoreline then the the country in

1167
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:53,609
question there air pollution laws apply

1168
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,670
but on the rest of the ocean there's no

1169
00:49:53,609 --> 00:50:00,650
loss and so these big container ships

1170
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:04,019
really pollute and put it in perspective

1171
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:06,989
15 of these big container ships produced

1172
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:11,189
as much so2 as all of the cars in the

1173
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:13,380
world combined okay and then figure well

1174
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:15,920
there's 6,000 of those giant container

1175
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,749
ships out in the ocean right now and

1176
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,479
85,000 commercial ships that are

1177
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:23,339
currently in use so there's a lot of air

1178
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:27,269
pollution out in the ocean from these

1179
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:29,670
giant ships next one on our list is

1180
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:31,890
oxides of nitrogen which we abbreviate

1181
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:35,160
as knocks knocks are two different

1182
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:37,739
molecules n o and no2 you get them when

1183
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:41,130
you burn fuel at high temperatures so

1184
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:43,439
for example a car engine burns gasoline

1185
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:46,619
at pretty high temperature it produces

1186
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:49,349
NOx and when you if you live in an area

1187
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:51,869
where you have to get your car emissions

1188
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:54,660
tested NOx is one of the things that

1189
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:57,329
they're testing for well one of the

1190
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:00,299
problems with NOx is that it combines

1191
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:02,819
with atmospheric water vapor to produce

1192
00:51:00,299 --> 00:51:05,489
an acid in the similar way that sulfur

1193
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:07,380
does except instead of sulfuric acid it

1194
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:12,200
produces something called nitric acid

1195
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,200
and this also contributes to acid rain

1196
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:17,579
ozone so we've talked about ozone in the

1197
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:19,410
stratosphere and we say this is

1198
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:21,690
wonderful marvelous thing that protects

1199
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:25,019
us down here from UV gotta have it

1200
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:27,119
however there's a second source of ozone

1201
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:29,460
that's not natural it's down here at the

1202
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,599
surface and it's really really bad for

1203
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:38,309
you pure oxygen o2 is an oxidizing

1204
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:40,410
compound o 3 is an especially oxidizing

1205
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:42,660
compound if you breathe in o 3 it

1206
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:45,990
attacks all the tissues in your body and

1207
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:48,750
it's a major lung irritant and the way

1208
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:53,549
you get ozone at the surface is if you

1209
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:56,279
have VOCs + NOx in the presence of

1210
00:51:53,549 --> 00:52:00,589
sunlight those three things will react

1211
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:03,150
for to produce ozone so some big cities

1212
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:04,619
especially those that have you know

1213
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,200
temperature inversions like we've been

1214
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:10,259
talking about they'll issue ozone

1215
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,720
warnings and basically don't go outside

1216
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:14,309
because the ozone is so bad now in

1217
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,289
Albuquerque we don't really have that

1218
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:18,809
problem here we don't have enough air

1219
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:21,210
pollution that ozone really ever becomes

1220
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:24,089
an issue but some cities everyday

1221
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:26,519
there's some sort of ozone reading or

1222
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:29,089
ozone warning that gets a community

1223
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,920
communicated to the public

1224
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:34,529
carbon monoxide next on our list

1225
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:39,869
carbon monoxide is sometimes often

1226
00:52:34,529 --> 00:52:40,730
confused with co2 okay CO vs. co2 two

1227
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:43,769
different things

1228
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,970
carbon monoxide like almost everything

1229
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:48,660
we've been talking about here is a

1230
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:50,910
product of burning feel so carbon

1231
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:54,450
monoxide you can't see it you can't

1232
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:57,119
smell it but it's poisonous and what

1233
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:59,250
happens is normally when you breathe in

1234
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,329
oxygen oxygen goes into your bloodstream

1235
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:04,829
it finds a red blood cell it attaches to

1236
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:06,900
a certain place in the red blood cell

1237
00:53:04,829 --> 00:53:09,799
there's some electrons exchanged and

1238
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:13,799
then it leaves as a carbon dioxide okay

1239
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:16,349
carbon monoxide comes in finds that spot

1240
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:20,009
on your red blood cell attaches itself

1241
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:21,160
and stays there and so that red blood

1242
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:23,740
cell no longer

1243
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,480
can operate as a red blood cell and so

1244
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,000
as you breathe in carbon monoxide what

1245
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,339
happens is all the receptors in your red

1246
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,460
blood cells become choked with these

1247
00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:36,010
carbon monoxide molecules now your

1248
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:39,250
experience is you start to get sleepy

1249
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:41,579
right so what's happening is you're

1250
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:44,109
slowly become becoming suffocated and

1251
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:46,510
eventually is also sleepy able to take a

1252
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:47,619
nap and you never wake up that's carbon

1253
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:49,900
monoxide poisoning

1254
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:51,339
so people that commit suicide by

1255
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,650
breathing car exhaust in the garage

1256
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:55,630
what's actually killing them is the

1257
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:58,990
carbon monoxide okay it's coming out of

1258
00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:01,599
all car exhaust so we're going to go to

1259
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:04,920
earth Donnell Schoolnet and look at some

1260
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:10,299
carbon monoxide so mode is still kim

1261
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:13,329
overlay I'm changing the co and now the

1262
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:15,730
bright spots are plumes of carbon

1263
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:19,329
monoxide it looks like here we maybe got

1264
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:21,569
some fires that's probably just

1265
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:26,740
automobile exhaust from New York City

1266
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:31,750
automobile exhaust from LA Chicago let's

1267
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:33,880
look down here okay so here we are in

1268
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:37,390
South America and there's this cluster

1269
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,520
of these plumes of carbon monoxide every

1270
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,700
one of those dots and these are fires

1271
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:45,339
and these are fires started by humans

1272
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:49,020
because what we're looking at is what we

1273
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:51,520
call slash and burn agriculture so

1274
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:54,670
Americans like hamburgers hamburgers

1275
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:58,089
come from cows and if you want to grow

1276
00:54:54,670 --> 00:55:01,539
cows in another country you can't do it

1277
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:03,640
in rainforests so cows like grass so

1278
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:06,430
what they do is they chop down the

1279
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:09,700
rainforests and they burn it and then

1280
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:12,309
they grow grass but as we said a few

1281
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,150
minutes ago there's not much soil in the

1282
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,099
rainforest

1283
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:17,170
so grass doesn't last very long so you

1284
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:20,410
get a couple seasons of grass out of it

1285
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:23,279
and then the cows need to move on so you

1286
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:26,890
got to chop more rainforests down and

1287
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:30,099
repeat the process so this is all

1288
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:32,799
agriculture practices here mostly it's a

1289
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:34,569
grow cattle to sell to us in fact if we

1290
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,779
look over here in Africa okay we got

1291
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:36,819
some

1292
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:40,150
more over here so each one of these

1293
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:41,859
little spots is a place where those it's

1294
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:46,829
a fire do the slash and burn for the

1295
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:52,689
most part so let's see here

1296
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:54,699
there's India Oh China he never failed

1297
00:55:52,689 --> 00:55:57,640
disappoint so a lot of carbon monoxide

1298
00:55:54,699 --> 00:55:59,679
emissions from China today so again

1299
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,880
that's you know mostly it's all from

1300
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,709
burning fuel so whether that's

1301
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,439
coal-fired power plants or automobiles

1302
00:56:02,709 --> 00:56:08,499
or factories or something that's what's

1303
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:11,019
causing it so it looks like today the

1304
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:15,130
world record holder for C Co emissions

1305
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:17,739
is China once again so next up on our

1306
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:20,829
list of air pollutants are the heavy

1307
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:22,959
metals lead which is pretty soft and

1308
00:56:20,829 --> 00:56:25,839
mercury which is liquid at room

1309
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:27,999
temperature it may not make sense that

1310
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,650
you could have heavy metals in the air

1311
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:32,679
but there's a couple ways that could

1312
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,989
happen with lead he used to be that lead

1313
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:36,519
was in gasoline and they put it in

1314
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:40,900
gasoline because it was a cheap way of

1315
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:41,769
raising the octane level and so for 75

1316
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,229
years or so

1317
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:45,999
we burned lead gasoline in our cars and

1318
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:48,669
all that lead went out into the

1319
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:50,559
atmosphere so much so that there's

1320
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:53,699
really almost no place you can go on

1321
00:56:50,559 --> 00:57:00,189
earth now and not find lead in the soil

1322
00:56:53,699 --> 00:57:02,199
so in the 80s we started to phase out

1323
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:05,079
leaded gasoline so for a while you could

1324
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:07,630
buy regular gas which meant it had lead

1325
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:10,059
in it and then the unleaded and then

1326
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:11,859
about a decade after that they got rid

1327
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,929
of the leaded gasoline altogether and

1328
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:17,380
your only choice now is unleaded at

1329
00:57:13,929 --> 00:57:20,499
least for cars in this country what also

1330
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:23,140
was in all paint it forms compounds

1331
00:57:20,499 --> 00:57:25,809
they're very colorful so they used to

1332
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:27,839
use lead to make the pigment and so what

1333
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:31,929
would happen is they would paint a house

1334
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:33,729
with lead-based paint and then the paint

1335
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:35,859
would chip off over time and flutter

1336
00:57:33,729 --> 00:57:40,419
away into the wind and you could get led

1337
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:42,849
into the atmosphere that way so and the

1338
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:45,309
recent year or so Flint Michigan has

1339
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:47,769
been in the news about the lead in their

1340
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:48,579
water but there's actually a lot of

1341
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:51,880
places that have

1342
00:57:48,579 --> 00:57:54,489
led problems and this map you can

1343
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,709
explore if you want and you can find

1344
00:57:54,489 --> 00:57:58,179
where you live and it'll tell you how

1345
00:57:56,709 --> 00:58:01,539
much lead is in the environment

1346
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:03,819
if you zoom zoom in on Albuquerque you

1347
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:05,859
see there's a lot of red zones here

1348
00:58:03,819 --> 00:58:07,719
around Albuquerque and these are

1349
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:08,829
neighborhoods most of these are

1350
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:11,170
neighborhoods that were built with

1351
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:14,439
lead-based paint including the house

1352
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:16,420
that this is being recorded in so this

1353
00:58:14,439 --> 00:58:18,819
has led all over the environments in the

1354
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,519
water in the paint in the soil whatever

1355
00:58:18,819 --> 00:58:24,759
right now we're talking about lead as an

1356
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:27,069
air pollutant only now mercury can also

1357
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:29,529
get into the air because it's naturally

1358
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:31,209
occurring in coal so here's a coal-fired

1359
00:58:29,529 --> 00:58:33,849
power plant there's a big pile of coal

1360
00:58:31,209 --> 00:58:35,410
there they're going to burn and in an

1361
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:37,749
earlier lecture we talked about how

1362
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,969
water vapor condenses out to make a

1363
00:58:37,749 --> 00:58:42,609
little cloud that's from burning

1364
00:58:39,969 --> 00:58:44,559
hydrocarbons in the coal but what's also

1365
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:46,929
coming out of the chimney is mercury and

1366
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,569
so every coal-fired power plant is

1367
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:54,609
putting a little bit of mercury into the

1368
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:57,789
atmosphere now mercury ends up in the

1369
00:58:54,609 --> 00:59:00,549
ecosystem and can get concentrated in

1370
00:58:57,789 --> 00:59:02,499
certain organisms like fish so somehow

1371
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:04,749
or another the biology of fish is such

1372
00:59:02,499 --> 00:59:06,969
that mercury gets concentrated in fish

1373
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:09,759
tissues and there's places where the

1374
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:10,479
fish have so much mercury that you can't

1375
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:13,209
eat the fish

1376
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:16,239
so mercury is a neurotoxin it causes

1377
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:20,229
brain cancer among other things and so

1378
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:23,769
if you eat fish it's wise to pick fish

1379
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:26,170
that don't eat other fish okay so for

1380
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:28,719
example a big fish that are predators

1381
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:30,549
that eat other fish they end up with

1382
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,769
more mercury in their bodies it gets

1383
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:34,539
concentrated in their bodies you're

1384
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:36,849
healthier fish are the ones that don't

1385
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:38,410
eat other fish but maybe eat insects or

1386
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:40,929
something like that so your salmon

1387
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:43,420
steelhead etc those are healthier fish

1388
00:59:40,929 --> 00:59:45,160
this is especially true if you're

1389
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,199
pregnant so if you think you're pregnant

1390
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,269
don't eat tuna okay

1391
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,479
because tuna has measure amounts of

1392
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:54,910
mercury in it so a lot of people may not

1393
00:59:52,479 --> 00:59:56,829
realize this but a lot of the big

1394
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:59,349
American cities went through a period of

1395
00:59:56,829 --> 01:00:01,810
time where the air pollution got so bad

1396
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:03,670
that they're almost uninhabitable

1397
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:06,790
and these pictures are from the 40s 50s

1398
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:09,310
and 60s of some cities like Los Angeles

1399
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:12,210
in San Francisco New York and what looks

1400
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:14,770
like fog is actually air pollution and

1401
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:15,070
it became really unpleasant to live

1402
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,680
there

1403
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:19,180
you know everybody's eyes are burning

1404
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:22,450
you couldn't see the buildings it was

1405
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:24,850
really not pleasant to be outside and so

1406
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:28,060
finally Congress decides to do something

1407
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:29,320
about it starting in the 50s and it

1408
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:31,900
starts out with something called the air

1409
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,840
pollution control act and it really

1410
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:36,610
didn't do much by today's standards it

1411
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,920
gave the Surgeon General permission to

1412
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:40,810
distribute information about air

1413
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:46,420
pollution like that's a big nothing but

1414
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:48,340
baby steps okay and then 1963 they

1415
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:50,020
established something called the clean

1416
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,270
air act and this is going to at first

1417
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:54,580
doesn't have any teeth really but it's

1418
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:56,350
going to grow in later years and at

1419
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,720
first all it does is it establishes a

1420
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:01,300
federal program to study air pollution

1421
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,130
but so far people can still pollute as

1422
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,080
much as they want in fact here's a

1423
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:07,810
picture from 1970 this is a battery

1424
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,900
processing plant big plumes of black

1425
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:12,160
acrid smoke going out in the atmosphere

1426
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,860
completely legal there's no laws

1427
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:18,310
regarding air pollution at that point

1428
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:20,950
now in the 1960s there's there's going

1429
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:23,950
to be some laws that start to come into

1430
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:26,950
effect regarding air pollution with cars

1431
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:29,710
so the first amendment to the Clean Air

1432
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:31,690
Act occurs in 1965 called the motor

1433
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:34,060
vehicle Air Pollution Control Act and

1434
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:37,600
what it said is that cars that are going

1435
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:40,360
to start being built in 1968 have to be

1436
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:45,610
cleaner than the previous models that

1437
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:49,300
compared to a 1963 car have to emit 72

1438
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:51,730
percent less VOCs and 56 percent less

1439
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,130
carbon monoxide okay so that's the very

1440
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:57,250
first time there's a law regarding air

1441
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:59,440
pollution with cars so prior to 1968

1442
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:02,610
cars could put as much as they wanted

1443
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,810
there was no laws regarding that well a

1444
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:08,080
lot of things are happening in the late

1445
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:10,360
sixties early seventies regarding air

1446
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,270
pollution in fact regarding pollution in

1447
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,890
general there is this sort of

1448
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,550
environmental movement afoot and people

1449
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:17,920
were protest

1450
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:20,440
thing about the quality the poor quality

1451
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,290
of the air so here's some photos from

1452
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:25,240
from those times and there's a bunch of

1453
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:28,300
Luther laws or kind of being passed but

1454
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:32,050
in 1970 the established Environmental

1455
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:34,480
Protection Agency so this is an agency

1456
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,820
that's designed to be in charge of all

1457
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,130
these environmental problems ok so prior

1458
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,440
to 1970 there are a bunch of the laws

1459
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:43,780
some regarding air some with water or

1460
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,180
some with wildlife and they were taken

1461
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:48,040
up by different agencies and and the EPA

1462
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,700
was supposed to head all of those things

1463
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,670
okay

1464
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:56,140
consolidate all those different laws so

1465
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:57,850
that happens in 1970 then the same year

1466
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:00,490
there are amendments to that Clean Air

1467
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:03,070
Act the one that they started in 1963

1468
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:04,390
and this is where they introduced the

1469
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:08,020
list of pollutants that we've been

1470
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:10,240
talking about p.m. VOCs so2 these are

1471
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:14,470
things that now can be regulated for the

1472
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:18,610
first time ever all right and this law

1473
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:21,610
becomes amended in the future so there's

1474
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:24,610
amendments in 1977 those amendments in

1475
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:26,590
1990 and what happens throughout time is

1476
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:29,200
that more and more air pollutants are

1477
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:32,080
added to the list so we went over some

1478
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:34,150
one that the big ones right so2 carbon

1479
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:36,370
monoxide those things as time has gone

1480
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:38,950
on more pollutants have been added to

1481
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:40,630
the list and more regulations about how

1482
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:45,910
much you're allowed to emit into the

1483
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:48,760
atmosphere well as a result of this so

1484
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:50,890
here's a graph starts in 1980 goes to

1485
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,190
the year 2013 and it's got a bunch of

1486
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:56,800
things on here but this Green Line is

1487
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:59,860
the the big pollutants that we've talked

1488
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:04,420
about okay VOCs p.m. all those things

1489
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:08,260
they've gone down since 1980 to 2013 by

1490
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:10,600
62% so there's 62% less of those

1491
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:15,250
emissions going into the air compared to

1492
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:17,440
1980 during that same time we have more

1493
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,210
people we have more cars

1494
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,970
we're traveling more miles we're using

1495
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:25,180
more electricity so even though there's

1496
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:27,790
more of us driving more owning more cars

1497
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:29,140
the amount of actual air pollution has

1498
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:32,700
been going down

1499
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,700
and this is because of the Clean Air Act

1500
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:38,590
another way you can measure this are in

1501
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,540
the amount of smoggy days so this is in

1502
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:42,250
the Bay Area so near San Francisco and

1503
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:45,610
they were keeping track of how many days

1504
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:49,090
of really hazardous smog that they had

1505
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:50,350
so this is 1969 and you can see they've

1506
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:53,280
gotten you know someone who looks like

1507
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:55,630
about 65 days of really extreme smog and

1508
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:59,230
over time you know there's good years

1509
01:04:55,630 --> 01:05:02,980
and bad years but they start to hit days

1510
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:05,170
with zero days of really intense smog

1511
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,550
and again this is due to the Clean Air

1512
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:08,200
Act there's more people there today

1513
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,850
there's more cars there today

1514
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,710
that their air is actually been getting

1515
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:15,940
cleaner and you can see photographs of

1516
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:18,520
this this is LA 1968 versus LA 2005

1517
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:21,360
right so the Clean Air Act and these

1518
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,650
these rules actually had a big impact

1519
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:25,630
cars have been getting cleaner and

1520
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:27,490
cleaner every year so every couple years

1521
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,650
manufacturers have been required to

1522
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:33,130
produce automobiles that pollute less

1523
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:34,960
and less you may not know this but there

1524
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,760
are machines that will be set up on the

1525
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,920
side of the road that will measure the

1526
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,260
pollution of your car we don't really

1527
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:44,380
use them so much in New Mexico but they

1528
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:46,660
do this in California and this is data

1529
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:49,960
from Phoenix so what they're looking for

1530
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:51,700
is their so car drives by and it's

1531
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,110
measuring the pollution of the car that

1532
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:55,060
just drove by right that's what it's

1533
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,890
measuring so it's measuring vo C and NOx

1534
01:05:55,060 --> 01:06:01,780
and there's three different kinds of

1535
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:04,480
cars here SUV's pickups small cars or

1536
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:07,540
sorry small pickups and then just cars

1537
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:11,050
and what you notice from 1981 to 1999

1538
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:14,350
that the amount of VOCs are going down

1539
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:16,870
in the amount of NOx going down okay and

1540
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:19,450
so that again that's due the regulation

1541
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:22,030
from the Clean Air Act manufacturers are

1542
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:27,280
required to meet these certain standards

1543
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:29,410
for air pollution so without making

1544
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:32,740
things political we have to talk about

1545
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:35,410
making things political because we're in

1546
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:36,790
a very weird time and I don't know when

1547
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:39,910
you're going to watch this but I'm

1548
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:41,560
recording this in early 2008 and we've

1549
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,339
had the Trump administration now for a

1550
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,999
year

1551
01:06:42,339 --> 01:06:46,749
and things are changing things are

1552
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:50,529
chaotic

1553
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:52,839
so without diving too deep into it let's

1554
01:06:50,529 --> 01:06:55,209
talk about a couple of things if you

1555
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:56,799
took this class ten years ago we would

1556
01:06:55,209 --> 01:06:59,199
talk about the Clean Air Act we talked

1557
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:01,029
about the rules every year things are

1558
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,489
getting better every year the air is

1559
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:06,430
getting cleaner right but now

1560
01:07:03,489 --> 01:07:10,469
everything's in flux and so one of the

1561
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:12,969
things that's happened is a Trump has

1562
01:07:10,469 --> 01:07:17,380
appointed Scott Pruett in charge of the

1563
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:20,079
EPA well Scott Pruett is has nothing to

1564
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:22,479
do with the environment in fact his

1565
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,839
background is that he was a lawyer who

1566
01:07:22,479 --> 01:07:30,279
is suing the EPA prior prior to this on

1567
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:32,829
behalf of oil and gas companies so his

1568
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:34,749
big thing is he would like the EPA to go

1569
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:37,089
away he was suing kind of like to get

1570
01:07:34,749 --> 01:07:39,430
rid of these air pollution laws and now

1571
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:42,430
he's in charge of it right this is a

1572
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:45,069
classic political move if your political

1573
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:46,900
party doesn't like a certain agency you

1574
01:07:45,069 --> 01:07:48,339
take someone else that hates that agency

1575
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,140
and you put them in charge of it okay so

1576
01:07:48,339 --> 01:07:53,170
this is not new okay this kind of thing

1577
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:56,140
has been going on a long time but one of

1578
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:58,150
the things this brings up is well okay

1579
01:07:56,140 --> 01:08:02,319
so what's going to happen to all these

1580
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:04,839
air pollution laws right and the answer

1581
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:05,499
is we're not totally sure but about a

1582
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:07,989
year ago

1583
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:11,049
Trump signs an executive order to

1584
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:14,109
quote-unquote initiate a review of the

1585
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:15,609
air pollution policies and they have

1586
01:08:14,109 --> 01:08:17,380
been promising the Trump administration

1587
01:08:15,609 --> 01:08:19,000
in general has been promising that

1588
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,790
they're going to remove a lot of these

1589
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:25,150
air pollution regulations now as of

1590
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:26,679
right now nothing really concrete has

1591
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:30,159
been done they've rolled back a few

1592
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:32,170
things for coal-fired power plants but

1593
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:33,759
they really haven't completely got rid

1594
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:36,699
of the laws that we've been talking

1595
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,619
about for the Clean Air Act but or one

1596
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:40,359
year in so I have no idea what's gonna

1597
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:43,059
happen I don't want to dwell on this too

1598
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:45,159
much except to say times are changing

1599
01:08:43,059 --> 01:08:46,420
and it's a little ironic that I just

1600
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:49,270
showed you pictures of this from the

1601
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:53,079
1960s and now I can show you the same

1602
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:55,699
pictures of this from 2017 so people

1603
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:59,690
protesting about the exact same thing

1604
01:08:55,699 --> 01:09:02,239
forty years later well one of the things

1605
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:03,910
that came out of the Clean Air Act is

1606
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:08,049
something called the AQI

1607
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:10,850
and the AQI is the air quality index and

1608
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:14,569
what it does is it establishes a

1609
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:17,150
monitoring system for air and so we have

1610
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:19,029
a machine that collects air it measures

1611
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:23,540
the air pollution and then it rates it

1612
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:25,699
it's numerical from 0 to 500 and if

1613
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,989
you're in the 0 to 50 zone that's

1614
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:29,330
considered good that's where you want

1615
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:31,460
your air most of the time 50 to 100

1616
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:34,790
moderate and so on and so forth all the

1617
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:37,790
way to hazardous which is 300 to 500 and

1618
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:39,410
they assign a color to this as well well

1619
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:41,719
you can go online and you can check the

1620
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:43,160
air quality all across the country and

1621
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:46,029
here's this website right here we're

1622
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,029
going to go to this right now

1623
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:52,509
so here's what this website looks like

1624
01:09:49,549 --> 01:09:55,160
and we can visually just kind of look at

1625
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:57,739
the quality of the air so we see a lot

1626
01:09:55,160 --> 01:10:01,850
of green and yellow that's good news and

1627
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:04,520
you can zoom in and click on any station

1628
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:08,510
to get a reading so if I click on this

1629
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:11,960
one Santa Fe Airport okay so it's

1630
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:14,449
reporting 34 that's that's good right

1631
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,739
that's pretty clean air and by and large

1632
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:17,270
we're doing pretty well I don't know

1633
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:20,420
what's going on here we've got some near

1634
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:24,350
the border of 500 that's bad if we go

1635
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:27,410
down to Mexico looks like we've got some

1636
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:31,239
pretty polluted air down here by Mexico

1637
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:37,850
City that's not too surprising and let's

1638
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:40,250
go across the world here so over Europe

1639
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:43,370
here looks like we got a batch a pretty

1640
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:45,590
bad air right in there might be related

1641
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:52,330
to a temperature inversion I'm not

1642
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:57,110
really sure let's keep going no China

1643
01:10:52,330 --> 01:11:03,020
does not look good so we got a lot of

1644
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:05,420
red and we have a lot of dark red and in

1645
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,270
fact if you look at these if you can

1646
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,619
read it says 999 that means that

1647
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:11,929
pollution is so bad it's clear

1648
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:14,770
the scale so when they invented the AQI

1649
01:11:11,929 --> 01:11:17,150
scale I only went from 0 to 500 and

1650
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:19,699
there are air pollution monitors in

1651
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:24,080
China that routinely report air

1652
01:11:19,699 --> 01:11:25,840
pollution over a thousand in fact the

1653
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,489
government isn't completely forthcoming

1654
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,619
with how bad the air quality there is

1655
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:32,449
but we have an embassy in China and we

1656
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:34,790
have an air monitor on the roof and so

1657
01:11:32,449 --> 01:11:37,909
we we actually know how bad it is and

1658
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:39,409
it's routinely like 1,500 on the AQI

1659
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:42,500
scale something like that

1660
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:44,659
so in fact China is a pretty interesting

1661
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:49,159
study and what happens if you don't have

1662
01:11:44,659 --> 01:11:51,409
any air quality regulations so this is

1663
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:55,849
called a sunny day in China and this is

1664
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:57,650
not fog this is air pollution and this

1665
01:11:55,849 --> 01:12:01,070
is the kind of air when you have an AQI

1666
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:05,270
of 999 this is what it looks like okay

1667
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:07,790
and it comes in like a fog and it's

1668
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:11,420
often this way for weeks at a time in

1669
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:13,929
Beijing and people walk around with dust

1670
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:16,550
masks on

1671
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:18,800
sometimes people exercise out outside

1672
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:21,500
with with dust masks on other times a

1673
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,270
students exercise inside okay these guys

1674
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,889
going on the marathon with their

1675
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:26,630
respirators on these guys are pretty

1676
01:12:24,889 --> 01:12:30,380
gangster they don't care they're gonna

1677
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:32,960
breathe it in anyway this is what a

1678
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:34,940
satellite picture of China often looks

1679
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,849
like all this brown that you see that's

1680
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:39,710
all air pollution so it's worth pointing

1681
01:12:37,849 --> 01:12:41,480
out that the one of the reasons the air

1682
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:44,780
pollution is so bad in China is that

1683
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:49,040
unlike us they don't have or have not

1684
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:51,380
historically had any laws regarding air

1685
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,239
pollution they've also been growing

1686
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:55,610
they've been putting up like several

1687
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:58,699
coal fire power plants per week in the

1688
01:12:55,610 --> 01:13:00,770
last several years but unlike here where

1689
01:12:58,699 --> 01:13:02,869
we have a lot of fairly strict

1690
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:04,670
regulations regarding air pollution

1691
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:06,739
they've just pretty much let people do

1692
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:09,800
whatever they want and so you can kind

1693
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:12,920
of see the result of that system here in

1694
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,500
fact 2015 they were going to have a

1695
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:18,500
parade to celebrate the in a World War

1696
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,340
two so for a couple weeks leading up to

1697
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,679
the parade

1698
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,760
they took cars off the streets they shut

1699
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,700
down power

1700
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,530
plans to shut down factories and the day

1701
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:29,720
of the parade or the day before the

1702
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:31,130
parade I guess it is this is what it

1703
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,430
looked like this is what Beijing looked

1704
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:36,350
like you can actually see the sky

1705
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:38,030
literally the day after the parade they

1706
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:41,390
are all right back to work everybody

1707
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:44,270
this is what it looked like okay so they

1708
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:46,820
could have clean air it's it's possible

1709
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:49,820
but they're gonna have to invest you

1710
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:51,920
know time energy and political will to

1711
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:57,050
clean up their air to keep it you know

1712
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:59,900
kind of like what we have here so to

1713
01:13:57,050 --> 01:14:02,240
summarize the atmospheres have divided

1714
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,910
into layers with the lowest two layers

1715
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:07,460
being the troposphere and above that the

1716
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:09,140
stratosphere and the stratosphere has a

1717
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:12,440
big temperature inversion and that's

1718
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:14,330
what blocks convection now high pressure

1719
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:16,490
centers can create temperature

1720
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:19,130
inversions lower down in the troposphere

1721
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:21,920
and if you have one it will prevent

1722
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:23,930
things from convecting and going up into

1723
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,720
the atmosphere and that is what traps

1724
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:29,720
air pollution so we went through the

1725
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,180
different pollutants and we talked about

1726
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,910
how legally nothing really happened in

1727
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:36,800
this country till the 1970s and then we

1728
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:39,470
started passing laws regarding air

1729
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,550
pollution and the only things that are

1730
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:42,890
Putin are things that are actually

1731
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:45,050
dangerous to us so as we'll talk about

1732
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:46,790
in a future lecture greenhouse gases are

1733
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:52,850
not part of this list that's a separate

1734
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:55,910
thing and up until a year ago with a new

1735
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:58,190
administration the story has been that

1736
01:14:55,910 --> 01:15:00,590
each year that goes by air pollution

1737
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:02,750
here in this country gets better and

1738
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:04,310
better and the restrictions become

1739
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:06,140
tighter and tighter so your cars are

1740
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:08,870
cleaner your factories are cleaner etc

1741
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:14,440
right now who knows what's going to

1742
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:14,440
happen alright thanks for listening

1743
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:22,969
you
