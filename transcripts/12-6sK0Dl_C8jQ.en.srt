[Music]

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,540
hey this is Mel strong and this lecture

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,030
is on fronts and mid-latitude cyclones

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,369
now in previous lectures we've been

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,160
talking about how we can create clouds

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,109
and precipitation through convection so

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,390
in that story we've got a little parcel

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,420
of air it's warmer than its environment

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,240
and it wants to rise and as it rises it

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,969
expands and as it expands it cools and

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,950
eventually it will reach its dew point

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,630
and form a cloud if it keeps on going

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,540
then eventually you can get

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,610
precipitation ok there's a whole

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,559
completely different way to make clouds

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,899
and precipitation and it comes from the

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,289
collision of these large what we call

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,239
air masses so here's a map that you

19
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,090
often see in our textbook of air masses

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,399
and what they're trying to show here is

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,530
that air that sits over a particular

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,359
region will take on certain

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,059
characteristics and we talked about this

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,949
a little bit when we were back talking

25
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,049
about humidity that if you had a blob of

26
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,340
air sitting over the continent it's

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,320
probably very dry

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,869
whereas a blob of air that's sitting

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,710
over the ocean can pick up a lot of

30
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,869
water from evaporation well not only is

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,420
there that variable but it's also

32
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,659
depends on the temperature and where it

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,350
is so for example up here MP stands for

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,740
maritime polar this is maritime tropical

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,689
this is maritime equatorial so these are

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,020
all blobs of air that are sitting over

37
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,600
the ocean but as we learned when we in

38
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,310
the lecture on the evaporation if you're

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,869
sitting over warmer water there's a

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:48,360
higher evaporation rate into the air

41
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,680
mass so the air mass this air mass is

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,220
going to have a higher dew point than

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,409
say this air mass and we have for

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,540
example CPS continental polar CAS

45
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,750
continental Arctic we're not really

46
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,200
going to get into the the names too much

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,329
in this class but the point is is air

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,690
that's sitting over say this region

49
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,310
which is going to be cold and dry may

50
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,880
mingle with air that's sitting over this

51
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,740
region which is warmer

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,350
and more humid and when these two things

53
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,790
interact with each other you're going to

54
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,110
get some very interesting weather as a

55
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:25,360
result now it's a little misleading I

56
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,920
think this this diagram because a lot of

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,750
people might walk away thinking if there

58
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,090
is a blob of air sitting over here all

59
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,450
the time called Mt from air time

60
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,370
tropical but this is just represents

61
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,320
sort of average conditions and these air

62
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,390
masses are always moving around all the

63
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,910
time it's this is just trying to show

64
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,190
that air that sits over here typically

65
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,710
has certain characteristics that are

66
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,190
different than air that say sits over

67
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,690
here okay that's all that really means

68
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,830
so we're going to start today at Earth

69
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,410
will scold net and I'm going to change

70
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,850
the overlay to temperature and when I'm

71
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,610
looking at right now is surface

72
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,170
temperature and I'm doing this on a day

73
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,300
that's in the winter in the northern

74
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:13,420
hemisphere so what I see these this blue

75
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,240
and purple this is really cold air right

76
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,010
here and so we've got cold air that's

77
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,320
sitting over the continents looks like

78
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,320
right that's kind of what we would

79
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:28,420
expect we got cold air over Siberia and

80
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,880
Alaska and notice the pretty sharp

81
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,290
change in temperature the contrast in

82
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,320
temperature between the air over the

83
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,190
continent and the air over the ocean so

84
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,900
right now in Northern Hemisphere winter

85
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,480
the ocean is much warmer than the

86
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,250
continent okay now if we did this in the

87
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,200
summer we would see it's probably going

88
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,150
to need to be the opposite the continent

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,470
will be much warmer than the ocean and

90
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,690
the reason for this is that the ocean

91
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,300
has a very high what we call heat

92
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,250
capacity so what that means is it takes

93
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,140
a lot of energy to change the

94
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,700
temperature of the ocean so it takes a

95
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,410
long time for the ocean to warm up and

96
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,050
then once it's warm it takes a long time

97
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,700
for the ocean to cool down so the oceans

98
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,350
temperature is always out of sync with

99
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,459
the continents and that's what we're

100
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,290
seeing here okay so what I'm going to do

101
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,330
though is that so this is all surface

102
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,520
temperature and I'm interested in

103
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,090
showing you what the temperature is like

104
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,470
up in the upper parts of the atmosphere

105
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,840
so I'm going to click the word earth and

106
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,710
over here where it says height there are

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,819
these numbers

108
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,680
I need 5700 the units are HPA so that's

109
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,509
a unit of air pressure and we learned

110
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,069
this one back in the lecture on air

111
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:41,830
pressure I only change it to 700 HPA so

112
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,900
what that means is if you end up in the

113
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,729
in the atmosphere and a balloon till you

114
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,229
reached a level where the air pressure

115
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,240
was 700 millibars

116
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:52,690
what would the temperature up there be

117
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,910
like now how high is that give or take

118
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,410
about about ten thousand feet above the

119
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,320
ground just kind of think of that right

120
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,270
so we're just kind of looking at what

121
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,669
the temperature is like 10,000 feet

122
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,770
above the ground or so and you'll notice

123
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,990
how different the pattern looks compared

124
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,210
to what we just saw for one thing we

125
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,169
don't see the big contrast between the

126
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,330
oceans and the continents anymore and we

127
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:18,610
see that for the most part if i zoom out

128
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,340
a little bit if why I kind of look

129
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,400
around the middle of the earth I see

130
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,849
that the temperatures around here don't

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,770
change that much and then when you get

132
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:34,810
further to the north of the South you

133
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:37,060
suddenly hit this much colder blob of

134
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,190
air up there and it's a pretty sharp

135
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,470
contrast so in other words it should not

136
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,690
be surprising that the equator is hot

137
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,240
and the poles are cold but what you

138
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,909
might expect to see is that from the

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,250
hottest point on earth it gradually gets

140
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:53,469
colder as you move to the north or gets

141
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,639
colder with gradually gets colder as you

142
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:58,210
move to the south but what does this

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,370
showing us is actually this very little

144
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,320
change in temperature again remember

145
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,120
we're at least 10,000 feet above the

146
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,860
ground here or looking at this so

147
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,759
there's very little change in

148
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,669
temperature and then all of a sudden we

149
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,289
hit this boundary as pretty sharp where

150
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:17,190
we go from the warm air to the cold air

151
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:19,800
very abruptly so there's not a gradation

152
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,330
okay so that's the first observation

153
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,780
second observation is the boundary

154
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,639
between the cold air and the warm air is

155
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,979
curvy right so if I look at the North

156
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,979
Pole I can see it's got these waves in

157
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,539
it and I'm gonna turn around and look at

158
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,460
the South Pole because there's another

159
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,730
one down there it's a little bit easier

160
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,940
to see this time of year

161
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,680
okay so this boundary between the warm

162
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,800
air and the cold air it's called the

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,680
polar front okay it's always there it's

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,620
always there in summer in the winter but

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,450
right now it's there summer down in the

166
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,230
southern hemisphere so their pool of

167
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,820
cold air is smaller and it's winter up

168
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,330
here in the northern hemisphere so our

169
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,950
pool of cool there is is larger and if

170
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,290
we did this in the summer those two

171
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,960
things would be reversed

172
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,190
so what I'm gonna do here is let me go

173
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,200
back to the southern hemisphere because

174
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,870
it's easier to see okay so I'm gonna go

175
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,610
forward in time a little bit here so day

176
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:22,140
later one day later one day later one

177
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,040
day later each one of these is one day

178
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:28,410
later and you'll notice that this cult

179
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,260
this blob of cold air is slowly rotating

180
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,140
around the earth so every 24 hours

181
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,760
it's changing its shape and there are

182
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,650
these you know there's parts that kind

183
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,870
of break off a little bit and overall

184
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,990
it's still kind of you know keeps this

185
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,990
it's staying in the same area but the

186
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,290
actual outline of it is changing slowly

187
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,780
day to day okay and these waves that we

188
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,740
see that are in this blob of cold air

189
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,760
are called Roz B waves so you can see

190
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,620
especially in the northern hemisphere

191
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,150
here I've got these waves okay and let

192
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,030
me go back in time a couple of days if I

193
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,260
go back in time a day a day you can see

194
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,820
these waves are changing their shape

195
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:19,200
okay so the point is we've got this blob

196
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:22,290
of cold air that is slowly moving around

197
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,240
the poles of the planet and so the the

198
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,390
planets rotating 24 hours a day but and

199
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,550
this blob of cold air takes you know ten

200
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:33,300
or so days to make a full revolution all

201
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:36,780
the way around the earth now right here

202
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:40,290
at this boundary between the the warm

203
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,330
air and the cold air this is where we're

204
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:45,900
mixing up two completely different kinds

205
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,960
of air masses this is cold dry air this

206
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,050
is warmer more humid air and that

207
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,120
boundary is is what we're talking about

208
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,240
today that front where we're calling the

209
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,800
polar front where these two air masses

210
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,940
meet we're going to get some interesting

211
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:09,930
types of weather now if I find a zone

212
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:15,810
here okay so now I've changed it back to

213
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:18,540
today with winds and I'm looking at out

214
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:23,220
here in the Pacific and I notice for

215
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,980
example this spot right here so the

216
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,660
winds are spinning counterclockwise

217
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,149
right here or in the northern hemisphere

218
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,550
so that tells you that I must have a

219
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:35,190
center of low pressure right there okay

220
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,930
now if I'm gonna zoom out a little bit

221
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,180
here you can kind of make out the fact

222
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,730
that we're taking air that's from the

223
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,370
north and it's cold and it's coming down

224
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,620
and then we're taking air that's warmer

225
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,600
and more humid from the south and it's

226
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,360
coming up and these two things are

227
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,240
mixing up together in this big spiral

228
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,579
pattern okay this is what we mean when

229
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,470
we talk about air masses colliding we

230
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:00,870
have two very different air masses and

231
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,270
this low-pressure center is mixing them

232
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,790
up with them up together now I'm going

233
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,950
to change this instead of temperature

234
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,620
I'm going to change it to look at

235
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,870
moisture so tpw means total precipitable

236
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,240
water and this just looks at all the

237
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,410
water that's in the atmosphere now it's

238
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,770
a little bit more evident that we're

239
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,720
mixing up different types of air so very

240
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,120
cold very dry air coming off the

241
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,100
continent warmer more humid air coming

242
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,220
from the south and we're mixing these

243
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,990
two things together I can turn off the

244
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,750
wind here a little bit so you can see

245
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,279
that right there we're mixing it up we

246
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,860
get a little Center little pressure

247
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,720
right there here's another one or mixing

248
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,029
up again warm humid air with cold dry

249
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,279
air and this is what happens along the

250
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:47,339
polar front we're mixing up two very

251
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,920
different air masses and right through

252
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,300
here we've got the invasion if you kind

253
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,640
of imagine what's happening here I've

254
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,310
got cold air coming down invading the

255
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,589
warm air and then I've got the warm air

256
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:02,279
coming up and invading the cold air

257
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:04,920
right and so these two things are two

258
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,290
different kinds of fronts overall the

259
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,570
pole

260
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,759
front is the name we gave to those that

261
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:13,089
wavy blob but we can break it down

262
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,790
further because here we got cold dry air

263
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:18,820
invading warm human air and then up here

264
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,350
we've got warm humid air invading cold

265
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,649
dry air so we turn the winds back on

266
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,389
here so here's you here's where the cold

267
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,300
dry air is invading the warm where they

268
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:31,420
meet and then this is where that warm

269
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,310
humid air meets the cold dry air ok so

270
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,910
these are going to form two different

271
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,610
kinds of fronts so we're going to be

272
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,560
looking at what happens where these two

273
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,899
different types of air invade each other

274
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,610
so the first one we're going to look at

275
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:49,420
is what happens where the warm air

276
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,100
invades the cold air so if that happens

277
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,730
and we let's say we make a cross-section

278
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:58,209
of the atmosphere so we're looking at it

279
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,459
from the side we would expect that the

280
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:03,250
warm air will be coming somewhere from

281
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:07,680
the south in our part of the world so

282
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:10,720
over here is the warm air and it's

283
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:15,069
headed towards the north it's invading

284
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:21,220
okay and to the north we have the cold

285
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:23,440
air that's sitting there so when we

286
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,690
talked about convection what we said was

287
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
if I have a parcel of warm air it will

288
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,980
rise because it's warmer than the air

289
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,550
around it which is due to density

290
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:36,040
differences now here what we're doing is

291
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:40,300
we're forcing warm air to collide with

292
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,029
the cold air but they still have that

293
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,010
same density difference the cold air is

294
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,470
more dense the warm air is less dense so

295
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,720
what happens is if I try to shove warm

296
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,139
air in the cold air it's going to want

297
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:58,110
to right up over the cold air and so

298
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:58,110
that's what happens but it kind of forms

299
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,340
this very low angle ramp so when the

300
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:08,790
warm air encounters the cold air so so

301
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:11,540
just to be clear this is cold air down

302
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:20,339
here in this wedge the warm air then

303
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:22,800
rises up this ramp it's a very low angle

304
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,050
ramp maybe just a degree or two and it

305
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,690
goes on for perhaps hundreds of miles

306
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:33,320
okay this is a very large feature well

307
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:37,320
this air as it goes up the ramp is

308
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,480
rising and anytime you make air rise it

309
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,040
expands and expanding air cools and

310
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,200
eventually you'll hit the dew point and

311
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,790
then you get a cloud so that's what's

312
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,620
going to happen to this Baba warm air

313
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,210
that's down here it's going to go up

314
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,620
this ramp and as it goes up the ramp

315
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:55,080
it's going to cool more and more so all

316
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,360
the way out here at the edge the top of

317
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:04,770
the ramp we would have some very high

318
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:10,040
wispy clouds which we know are Cirrus

319
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:14,790
and then they get a little bit thicker

320
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:22,290
and more of a blanket and that's what we

321
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:29,480
would call zero Stratus and then they

322
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:36,839
get thicker still and that we would call

323
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:38,640
altostratus right and then further back

324
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,839
on this wedge we're getting a thicker

325
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:46,200
and thicker chunk of air and eventually

326
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,420
they would be so thick that we would not

327
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,490
be able to see the cloud sorry wouldn't

328
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,520
be able to see the Sun that's Stratus

329
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:56,370
and then from behind that point if it's

330
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,510
a well developed this whole thing is

331
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:02,940
pretty well developed we would have

332
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:08,270
precipitation coming out of this and at

333
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,270
that point we've got nimbostratus

334
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,560
okay now this whole thing not only is

335
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:20,220
the warm air writing up over the cold

336
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,930
air but the actual wedge itself is also

337
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,060
moving so this everything on this

338
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,470
picture the way I've drawn it is moving

339
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:30,389
to our right here

340
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:33,629
okay well this spot right here where the

341
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:38,939
warm air meets the cold air that is

342
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:41,670
called a warm front okay

343
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:47,910
and it's a call to warm front because

344
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:50,790
let's say you're right here and you are

345
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,420
gonna experience this whole thing when

346
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:57,180
this ramp gets to you and passes over

347
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,269
you the experience is that the

348
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,769
temperatures increase because this air

349
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:04,769
back here is warmer than the air that

350
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:06,779
you're currently sitting in so in a warm

351
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:10,470
front the temperatures will increase as

352
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:12,750
it goes by all right so let's think

353
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:18,000
about the series of events that would

354
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:20,699
happen here if you're out here and this

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,639
warm front is approaching you now to get

356
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:26,430
from from this point to this point might

357
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,069
take you know 24 hours could be more

358
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,779
could be less well let's just say that

359
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:35,040
you're let's just say this this whole

360
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:39,120
thing takes let's say day and a half

361
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,910
okay so you're standing out here and

362
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,470
this warm front approaches

363
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,930
it's the 1800s and you don't have any

364
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,160
electricity there's no weather stations

365
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:51,420
nothing like that and you're on your

366
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:54,980
horse and you look up and you see wispy

367
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:58,699
clouds in the sky okay and then maybe

368
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,110
four to six hours later you see

369
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:01,529
cirrostratus remember what that looks

370
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,899
like

371
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:05,280
it's ringing around the Sun okay so you

372
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,280
went from wispy clouds to ring around

373
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:12,409
the Sun and then if it's still daylight

374
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:16,470
fuzzy Sun and then later

375
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:20,280
no Sun okay so if you notice that

376
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,459
pattern cirrus to cirrostratus to also

377
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,560
stress to Stratus

378
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:30,410
there's a good chance that it is going

379
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:33,140
to rain in the next say 24 hours so

380
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,700
people started to notice this pattern

381
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,650
they started to notice that if he saw

382
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,770
this and he saw this and you saw this it

383
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,530
leads to rain so there is some folklore

384
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,030
in certain parts of the world that say

385
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,330
that if you see a ring around the Sun

386
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,990
it's going to rain this is where it

387
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,640
comes from

388
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:56,550
that is true for a warm front okay now

389
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,200
as we'll talk about in a little bit warm

390
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,680
fronts don't occur everywhere in the

391
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,720
world they occur along that polar front

392
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,120
that zone between the warm air and the

393
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,880
cold air the thing with the rose be

394
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,120
waves if you live in that area

395
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,820
that's true ring around the Sun often

396
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,380
does mean it's going to rain but you can

397
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,240
get a ring around the Sun in a lot of

398
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,430
different places in the world and not

399
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,220
have a warm front so that doesn't

400
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,670
totally hold true ok but that's where it

401
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,750
comes from

402
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:30,720
ok so this whole thing again in this

403
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,340
scenario is moving past you maybe it

404
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,680
takes a day and a half or so to get from

405
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,870
this point to this point so your

406
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,250
experience would be Sara Sara Stratus

407
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,410
all the stress Stratus and then rain

408
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,520
maybe as much as 24 hours

409
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:47,190
okay now that spot right there is the

410
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:54,270
warm front that that spot we can put

411
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:58,200
that spot on a map so the show a warm

412
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:04,460
front on a map will have a line with

413
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,460
these humps ok so this is a warm front

414
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:18,620
and the warm air is back here and the

415
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:21,180
cold air is on the other side okay so

416
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,910
the warm air is behind the humps and

417
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:27,300
it's moving in the direction of the

418
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,160
humps okay so this is the the the

419
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,260
literal point on the ground that we had

420
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,920
where the wedge meet the surface in that

421
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,320
previous diagram okay so the warm air is

422
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,200
coming along it hits this cold air and

423
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:45,620
it ramps up over it so what that means

424
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:51,090
is that right ahead of let's see right

425
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:55,050
here somewhere ahead of this would be

426
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,780
our cirrus clouds and then behind that

427
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:02,280
they get thicker and we get the

428
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:04,350
cirrostratus right and then the uncle

429
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,120
Stratos and all that but it's a big band

430
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:10,770
it's a big band ahead of this warm front

431
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,480
so eventually if you're looking at this

432
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,520
from space and we'll see one in a second

433
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,220
you'll see the Cirrus as kind of a fuzzy

434
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,110
edge and then it gets solid white up

435
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,420
until you get to where the warm front

436
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,580
passes now a couple other things

437
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,830
think about dew point for for a minute

438
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,570
the warm air and cold air the warm air

439
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,930
has come from the south it probably came

440
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:38,370
from an ocean so the dew points are

441
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:45,300
probably higher and the cold air as we

442
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:47,460
know the dew points are lower so as this

443
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,500
warm front passes over you you know if

444
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,480
you're if you're out here and you're

445
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,850
seeing that sequence of clouds as this

446
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,800
thing is approaching you the other thing

447
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,920
that changes is when this passes over

448
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:03,270
you your temperatures go up and your dew

449
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:06,210
points will also go up okay so that is a

450
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:10,320
warm front so now let's imagine what

451
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:12,800
happens where the cold air invades the

452
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,800
warm air

453
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:18,779
okay same kind of scenario except now

454
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:22,859
what's going to happen is we've got warm

455
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:26,519
air over here and we've got cold air

456
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:29,669
over here but the cold air is now

457
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:32,099
invading the warm air okay so it's

458
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:35,309
coming in colliding with the warm there

459
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:38,489
now the cold air is more dense and it

460
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:43,349
tends to kind of hug the ground so kind

461
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:45,359
of like this so it's it's got like

462
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:48,059
basically tunnel underneath that warm

463
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,960
air and it's gonna throw the warm air up

464
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:54,379
out of the way

465
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,239
so you got cold air coming down

466
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:59,519
tunneling underneath the warm air

467
00:21:56,239 --> 00:22:01,739
shoving it up out of the way and one of

468
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,649
the things that you're gonna get right

469
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:10,769
here right where that cold air meets the

470
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:16,019
warm air is very likely cumulonimbus are

471
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:20,849
at least cumuliform clouds so I'll draw

472
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:23,070
some cumulonimbus here so this rolls

473
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:25,529
through shoves warm air up out of the

474
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,629
way the warm air rises in these little

475
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:30,299
pockets and gives you a cumulonimbus and

476
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:33,419
then what happens is as this thing

477
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:36,090
passes you know this is pretty cold air

478
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,700
and the ground was kind of warm that it

479
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,979
rolled over you've got will opens a warm

480
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,659
air rising up through the cold air and

481
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:47,140
you will get all kinds of cumulonimbus

482
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:48,480
forming

483
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,480
[Music]

484
00:22:48,480 --> 00:23:00,510
in the back as this cold air rolls

485
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:08,650
through so this point right here that is

486
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:11,650
the cold front and if you were here and

487
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,590
a cold front is coming towards you your

488
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:18,610
experience is that you don't really

489
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:21,280
experience until the front hits you and

490
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,740
when the front hits you boom you have

491
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,780
cumuliform clouds so it could be keenly

492
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,970
less could be towering cumulus could be

493
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,490
cumulonimbus it could be it could be a

494
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:34,090
line of very severe thunderstorms if you

495
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:37,690
live in certain areas and then as this

496
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:40,750
cold front passes over you this blob of

497
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:42,820
cold air moves past you your temperature

498
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,240
suddenly drops okay so that's what we

499
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,549
call it a cold front and just to remind

500
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,510
you of what we said last time so we've

501
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:54,809
got low dew points here so cold air is

502
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:57,610
always dry air as this rolls past you

503
00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:00,490
not only does your temperature drop that

504
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,980
very likely the dew point also drops so

505
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,850
this is so in a warm front then we've

506
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:11,559
get the stratiform clouds in a cold

507
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:14,070
front we get more cumuliform clouds so

508
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,070
on a map

509
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,590
the cold front if it's in color is in

510
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:24,950
blue but either way you're looking for a

511
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:29,300
line with triangular teeth and the

512
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:32,210
triangular teeth indicate a cold front

513
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:36,500
air behind the triangular teeth is where

514
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:41,060
the cold air is and on the other side is

515
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:44,180
the warm air and the cold air is moving

516
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:48,080
in the direction that the teeth are

517
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,670
pointing okay so that's a cold front and

518
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,980
if you can't remember which is which and

519
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,660
if it's black and white would I tilt

520
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,930
when I teaches the kids I tell them that

521
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,180
the cold air is biting cold that's why

522
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:02,000
the cold front has teeth they helped you

523
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,510
remember great there is another type of

524
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,520
front where the two air masses actually

525
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,490
come up against each other but neither

526
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,430
one wins it's called a stationary front

527
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:18,110
I'm going to draw that real quick so in

528
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:26,720
a stationary front you've got teeth on

529
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:33,200
one side and then you've got humps on

530
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:37,310
the other side okay so the same rules

531
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:44,870
apply the warmer is behind the humps and

532
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:46,700
the cold air is behind the teeth and at

533
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,230
least at this point in time neither one

534
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:56,570
is really taking over the other

535
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:58,700
that's called a stationary front so warm

536
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,910
fronts and cold fronts usually occur

537
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,340
together near the same place along the

538
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:07,610
polar front and we call it at a

539
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,040
mid-latitude cyclone so by mid-latitude

540
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,320
cycle and what we mean is not low

541
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,480
latitudes like the equator and not

542
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,730
really high latitudes like the poles but

543
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,040
somewhere in the middle and cyclone is

544
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,770
another word for storm so you can think

545
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,110
of this as a storm that occurs in the

546
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,060
mid-latitudes kind of along the polar

547
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,510
front

548
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:30,670
so we're gonna go through the stages of

549
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,730
how one of these form and how they

550
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:37,960
evolve and then eventually die so it

551
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:42,460
starts out with essentially a stationary

552
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:49,390
front along the polar front so what we

553
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:53,130
have is we've got cold air to the north

554
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:58,260
so we're you know drawing this from a

555
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:00,850
Northern Hemisphere perspective right so

556
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,940
if this is in the southern hemisphere

557
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,790
everything would be flipped so we've got

558
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,200
the cold air up here we've got the warm

559
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:12,910
air down here and right now neither one

560
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,940
is invading the other so we have a

561
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:20,170
stationary front but it won't stay that

562
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:24,940
way for long because you've the cold air

563
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:28,020
side usually has air or winds that are

564
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,240
coming down from the east and the warm

565
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,710
typically kind of has westerlies so

566
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,260
you've got the situation where you have

567
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,140
two different kinds of air masses which

568
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,730
have different densities going past each

569
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,710
other in different directions and that's

570
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,570
not a very stable setup and what's going

571
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,780
to happen is that there will be waves

572
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:49,810
that develop in this boundary and once

573
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:53,320
we start to develop a wave we start to

574
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:57,280
make a meal add to it cyclone so we'll

575
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:02,340
make a slight wave in that in that front

576
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:12,700
and we're gonna we're going to form a

577
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:16,120
mid-latitude cycle okay so we start to

578
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:22,090
develop a cold front on the west side of

579
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:29,520
it and a warm front on the east side of

580
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:29,520
it and so now we've got kind of this

581
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:35,980
and draw these guys in here we've got a

582
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:39,040
counterclockwise rotation that's

583
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,130
starting to set up here and in the

584
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,880
center of a counterclockwise rotation in

585
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,810
the northern hemisphere is a low so I'm

586
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,150
gonna draw it there's a center of

587
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:52,690
low-pressure kind of right between those

588
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:55,000
two fronts now why is the pressure low

589
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,030
because air is rising why is there

590
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,770
rising well and this one you've got

591
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,470
remember the ramp so you've got warm

592
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,960
they're ramping up rising up over the

593
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,610
cool air in front of it here you've got

594
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,410
cold air tunneling underneath the warm

595
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:12,160
air and pushing it up out of the way

596
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:14,890
in both cases air is rising so this

597
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,350
whole thing air is rising but the this

598
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:20,440
center of low pressure is right in

599
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:24,720
between it those two types of fronts all

600
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,720
right so now what's going to happen is

601
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:36,460
the storm intensifies and this

602
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:39,430
counterclockwise motion is going to

603
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,880
continue so you're going to get

604
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:45,930
something that kind of has this shape so

605
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:49,060
the cold front is sweeping around and

606
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:55,150
then the warm front it's kind of arching

607
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:57,670
up now think of everything we said

608
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,530
earlier about a warm front in a cold

609
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:04,630
front like all the clouds and all that

610
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:06,310
stuff that's happening all the warm

611
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,470
front stuff is happening over here all

612
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:12,010
the cold front stuff is happening over

613
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:15,160
here now in our part of the world when

614
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,850
one of these forms this whole thing is

615
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,920
also moving to the east so you have to

616
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,630
imagine as we're drawing this that

617
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,290
there's two things happening one is

618
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,910
you've got counterclockwise rotation so

619
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:31,270
the Front's themselves are starting to

620
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:33,040
twist around the center of this and the

621
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,010
other thing that's happening is this

622
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,690
whole business is moving as its twisting

623
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:41,159
okay so that's the motion of a

624
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:47,460
mid-latitude cyclone so

625
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:50,460
as the storm intensifies what happens is

626
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:56,580
the cold front moves faster than the

627
00:30:50,460 --> 00:31:01,559
warm front and it catches up to it so it

628
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:12,059
looks something like this and this is a

629
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:15,450
cold front and this is a warm front so

630
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:19,049
now this this cold front has wrapped all

631
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:21,409
the way around and it's caught up to the

632
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:24,499
warm front and it tunnels underneath the

633
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:31,229
warm front and so that gets a special

634
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:37,139
name we put a hump and a tooth on each

635
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:47,099
side and that is called an occluded

636
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:49,080
front ok so again that cold air when

637
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:51,690
it's wrapping around is moving faster

638
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,269
than the warm air perhaps around catches

639
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,799
up to it tunnels underneath now we got

640
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:57,899
three different fronts here the warm

641
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,519
front the cold front and this occluded

642
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,539
front which is really two fronts on top

643
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:08,369
of each other now at this point the

644
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:16,499
storm is at its peak energy okay so the

645
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:20,519
storm is the strongest but once the

646
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:22,639
front starts to occlude then it's kind

647
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:26,460
of like this whole thing's zips up and

648
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,679
as a zips up it shuts itself off so when

649
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,139
the occlusion happens the storm is the

650
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:37,259
strongest we would say it's in its

651
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:42,509
mature state and the end is near okay so

652
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:45,450
also end is near once this happens then

653
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:51,330
it the end is within you know probably a

654
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:54,000
day or two so the steps from initiation

655
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,270
to here

656
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,910
depends on lots of factors but roughly

657
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,800
one of these things lasts five days

658
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,110
seven days something like that

659
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,350
so it'll form it'll go through these

660
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:10,380
stages then these these two fronts kind

661
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:13,290
of zip together and it shuts itself off

662
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,880
and then another one forms okay that's

663
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:19,890
the life of a mid-latitude cycle now

664
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,220
what we're going to do is talk about

665
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:28,940
what it would be like to live through a

666
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:31,860
mid-latitude cyclone so let's put put a

667
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,910
fairly mature mid-latitude cycle in here

668
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:47,030
let's do it this way okay so there's my

669
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:58,070
warm front and here's my cold front oops

670
00:33:47,030 --> 00:34:03,330
changed my color okay now you live here

671
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:06,810
and we're gonna talk about what it would

672
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:11,940
be like if one of these formed and then

673
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:14,220
moved past you over you now as is this

674
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,550
happening this thing is rotating

675
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,110
counterclockwise this front is going to

676
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,810
catch up to that front and this whole

677
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,399
thing is on the move but for to simplify

678
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,710
things let's just assume that the front

679
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:28,159
state just like they are but this whole

680
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,810
thing is going to move as is across and

681
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,370
pass over you okay we're going to talk

682
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:36,770
about what you would see what you would

683
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:40,409
notice now as the storm approaches

684
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:42,409
realize that we're gonna see events that

685
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:46,169
are from the warm front first then

686
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:48,780
there's a gap and then events from the

687
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:50,940
cold front next so that's one thing to

688
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,240
keep in mind the other thing to keep in

689
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,720
mind is that this El the center of low

690
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,570
pressure as it moves towards us the

691
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,090
distance between us and the El is

692
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,710
decreasing so what does that mean that

693
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,740
means the air pressure that we

694
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:10,619
experience as this gets closer to us

695
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:13,530
is going down and then at some point

696
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:16,860
that L will pass by and then as it moves

697
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,480
on we will get farther from the L and

698
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,830
our pressure will go back up

699
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,740
okay so there's going to be a change in

700
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,330
pressure in addition to all the changes

701
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,470
in clouds and everything else here so

702
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:31,619
we're going to kind of write down the

703
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:34,590
list of events so 1800s you're out on a

704
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,150
horse you're out here you have no idea

705
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:39,180
what's going on in terms of the weather

706
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,740
but this thing is approaching you and so

707
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,880
we're gonna think of terms of like what

708
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:47,750
that person would see okay so first

709
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,130
thing what are they gonna notice well

710
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,450
ahead what's ahead of the warm front the

711
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,450
first thing that happens ahead of the

712
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:58,410
warm front are the cirrus clouds right

713
00:35:54,450 --> 00:36:05,430
so you see the cirrus clouds and then

714
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:12,720
that transitions to your cirrostratus in

715
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:14,850
your Aldo Stratus then your Stratus okay

716
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,580
so we're gonna assume that this is kind

717
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,770
of like a pretty big pretty big storm

718
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,830
okay so I'm gonna sign some kind of

719
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:25,109
arbitrary x to this but let's just say

720
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:30,300
that this right here is about twelve

721
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:33,270
hours okay so as you're watching this

722
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,520
this whole thing is on the march towards

723
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:38,430
you right

724
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:42,090
so then what finally gets to you what

725
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:48,619
comes after Stratus Nimmo Stratus okay

726
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:50,609
so that gets to you next and you're in

727
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:52,890
precipitation now what kind of

728
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:56,220
precipitation is it it's kind of us it's

729
00:36:52,890 --> 00:37:00,840
like a slow and steady rain so I'm going

730
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:05,240
right down steady precip no rain or snow

731
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:08,760
could be either how long does it rain so

732
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,080
if you're from New Mexico you might want

733
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,100
to sit down for this because it's gonna

734
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:17,310
be hard to wrap your mind around you can

735
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,950
get 24 hours or more of steady

736
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,119
precipitation okay I know that freaks

737
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,369
people out

738
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,499
but let's just say that in this scenario

739
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:28,769
this person is going to get about 24

740
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:30,480
hours of constant steady rain it's not a

741
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:32,039
downpour usually it's not like a

742
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,440
thunderstorm we're just Marines really

743
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:37,769
hard it's a more of a state slow and

744
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,170
steady type of precipitation okay

745
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:44,849
so if you imagine if you can visualize

746
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:47,339
this whole thing traveling okay after 24

747
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:50,069
hours of precipitation that warm front

748
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:53,789
is now right up to where you are okay

749
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:55,380
but as this has happened there's another

750
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:57,329
thing that to keep in mind it's also

751
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,180
been happening ever since step number

752
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:02,789
one which is this low-pressure center

753
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,039
has been getting closer to you so the

754
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:09,779
air pressure that you experience down

755
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:12,089
here on the ground is decreasing so

756
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:13,619
during this whole stage I'm going to put

757
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:18,450
number three but it's happened since the

758
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:26,730
very beginning is the air pressure from

759
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:30,390
your perspective oops is decreasing so

760
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:33,390
in old school barometer talk that means

761
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,309
that that mercury column is going down

762
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:38,450
so if our farmer in the 1800 has one of

763
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:45,329
those what they would say is that the

764
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:48,619
the barometer is falling okay that

765
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:53,400
refers to that dropping calm and mercury

766
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:55,400
all right so we're down we're now off to

767
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,049
a day and a half right 12 hours of

768
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,390
changing clouds 24 hours of

769
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:01,529
precipitation that whole time the air

770
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,960
pressure has been decreasing the

771
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:07,019
barometers been dropping but now this

772
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,539
front is right to your doorstep so what

773
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:11,489
happens well the warm front passes so

774
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:17,549
what's that like temperatures are going

775
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:20,039
to go up so if you think back to the

776
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:22,200
ramp the bottom of the ramp now is is

777
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,410
passing over us and we're in the warmer

778
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:30,980
pool of air behind it so our dew points

779
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:36,450
are going to be up to okay

780
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:41,990
now from your perspective it seems like

781
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,990
the storm might be over so the storm

782
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:52,380
will say it starts to break up okay so

783
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,600
you've been in slow steady rain for 24

784
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,550
hours and now it's you know it's kind of

785
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,190
stopping and you got some cracks between

786
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:01,590
the clouds and you're in this warm

787
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,690
rather humid air okay so now you have to

788
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:06,480
imagine that this thing has gotten to

789
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,850
you and it's past you so that now you're

790
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,550
in in this part okay you're in this part

791
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:15,240
of the storm and you've got to gap

792
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:18,090
between when the warm front passes you

793
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,690
and the cold front arrives in this

794
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:25,560
sector and so in this sector is probably

795
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:28,080
very little precipitation and might see

796
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,110
some Sun right might be you know some

797
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,200
strategy mule asur or maybe might almost

798
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:39,480
be completely clear at some point so I'm

799
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:41,400
gonna continue my steps over here so and

800
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,070
again we're kind of assuming this is a

801
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:52,020
pretty big slow-moving storm so we'll

802
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:55,740
say half day to 24 hours of a break okay

803
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,130
looks like storms over then coming

804
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:01,320
behind all that is the cold front okay

805
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,380
now the other thing that's happening too

806
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:07,770
is this low that's been moving is now

807
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:10,610
passed over you and so pretty soon your

808
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:19,560
barometer is gonna start to rise again

809
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:21,450
so the barometer starts to rise so again

810
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,960
that mercury column starts going up

811
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:31,500
right so in other words air pressure

812
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:35,040
increases then cold front arrives what's

813
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,500
that like well immediate thing that

814
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,080
happens temperatures drop and we said

815
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,050
that along the boundary here of this

816
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,599
cold front that you often get pretty

817
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,940
severe cumulonimbus

818
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,579
so if I can imagine let's say I'm

819
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,930
looking at this on a satellite loop and

820
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:54,140
we'll see this in a second but right

821
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:59,359
behind this cold front I'd have a bunch

822
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:01,480
of cumulonimbus and as time goes on they

823
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,930
kind of become less and less frequent

824
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,930
usually so what's your experience about

825
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:12,559
it your experience of that is not a slow

826
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:15,170
steady rain but it's raining here and

827
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:18,049
not here it's raining here and not here

828
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:20,299
it's raining here and not here what do

829
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:23,539
we call that and weather speak scattered

830
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:27,049
showers or if it's snowing snow flurries

831
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:35,740
okay either one so when that cold front

832
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:42,289
arrives we're gonna get cumulonimbus so

833
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:51,400
we'll call that scattered showers right

834
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:51,400
and if it's cold enough snow flurries

835
00:42:54,339 --> 00:43:02,690
okay so that goes by and now again

836
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,910
visualize that this whole thing is moved

837
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,519
past you and you're now back here in

838
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:15,529
this sector of the storm well if it's a

839
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:26,150
big one you might get 24 hours or more

840
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:29,869
of this kind of cold and stable air so

841
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:31,700
the scattered showers can continue a day

842
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,349
and then the next day they're even fewer

843
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,609
and the next day they're even fewer it

844
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:40,099
could be something like that if it's a

845
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:42,200
big storm okay so what happened so if

846
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:46,069
you can't keep track here we had a half

847
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,349
day of clouds a day of rain maybe up to

848
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:51,619
a day of a break and then we get a

849
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:55,190
couple days of this cold and stable air

850
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:57,609
with scattered showers okay and then

851
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,440
this whole thing now

852
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:01,630
is completely buying you're back here

853
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,970
somewhere and what's back here well

854
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:08,170
what's back there is some really cold

855
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:12,700
air that's coming down from the north

856
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:23,230
from Canada let's say and this is very

857
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:25,749
cold and very stable very cold very dry

858
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:31,509
very stable so what kind of weather is

859
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:38,519
that clear skies sunny but cold so kind

860
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:47,579
of our last step here number ten is cold

861
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:47,579
sunny and normally several days of this

862
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:57,309
okay okay that is sort of the experience

863
00:44:55,329 --> 00:45:00,720
of someone on the ground who is

864
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:03,789
experiencing a mid-latitude cyclone now

865
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:08,819
if everybody in this class was from New

866
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:12,069
England or from Minnesota or from Norway

867
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:14,220
everybody would understand this because

868
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:17,680
you had experienced that many many times

869
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:21,130
the further south you go the further

870
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:25,630
away you get to the polar front so what

871
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:28,450
happens as say in New Mexico we rarely

872
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:31,150
get all of these steps in fact this is

873
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,489
called the Norwegian model the Norwegian

874
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:35,140
model was formed by these guys in Norway

875
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:37,299
who made a bunch of observations of

876
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:40,029
these mid latitude cyclones and notice

877
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:42,869
they formed a pattern what actually

878
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:47,190
happens where we live most of the time

879
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:47,190
and you kind of have to think of

880
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:57,780
okay let's say this is the earth and

881
00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:00,510
there's a polar front okay

882
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,300
so we're gonna mix up air on the polar

883
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:05,550
front and you're gonna get a cold front

884
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,660
and a warm front so maybe at some

885
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:12,599
particular time here's the warm front

886
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:16,830
here's a cold front right something like

887
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:18,840
this and this thing is moving or you

888
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,609
know following basically the polar front

889
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,869
and twisting and all that but here's the

890
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:28,440
thing where's New Mexico in this picture

891
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:30,450
New Mexico might be like right there so

892
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,330
what does that mean that means that we

893
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:36,660
missed the warm front entirely and we

894
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:39,510
get the tail end of the cold front so if

895
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,369
you lived in New Mexico a long time you

896
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,710
know what this means because it in the

897
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:46,290
winter what do we get cold air and wind

898
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:49,920
and that's pretty much all we get right

899
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:52,590
our winters are pretty dry whereas if we

900
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,359
lived further up here in that same storm

901
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,520
system they might get you know several

902
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:59,070
feet of snow something like that because

903
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,510
they're closer to that polar front

904
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,880
they're closer to where those two air

905
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:06,060
masses are getting mixed up we're pretty

906
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,250
far from the poor front so we just kind

907
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,020
of get the drags right and then if you

908
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,880
get further south and they probably drew

909
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,290
this too far south because it looks here

910
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,380
we'll draw on a fake equator

911
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:20,010
there's my equator okay so when you get

912
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:22,619
down you know pretty much Mexico and

913
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,720
anywhere further south they don't know

914
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:28,820
what friends are they never have them so

915
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:32,190
fronts or a mid latitude in higher

916
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:34,560
phenomenon so in the mid latitudes and

917
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:37,670
even sometimes up towards the poles this

918
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:43,430
is where we get fronts down here

919
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:43,430
no fronts know mid-latitude cyclones

920
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:48,800
so we're going to go to this website

921
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:51,290
called NASA worldview and what it is is

922
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,990
they've got a couple satellites that

923
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:55,520
sort of travel the world like this so

924
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,740
there's always one on the opposite side

925
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,320
of the world is the other and as soon as

926
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,660
the footage comes in they post it on

927
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,880
this site and you can go back in time

928
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:09,290
several years and look at what the earth

929
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:12,530
looked like and these black stripes in

930
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:15,620
the middle you know the earth spins

931
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:18,680
faster along the equator than it does at

932
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:21,440
higher latitudes so the satellites

933
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,810
actually miss a little strip right along

934
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,300
the equator and so each one of these

935
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:29,900
stripes is another pass as it comes over

936
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:35,020
and they stitch them together here but I

937
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:38,960
can I can look I can zoom in here and

938
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:43,370
here is a classic mid-latitude cyclone

939
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,010
now that line right there that is a

940
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:47,810
artifact of them stitching these

941
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,370
satellite stripes together because

942
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,810
remember they're going around taking one

943
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,550
stripe at a time and then they have to

944
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,830
stitch them together so there's time

945
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:59,320
that has passed between one side this

946
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:02,450
image in the other so if you notice

947
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,860
here's this classic commish ape here's

948
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,690
another here's a smaller one so these

949
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,030
are both mid-latitude cyclones

950
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:12,530
I don't sue me in a little bit here not

951
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:17,410
that much and the low the center of low

952
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:19,010
pressure would be right there and the

953
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:21,710
let's see here

954
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:25,430
let's go so you see all this wispy stuff

955
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:27,950
that Cirrus okay so someone from the

956
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,690
ground that's standing over here this

957
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:33,680
whole thing is spinning counterclockwise

958
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:36,350
and moving to the east that person would

959
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,780
be seeing these cirrus first and then

960
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,160
this Cirrus get thicker and then after

961
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,750
that you can't really tell what kind of

962
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,100
cause you've got but you'd go through

963
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,380
the sequence we just talked about so

964
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,690
there's our there's our Cirrus and then

965
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,120
cirrostratus is right behind it also

966
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,920
Stratus similar behind it you can't tell

967
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,050
from this where the precipitation starts

968
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,210
the nimbostratus or you know probably

969
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,260
down in this part but you can't really

970
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,990
say for sure here

971
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:04,200
so there's all of the stratiform clouds

972
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:07,170
from the warm front and then you'll

973
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:12,390
notice there's a sudden break right in

974
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:16,260
here okay and then you'll see that right

975
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:20,520
there are these spots what are the spots

976
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,530
the spots are communal Memphis towers so

977
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:26,280
every one of those spots out in the

978
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:29,630
ocean is a cow towering cumulus Nimbus

979
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,630
in fact if i zoom in a little bit

980
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,079
these don't show so well you can often

981
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:36,990
see the animals they're kind of fuzzy

982
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,730
I'll hear some so like that's an anvil

983
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:43,260
and that's the ice on the anvil kind of

984
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:46,020
floating off so if we kind of look at

985
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,960
the big picture there's cold dry air

986
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:51,329
coming down this way mixing it up with

987
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,970
warm humid air coming up from the south

988
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:54,510
they're mixing it together right along

989
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,160
here

990
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:59,130
that's what's forming the mid-latitude

991
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,549
cycle that's the warm front stuff this

992
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:04,859
is the cold front stuff so this is

993
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:08,099
what's happening along the polar front

994
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:10,500
or all around the earth all the time

995
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:14,280
okay here's it so let's check out this

996
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:17,099
other one here okay so again you can see

997
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:21,359
there's the Cirrus right and then they

998
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:24,299
get thicker and then cold airs behind

999
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:28,230
here all those all that spotty stuff

1000
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:34,200
those are all cumulonimbus towers right

1001
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:39,650
behind there if I were to go to the

1002
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,650
southern hemisphere let's see here

1003
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:48,120
so here's one in the southern hemisphere

1004
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:50,270
it's spinning the wrong way right it's

1005
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,890
going it's spinning it has a clockwise

1006
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:55,170
spiral to it everything because of the

1007
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:58,370
Coriolis effect everything's backwards

1008
00:51:55,170 --> 00:52:01,590
down there but they're all around

1009
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:04,740
they're all around Antarctica all the

1010
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:06,540
times so here's a satellite loop looking

1011
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,210
at a mid latitude cycle and it's going

1012
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:12,060
to form right in here and then we'll see

1013
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:14,430
it mature and we'll see it move so we're

1014
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:18,210
going to go a one frame at a time here

1015
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:20,730
and so right there you can see here

1016
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,090
comes the cold air coming down from the

1017
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,380
north

1018
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:26,640
there is the warm air moving up from the

1019
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:29,100
south and now they're mingling and now

1020
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,630
we get that classic commish ape

1021
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,030
that's what mid-latitude cyclones look

1022
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:37,410
like when they're mature and the

1023
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:39,360
low-pressure is somewhere in here and it

1024
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,430
wraps around now you can see the spiral

1025
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,550
that's where the low is you can see the

1026
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:48,900
speckles those are the cumulonimbus and

1027
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:50,880
this is all the stratiform clouds and

1028
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:54,600
you can see it as it spirals it's also

1029
00:52:50,880 --> 00:53:01,290
moving to the to the east right so it's

1030
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:04,830
headed towards the continent and so what

1031
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:06,630
what can happen is especially over the

1032
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,640
ocean the mid-latitude cyclone is

1033
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:11,130
conspiring spiral and spiral so if we

1034
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,780
tried to draw fronts on this it'd be

1035
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:15,150
more complicated than the one that i

1036
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,400
just drew the the fronts would actually

1037
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:21,030
wrap all the way around here plus you

1038
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,860
get some occluded fronts in there so

1039
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:26,310
that's what mid-latitude cyclone looks

1040
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,930
like as it then matures okay and then it

1041
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:34,950
goes on to the we were back to where we

1042
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:36,990
started also this is what a mid-latitude

1043
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,400
cyclone looks like in terms of

1044
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:41,220
precipitation so we're looking at

1045
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,940
Doppler radar so all these colors are

1046
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:48,750
precipitation and so we don't see clouds

1047
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:52,560
here but the low is kind of centered in

1048
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:54,240
here this is mostly all warm front stuff

1049
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,240
so this is that steady rain we were

1050
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,830
talking about

1051
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:02,109
and makes this comma shaped blob of

1052
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:04,630
precipitation okay so that's classic

1053
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:07,930
mid-latitude cyclone precipitation

1054
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:10,660
pattern let's go back to earth thought

1055
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:12,490
no school done that again and so last

1056
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:16,000
time we were here we were looking at

1057
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:17,830
total precipitable water and so this is

1058
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,630
where we are again and again just making

1059
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:23,109
the point that that's the mid-latitude

1060
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:25,030
cyclone counterclockwise rotation we're

1061
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:27,609
bringing up warm humid air from below

1062
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:29,080
from the south or taking cold dry air

1063
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:31,390
from the north and we're mixing them

1064
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:33,580
together now I'm going to turn this

1065
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:38,040
around and look at the southern

1066
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:40,990
hemisphere and what I notice is that

1067
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:43,510
that's a clockwise spot over there

1068
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:45,369
clockwise spiral clockwise spiral these

1069
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:47,800
are all mid-latitude cyclones in the

1070
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:52,690
southern hemisphere and you can see like

1071
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:56,080
this one for example is bringing warm

1072
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:58,119
humid air from the north bringing it

1073
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:01,900
down and mixing it with cold

1074
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:04,359
drier air from the south so this is

1075
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,500
happening all the time around the

1076
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:07,390
Northern Hemisphere and the southern

1077
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,570
hemisphere we have these mid-latitude

1078
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:13,450
cyclones that travel around in a giant

1079
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:16,930
circle where the polar front is the

1080
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:21,339
thing is during our let me change I'm

1081
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:22,990
gonna go back here okay so now I'm

1082
00:55:21,339 --> 00:55:25,960
looking at temperature 700 millibars

1083
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:27,940
again that's the polar front the storms

1084
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,930
are going to follow the polar front more

1085
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:35,410
or less so right now you can see that

1086
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:38,890
will turn the wind off you can see that

1087
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:40,349
the polar front time right today goes

1088
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:43,540
kind of right through the United States

1089
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:45,190
so any storms mid-latitude cyclones are

1090
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:48,040
going to kind of come through this way

1091
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:51,520
right now if we came back in the summer

1092
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:53,859
and we looked at it in July we would see

1093
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,500
that this pool of cold air is much

1094
00:55:53,859 --> 00:56:00,190
smaller it'll be way up in here so let's

1095
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:02,410
do a demo of that real quick so here

1096
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:06,400
I've just changed it to look at a day in

1097
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:08,960
August and so you can see the pool of

1098
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,109
cold air around the North Pole ISM

1099
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:15,560
much smaller than it was a minute ago

1100
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:18,859
so there's the polar front and from our

1101
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:21,170
perspective it's all to the north of us

1102
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:23,330
sofa mid-latitude cyclone forms it's

1103
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:26,660
going to form along this boundary which

1104
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:28,910
is further to the north and we are so as

1105
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,920
far as we're concerned it doesn't exist

1106
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,119
right so if it doesn't if it doesn't

1107
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,390
happen to the United States it doesn't

1108
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:38,270
exist so in our winter we have

1109
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:41,510
mid-latitude cyclones so we say winter

1110
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:44,180
storms and then they move further to the

1111
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:45,859
north in our summer we don't notice them

1112
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,900
at all but they are still around and

1113
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:51,380
they're not as strong but they are up

1114
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,660
here to the north so one more thing

1115
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:56,510
about build latitude cyclones here I've

1116
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:59,030
got a storm that at first looks like a

1117
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:01,970
mid-latitude cyclone but when you look

1118
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:05,830
at it you realize it's missing that slot

1119
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:08,450
of cold air that we saw in the previous

1120
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:10,430
images and it doesn't have that

1121
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:13,640
characteristic comma-shaped

1122
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:17,630
it is more symmetrical so this is a

1123
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:20,210
hurricane and hurricanes are structured

1124
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:22,880
completely differently than mid-latitude

1125
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:25,760
cyclones so what they have in common is

1126
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,369
that they have Cirrus out on the edges

1127
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,990
ok that's similar and they spin

1128
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:33,440
counterclockwise in the northern

1129
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:37,270
hemisphere but they they do their thing

1130
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:41,240
completely differently so for one thing

1131
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:43,099
mid-latitude cyclone means it's not low

1132
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,740
latitudes it's not high latitudes it's

1133
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:48,380
in the middle

1134
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:50,839
hurricanes form at low latitudes ok so

1135
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:54,349
there's a there's a they're physically

1136
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:59,089
in different places on the earth let's

1137
00:57:54,349 --> 00:58:03,710
talk about the structure of hurricanes

1138
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:06,830
here so here we have a hurricane cross

1139
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:11,750
section and you think of hurricanes as

1140
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:15,020
these organized bands of cumulonimbus so

1141
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:17,750
if this thing were the pass over you you

1142
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:20,450
would have a heavy rain from this band

1143
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,520
of cumulonimbus and then heavy rain from

1144
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:24,620
this band of cumulonimbus but in but

1145
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,480
Queen there's a little breaks I mean

1146
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:29,270
you're in a hurricane so break is

1147
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,570
relevant but it's the precipitation is

1148
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:35,480
decreased in between these now that

1149
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:37,880
means that air within a hurricane is

1150
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,000
going up and feeding all of these

1151
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:44,200
cumulonimbus towers all that air going

1152
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,390
up some of it has to come back down and

1153
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,850
a lot of it comes down through the eye

1154
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:52,340
so you may have heard that in the eye of

1155
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:54,650
a hurricane you can see the sky which is

1156
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:58,010
true because sinking air fights cloud

1157
00:58:54,650 --> 00:59:00,560
formations so when this comes across

1158
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:03,500
you've got relatively low pressure under

1159
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,780
most of this hurricane and that kind of

1160
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:09,230
sucks the sea up a little bit call it a

1161
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:11,120
pressure driven surge then there's a

1162
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:13,160
bigger effect from the winds that kind

1163
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,630
of blow the ocean into a pile underneath

1164
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:17,660
the hurricane it's called a wind driven

1165
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:20,000
surge when this comes ashore this blob

1166
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,920
of water comes ashore with it and that

1167
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,530
is kind of what we refer to as the surge

1168
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:30,530
and it can flood the coastline now

1169
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:32,330
hurricanes form at low latitudes but

1170
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:34,040
they actually don't form right at the

1171
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:37,940
equator and the reason for that is

1172
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:40,040
because you need some Coriolis force for

1173
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:42,440
the thing to spin so when we were

1174
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,030
talking about Coriolis effect we didn't

1175
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,680
really talk about this I don't think but

1176
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:48,530
right on the equator

1177
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,270
nothing spins okay so storms don't spin

1178
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:52,250
at the equator you got to be a little

1179
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,800
bit north or a little bit south to get

1180
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:57,560
the Coriolis effect so hurricanes will

1181
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,660
spin up kind of right in around through

1182
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,090
here in our neck of the woods and then

1183
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,610
once they're formed they may drift

1184
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:06,890
further north and in fact they get into

1185
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:09,830
the area that we call the mid latitudes

1186
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:12,500
right so mid-latitude cyclones are up in

1187
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:15,590
here and occasionally a hurricane could

1188
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,810
go far enough north that it could get

1189
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:20,270
into that territory but hurricanes are

1190
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:22,220
pretty much forming pretty close to the

1191
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:25,190
equator a little bit north and a little

1192
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:27,530
bit south in this region that's red this

1193
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:30,350
is the area of the ocean that has the

1194
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:33,070
highest sea surface temperatures and so

1195
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:35,690
higher ocean temperatures mean more

1196
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,000
evaporation which means more dew point

1197
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,040
which

1198
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,170
means the hurricane is easier to form

1199
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:44,310
it's easier to form cumulonimbus when

1200
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:45,570
you have hot humid air okay so that's

1201
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,450
everything we're going to say about

1202
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:50,360
mid-latitude cyclones this time and next

1203
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,890
time we're going to get into worldwide

1204
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,220
atmospheric circulation thanks for

1205
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,220
watching

1206
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,300
you
