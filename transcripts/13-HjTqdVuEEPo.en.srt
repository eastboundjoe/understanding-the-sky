1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,780
hey this is Mel strong and this lecture

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,950
is on global circulation patterns and

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,660
what we're going to do is we're going to

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,029
take a lot of the things that we learned

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,890
about weather from the previous lectures

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,740
and kind of combine them all together

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,240
and look all around the earth and notice

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,390
that there are certain weather patterns

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,330
that we see in certain areas so we're

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,140
gonna start with Earth cool Schoolnet

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,059
and we're going to look at surface winds

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,469
at first so that's what I've got up here

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,430
right now

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,960
the colors represents wind speed so the

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,420
green means the winds are going a little

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,739
faster blue means the winds are going a

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,879
little slower and I'm gonna zoom in here

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,590
along the equator

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
okay so we're out here in the Pacific

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,390
Ocean and that line right there is the

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,510
equator and what we see is that we've

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,910
got winds that are coming up here

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,280
they're coming down from the Northeast

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,549
and from down here they're coming from

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,549
the southeast and they both kind of

26
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,100
flatten out and in turn almost exactly

27
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,979
from the east kind of in this zone right

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:23,970
here okay and if we go over and look at

29
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:26,159
let's say the Atlantic Ocean so again we

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,470
see I was oome in a little more here so

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,689
again that's the equator so we've got

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,049
winds coming up from the southeast and

33
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,390
they kind of flatten out and turn almost

34
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:40,860
perfectly due east here and then we have

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,759
wind's coming from the Northeast coming

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,520
through here so the big picture that we

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,220
see along the earth pretty much every

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,040
day is that there's this zone of winds

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,729
along the equator that are coming from

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,820
the east

41
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,729
maybe north east maybe south east and so

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,680
we call these winds the easterlies all

43
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,020
right so all these ones you see here

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,689
which have an easterly component are

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,530
called the easterlies also known as the

46
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:13,300
trade winds also known as the trades

47
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:17,980
okay so I'm gonna zoom back in here

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,200
and notice that if we have winds that

49
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,060
are traveling from the southeast and

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,120
ones that are traveling toward from the

51
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,410
Northeast they are both on a collision

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,360
course and you can see right in here

53
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,340
right through there they they are

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,970
running into each other in other words

55
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,920
they are converging and if I look over

56
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:43,390
here in the Pacific

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,430
I can see something similar let me go

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,160
right over in here so that line right

59
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,930
there is our equator and we've got winds

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,120
coming down from the Northeast ones

61
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,910
coming up from the southeast and they

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,150
are colliding with each other along this

63
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,610
zone right through here so that's called

64
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,070
a convergence zone and in fact this

65
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,540
whole area where it winds from the

66
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,300
southern hemisphere and winds from the

67
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,820
northern hemisphere are coming together

68
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,600
near the equator and converging that's

69
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,820
called the Intertropical Convergence

70
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,050
zone okay now I'm gonna go back and

71
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,820
forth between that animation and this

72
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,120
drawing here that I'm going to make so

73
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,030
right now what I've got is I'm trying to

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,200
draw the earth big circle and I've

75
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:35,650
sketched in the equator here so what I'm

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,810
gonna add to this is what we're what we

77
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:43,390
just saw so we've got winds that are

78
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:46,090
coming down from the east and they are

79
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,220
converging and they're not doing it

80
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,490
right on the equator but we're kind of

81
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:58,000
close to the equator this zone is called

82
00:03:51,490 --> 00:04:03,100
the I T C Z enter tropical convergence

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,890
zone so this is happening all along the

84
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,090
equator I'm not going to draw it all the

85
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:12,310
way across but you get the point so if

86
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,350
you've got winds that are coming from

87
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,540
the north ish and winds that are coming

88
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,910
from the south ish and they're they both

89
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,080
have a they're coming from the east then

90
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,700
they're going to combine and collide

91
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,620
they've got to go somewhere right if

92
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,070
you've got two sources of one coming

93
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,470
together

94
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,540
and they hit each other they can't go

95
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:40,540
down so the only option is to go up now

96
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:43,960
what that does let's go back here and

97
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:48,820
I'm going to change this to temperature

98
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,790
and so now we so the colors now

99
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,650
represent temperature and you notice

100
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,170
that we have this band of really warm

101
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,990
water which is represented by this

102
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,540
orange color all along this area that

103
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,370
we're calling the tropical Intertropical

104
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,360
Convergence zone all the winds in that

105
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,320
orange zone sort of have a easterly

106
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,750
trajectory right they're coming out of

107
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,470
the east and we see this over here in

108
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:18,370
the Atlantic okay so so we've got really

109
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:22,270
warm water and then we've got winds that

110
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:25,870
are converging and then if I go and look

111
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,090
at total precipitable water we've done

112
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,620
this before in the previous lecture we

113
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,930
see that there is a band a really high

114
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,350
humid high dew point air air that's

115
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,240
really high in humidity so these these

116
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,670
aqua colors would represent air with

117
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,030
really high mixing ratios or dew points

118
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:48,520
so we've got air that's warm it's very

119
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,360
humid and you've got converging winds

120
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,360
and all of those things mean that this

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,790
wind when it converges has to rise and

122
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,380
when the draw that kind of coming off

123
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,650
the edge of the earth out into space

124
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,930
here and they're the perfect conditions

125
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,220
for making convective weather

126
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:12,640
cumulonimbus so I'm gonna draw a big

127
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,350
cumulonimbus now I am greatly greatly

128
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,610
exaggerating the size of this thing

129
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:21,520
because if this was true to scale the

130
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,010
entire atmosphere would be the thickness

131
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,670
of this line right so I'm just doing

132
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,290
this for illustration so when winds come

133
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,000
together in the convergent zone they

134
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:35,320
have to go somewhere so they go up and

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,480
they go up through this cumulonimbus and

136
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,100
if you remember back when we talked

137
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,370
about layers of the atmosphere they

138
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,160
it rises until it hits the tropopause

139
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:51,160
but so the stratosphere is above here

140
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,740
and then they curve and some of it moves

141
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,270
north so some of it moves south and

142
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,930
we'll talk more about that in a little

143
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,980
bit so we got perfect conditions along

144
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,200
the ITCZ

145
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,880
to form cumulonimbus and we can see the

146
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,310
effects of this in a couple different

147
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,810
ways so for one thing I'm going to go to

148
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,940
this is the world view site that we've

149
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,160
seen a couple times now and just to

150
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,990
remind you there are two satellites that

151
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,870
orbit on the opposite sides of the

152
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,240
planet at all times and they make these

153
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,740
images by taking stripes at each

154
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,930
satellite makes and they stitch them

155
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,070
together and the satellites miss a

156
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,820
little bit here in the middle that's

157
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:35,390
black right okay so look at the big

158
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:38,930
picture here I see that right here right

159
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:42,160
through there there's this kind of band

160
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,690
of white and I'll zoom in a little bit

161
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,810
so these clusters that you see they're

162
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,510
kind of roundish these are all giant

163
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,990
clusters of cumulonimbus this is where

164
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,670
the ITCZ is occurring today and it's

165
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,210
occurring right around their own zoomin

166
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,980
over here

167
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,930
and you can see a zoom in a little bit

168
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,120
that's the ice coming from the anvil

169
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,730
right so you've got a big cluster

170
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,100
cumulonimbus here and the fuzziness is

171
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,950
the ice from the anvil that's kind of

172
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,830
floating off okay so that's one way we

173
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:20,000
can look at it I'm gonna change my tool

174
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:22,250
and right now I'm going to look at

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,060
Google Earth and I'm looking at the

176
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,640
Google Earth cloud layer and this uses a

177
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,240
different type of technology to show

178
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,219
clouds and for one thing there's a lot

179
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,280
less clouds here

180
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,660
to look at and so what we're looking at

181
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,750
here is something called an infrared

182
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:44,710
image so let me explain what that mean

183
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:50,330
what that means

184
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:53,480
so clouds imagine we've got the ocean

185
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,980
and we were thinking if we think about

186
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,550
the

187
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,320
pictures of the tops of the clouds okay

188
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:02,829
we got a bunch of stratocumulus let's

189
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,399
say maybe we've got some fog the tops of

190
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:08,620
the temperatures of those clouds are

191
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,709
going to be fairly warm compared to the

192
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,860
tops of really tall clouds I

193
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:18,310
cumulonimbus right so if you had a

194
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,139
satellite that's up here and it's going

195
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,360
around the earth looking for

196
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:26,290
temperatures and it's measuring the

197
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,089
temperature say of this cumulonimbus

198
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,850
it's going to see a very cold

199
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:33,130
temperature whereas if it looks at the

200
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,209
bottom I'm sorry the tops of the strata

201
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,800
cumulus clouds

202
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,079
it's going to see a much warmer

203
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,389
temperature so these satellites as

204
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:41,769
they're going over they're actually just

205
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:45,600
measuring temperature these are called

206
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:48,190
infrared images and one of the

207
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,720
advantages of taking pictures of clouds

208
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,699
in the infrared is that you don't need

209
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,639
daylight so you can see them in the dark

210
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:57,850
and the other advantage is that if

211
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:01,300
you're just interested in the cold areas

212
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:04,870
that means you will only get these cold

213
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,360
cloud top temperatures in the settle it

214
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,010
will ignore all of this stuff okay so

215
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,040
that's what's happening here in Google

216
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:14,529
Earth what we're looking at are places

217
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,839
where the clouds are very cold which

218
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,910
means they're very tall right so we're

219
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,649
we have managed to filter out all the

220
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:27,310
low-level clouds so we kind of see here

221
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,199
there's a band so we're going across the

222
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,870
Indian Ocean here we see a band of these

223
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:34,510
white blobs a bunch of them here in

224
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,899
central Africa and these are giant

225
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,420
clusters of cumulonimbus along the ITCZ

226
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,970
and you have to realize how big these

227
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,910
things are like this thing right here

228
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,610
would be the size of several large US

229
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,579
states right if this thing was on let's

230
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,079
say we just pick this up and put it over

231
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,269
the middle of the country United States

232
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,589
it would be breaking all kinds of

233
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,690
precipitation records eV and they're

234
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,339
gonna get several inches of rain out of

235
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,529
each one of these blobs that you see

236
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,940
here and this is happening every day

237
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:11,740
along the equator along this itcz zone

238
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:13,180
and zoom out a little bit okay so it

239
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,420
kind of falls apart there but then it

240
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:22,630
comes back a lot of activity here over

241
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:24,340
Central South America and we don't have

242
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,080
it's not very well-established today but

243
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,870
many days you'll see a string of

244
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,320
cumulonimbus across the Pacific kind of

245
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,240
right in here and it varies day to day

246
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,060
so the actual activity of the ITCZ

247
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,130
varies day to day so today it looks like

248
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,730
you can see it quite a bit over there

249
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,890
central South America Central Africa

250
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,000
also notice why I've got Africa up

251
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:53,260
notice that northern Africa very very

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,130
dry very Brown south tip of Africa very

253
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,800
dry very Brown Central Africa very green

254
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,970
and the reason is that it's the central

255
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,310
part of Africa resides in the ITCZ

256
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,550
so they get these tremendous

257
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,590
thunderstorms

258
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:12,880
you know I said almost every day or they

259
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:15,970
get inches of rain at a time so let's

260
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,600
return to our drawing here and we can

261
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:24,240
add in I'm going to add in a bunch of

262
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,240
circles to represent these cumulonimbus

263
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,450
right all along the equator here in this

264
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:36,250
end of tropical convergence zone so

265
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,600
these again extend all the way around

266
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,050
the equator I'm just not going to draw

267
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,570
them all we can also see some other

268
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:49,000
evidence from this and we're going to go

269
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:50,589
back to earth little Schoolnet and one

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,940
of the things I'm going to do now is I'm

271
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:58,960
going to change this to three HPA which

272
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:02,890
means three hours of precipitation

273
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,870
accumulation so this map is showing the

274
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,440
colors now our precipitation has fallen

275
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:11,650
in the last three hours and there's a

276
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,870
couple patterns here first one to to

277
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:17,920
talk about what we were just looking at

278
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,780
the ITCZ see this band right here going

279
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,710
right through them right kind of along

280
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,710
the equator that's

281
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,850
itcz those are all blobs of

282
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:31,500
precipitation that are from cumulonimbus

283
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:33,760
here it gets it's pretty broad here and

284
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,220
there's just it kind of splits into two

285
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,260
but then if you go back Pacific Ocean

286
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,050
there's kind of a narrow band there all

287
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:44,410
those are little little blobs you know

288
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,930
cumulonimbus makes a fairly narrow blob

289
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:50,410
of precipitation right so that's what

290
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,630
we're seeing now while we're at it we

291
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:56,410
can see some totally different types of

292
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:59,500
precipitation see that you know what

293
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,750
that is so that's that classic commish

294
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,340
ape that's a mid latitude cycle and

295
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,620
that's the precipitation that was

296
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,270
produced in the last three hours from a

297
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,360
mid latitude cycle and you can see the

298
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,350
counterclockwise swirling of the wind

299
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,210
there's another one that's a little

300
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,920
harder to see but it kind of has a comma

301
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,200
shape that's the mid-latitude cyclone

302
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,660
this is another one that's a weird shape

303
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,850
and if you go around the world we can

304
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,670
see more of those comma shaped things

305
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,220
those are the mid-latitude cyclones but

306
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,710
for now what we're talking about is the

307
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:34,120
activity along the equator along the

308
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:37,360
ITCZ also I'm going to change the

309
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:43,870
overlay to mean sea level pressure MSL P

310
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:46,510
and so to remind you purple means

311
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,960
low-pressure the whitish color means

312
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:52,330
high pressure and back when we talked

313
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,770
about this I did this before when when I

314
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,560
showed this to you and I said that

315
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,980
notice that there is a purplish band

316
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,500
around the equator and this is due to

317
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,140
the fact that air is rising every day

318
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,350
along the equator now you and I use this

319
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,800
as an example of a thermal low it's so

320
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:15,370
warm the dew point is so high that you

321
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,920
get convection every day and that

322
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,620
produces lower pressure at the surface

323
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,110
so we can see it on this one pretty well

324
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,080
over the Pacific on this day a big band

325
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,220
a fairly low pressure so I'm going to

326
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:34,290
add that and I'm going to add some ELLs

327
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:36,600
here to remind myself that this is

328
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,040
a band of low pressure so again these

329
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,240
features are all the way around the

330
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,649
earth

331
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,350
you've got converging winds you a

332
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,940
cumulonimbus you've got low pressure all

333
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,699
these things I'm destroying them as

334
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:52,860
little chunks here but they would go all

335
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:55,709
the way around the earth okay so if the

336
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,029
air rises in again this is happening all

337
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,389
the way around the earth where you have

338
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:03,060
these rising plumes of air that turn

339
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:05,699
into cumulonimbus and then that air hits

340
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,750
the stratosphere and it can't go into

341
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,160
the stratosphere because the

342
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,529
stratosphere has this big temperature

343
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,709
inversion it has to go somewhere so some

344
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:16,680
of it goes north some of it goes south

345
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:18,180
now as it goes north and south and again

346
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,100
I'm greatly exaggerating the height

347
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,209
above the ground right just keep that in

348
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,339
mind it travels for a while and it it's

349
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:29,550
cooling it's radiating energy out in the

350
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:33,180
space and it starts to cool and then it

351
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:39,630
starts to come back down and both north

352
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:42,440
and south cut the air that rose at the

353
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:47,490
equator tends to come down right around

354
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,550
more or less 30 degrees north and 30

355
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:54,740
degrees south so I'm going to put down

356
00:16:49,550 --> 00:17:00,750
30 degrees and then there's another zone

357
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:02,819
30 degrees south or this also happens so

358
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,919
let's think about and I'm just going to

359
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:06,360
basically ignore the southern hemisphere

360
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,130
but just realize that everything we're

361
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,110
talking about today up in the northern

362
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:14,909
hemisphere is happening also in the

363
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:18,959
southern southern hemisphere so here we

364
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:22,049
have sinking air so what does sinking

365
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,439
air do so if you have air sinking down

366
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:27,780
from the upper parts of the atmosphere

367
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:31,200
that produces high pressure along the

368
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,470
surface right so right here where this

369
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,070
air is sinking you would expect a high

370
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,600
pressure and in fact if this pattern is

371
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,600
happening all the way around the equator

372
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,480
you also have air that is sinking all

373
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,590
the way around the 30 degree mark so you

374
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,860
would have a band

375
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:53,789
and you would expect a band of high

376
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:56,159
pressures going all the way across now

377
00:17:53,789 --> 00:18:04,169
we have a name for these they are called

378
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:08,880
the sub tropical highs a the subtropical

379
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:11,640
highs so if the earth was completely

380
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,980
water and there is no continents there'd

381
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,440
be a lot more symmetry to the patterns

382
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,990
we're talking about we have a perfect

383
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,539
band of cumulonimbus around the equator

384
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,399
every day we'd have a perfect band of

385
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,610
high pressure right around 30 degrees

386
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:28,919
every day but what actually happens is

387
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,649
you've got continents and the continents

388
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,010
heat up quicker during the day than the

389
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:37,470
oceans and that tends to send air up and

390
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,380
that tends to fight off say this high

391
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,929
pressure so what really happens is this

392
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,789
height that I'm drawing as a band it

393
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,919
kind of breaks up into certain zones

394
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:49,830
over the ocean and I'll show that in a

395
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,899
minute but just for now let's just kind

396
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,049
of continue this week this band of high

397
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:59,850
pressures is expected around 30 degrees

398
00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:02,190
north and 30 degrees south so this loop

399
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,730
that we have where air rises at the

400
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:10,080
equator and it goes 30 degrees north and

401
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:16,049
it comes back down now this loop is

402
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:18,360
called the Hadley cell ok the Headlee

403
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:21,440
cell and this is one of the general

404
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,500
circulation patterns in the earth that

405
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,210
air generally rises from the equator

406
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,880
sinks back down at 30 degrees north and

407
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:33,809
30 degrees south okay so when air is

408
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:36,360
sinking makes a high pressure what

409
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:39,000
direction does the wind blow around a

410
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,809
high in the northern hemisphere goes

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,980
clockwise right so you can imagine that

412
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:50,640
if I had one single high I would draw a

413
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:53,520
clockwise spiral around it but I have a

414
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,649
band of them so you have to kind of

415
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,649
imagine a whole bunch a clockwise

416
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,649
spirals

417
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:12,780
like this and these spirals that I'm

418
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:14,670
drawing to the north of the H combine to

419
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,250
form what we winds that are coming

420
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:27,620
primarily from the West called the

421
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:27,620
westerlies and these are combining -

422
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:36,900
these are combining to provide what we

423
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,160
call easterly's alright so we've talked

424
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,870
about that's where we started is with

425
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,240
the easterlies now we can see that the

426
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,810
east rubies down here a part of a big

427
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,910
loop that formed when the air rose goes

428
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,630
to 30 degrees north 30 degrees south

429
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:54,300
sinks down in the northern hemisphere

430
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:58,440
makes high pressure clockwise rotation

431
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,720
around the highs and and the clockwise

432
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,900
rotation south of each one of these H's

433
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,390
combines to produce a band of wind that

434
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,940
we call the easterlies and to the north

435
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:13,020
a band of wind that we call the

436
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:15,630
westerlies so we're going to return to

437
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,070
our map of air pressure here so where we

438
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,460
left off we were talking about this

439
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:22,050
thermal low around the equator now to

440
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,810
orient yourself so there's the United

441
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:29,760
States is Hawaii notice what's this big

442
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:32,820
spiral out in the ocean here and another

443
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,250
one so clockwise rotation that's

444
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,570
consistent with a high pressure here's

445
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:41,130
another one high pressure

446
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:44,010
here's another one right around the same

447
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,620
latitude high pressure a little one

448
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,420
there okay so what we're seeing is we're

449
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:52,220
seeing high pressure blobs a high

450
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:55,770
pressure these are the subtropical highs

451
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,480
and again if the earth was all water we

452
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,730
would see a band of them all the way

453
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,400
across but what actually happens is they

454
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,860
tend to kind of form more over the ocean

455
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,710
basins and we see so a little bit here

456
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,730
in Europe I go the southern hemisphere

457
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,880
here's a bunch of in the southern

458
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,070
hemisphere that white blob that white

459
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,420
blob record you know

460
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,920
they're spinning in the opposite

461
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:20,470
direction because of the Coriolis effect

462
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:23,510
down there but you've got these blobs of

463
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,640
sinking air that are in this case

464
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,040
spinning counterclockwise and are the

465
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,180
neck of the woods spinning clockwise

466
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:37,100
these are set these subtropical highs

467
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:39,260
now subtropical highs tend to so they

468
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,200
tend to farm over the ocean basins and

469
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,750
they kind of tend to be found kind of in

470
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,560
the same place day to day so if we did

471
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,870
this tomorrow

472
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,700
we would notice that that big

473
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,700
high-pressure blob right there is still

474
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,500
there and day to day moves around a

475
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,260
little bit it might join forces with

476
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,600
that one then they split apart this one

477
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,330
also kind of moves around day to day if

478
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,430
we compared winter versus summer we

479
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:09,250
would see that they move quite a bit

480
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:12,200
more in the seasons but these these

481
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:15,170
subtropical highs are are very

482
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,530
consistent and so we give them names

483
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:22,100
this one right out here is called the

484
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,630
Pacific subtropical high so this is the

485
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,660
one that's parked right off the west

486
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:32,530
coast of the United States and you'll

487
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:35,660
notice that so right along the coast

488
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:38,650
it's actually under the influence of

489
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:42,320
these winds from this big spinning

490
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:44,900
subtropical high so the presence of this

491
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,560
high right off the coasts really affects

492
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:51,080
the weather on the west coast and in

493
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,800
fact it in could that includes New

494
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,300
Mexico this is a big blob of sinking air

495
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,760
if you have a big blob of sinking air

496
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,250
sitting right out here over the ocean

497
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,980
and it kind of bleeds over to the

498
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:07,190
continent that means that the west coast

499
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:09,950
and Baja California in Arizona and New

500
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,530
Mexico are all at times under the

501
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:16,130
influence of this big blob of sinking

502
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,720
air which means if you have sinking air

503
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,440
high pressure that fights cloud

504
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,780
formation that tends to make deserts

505
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,900
right so if you think about the climate

506
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:29,960
of what it's like over in here in the

507
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,020
Coffee desert a21 desert Arizona New

508
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,350
Mexico there why is it all so dry out

509
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:39,770
here well it's due to this Pacific

510
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:43,760
subtropical high so think about the big

511
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:48,530
picture here air has risen from the

512
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,790
equator makes cumulonimbus you can think

513
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,230
of it as like squeezing all the water

514
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:55,160
out from the cumulonimbus

515
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:59,000
so it's dry air then it goes north then

516
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,700
it sinks sinking air warms so now you've

517
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,150
got air that's fairly warm and really

518
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,570
dry and it then hits the ground and

519
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,970
produces high pressure so so if you live

520
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,700
under here anywhere under one of these

521
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:17,300
subtropical highs you'd expect to live

522
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,700
in a zone that's very very dry ok in New

523
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,830
Mexico is one of those places in Mexico

524
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,670
Arizona Southern California we're all

525
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,820
under the Pacific subtropical high so I

526
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:32,870
want to add on this with my band of h's

527
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,840
is that I'm gonna put down deserts ok

528
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,880
all all all along this band around 30

529
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,820
degrees or so you'd expect to find

530
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,870
deserts because of this consistent

531
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,550
sinking air from the Hadley cell so we

532
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,070
can look at the subtropical has a

533
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,430
different way and I am now back in

534
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,650
Google Earth looking at clouds again and

535
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,890
what I notice so there's California

536
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:00,050
right there I noticed that there's this

537
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,390
big area out here in the ocean where

538
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,550
there's no clouds now remember these are

539
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,190
infrared images so they only show tall

540
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:10,190
clouds so there could be fog or

541
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,190
stratocumulus something like that but no

542
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:15,860
tall clouds out here why is that that's

543
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,460
the Pacific subtropical high this whole

544
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:22,550
thing is a giant clockwise spinning blob

545
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:25,490
of high pressure sinking air fights

546
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,170
cloud formation so you see this big area

547
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,630
in the ocean where there's no clouds we

548
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,890
snow tall clouds or could go to the

549
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:35,810
southern hemisphere and right down here

550
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,670
it spins in the opposite direction beat

551
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,160
you it would be counterclockwise but

552
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,930
right here is another big blob

553
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,120
high-pressure seeking air from the

554
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:47,720
subtropical highs and again we see

555
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:53,900
almost no clouds no tall clouds are we

556
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:56,900
could go over here so again roughly in

557
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,820
the same area in latitude big blob out

558
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:03,620
here in the ocean no clouds

559
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:05,960
so subtropical highs areas of sinking

560
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,320
air that originated from the equator

561
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,840
produces high pressure and that in turn

562
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,110
fights cloud formation and if you live

563
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,480
under an area one of these under one of

564
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,140
these subtropical highs you're living in

565
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,840
a desert almost every time so let's look

566
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,480
for some westerlies now we're back

567
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,540
looking at surface winds the colors

568
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,240
represent wind speed and so here what I

569
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,330
see are a whole bunch of easterly's that

570
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,530
we saw previously right through here and

571
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,320
according to the diagram we've been

572
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,800
drawing we'd expect to find westerlies

573
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,020
kind of right through here but it

574
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,840
doesn't it's not real obvious here I see

575
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,500
this big clockwise spiral and that is

576
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,600
the Pacific subtropical high I've got a

577
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,260
couple counterclockwise spirals those

578
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,930
are a couple of mid-latitude cyclones

579
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,970
but nothing really looks like a wind

580
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:06,710
traveling from west to east like we just

581
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:09,610
drew so what I'm gonna do is change the

582
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:13,310
height and I'm gonna go to 700 millibars

583
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:16,250
700 millibars again is roughly somewhere

584
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:18,740
around 10 to 12,000 feet above the

585
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,930
surface and notice how different the

586
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,340
winds look up there so the colors again

587
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,280
represent

588
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,230
speed so when you see this those are

589
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,020
some really high speed winds I don't

590
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,640
know how high but I would not be

591
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,460
surprised if some of these in here were

592
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,510
100 miles an hour or something like that

593
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,250
so what we see it's look around the

594
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:40,250
earth here we can see that we've got

595
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:43,010
these ribbons of wind that are kind of

596
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,170
intermittent right so over here over

597
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:48,860
Asia you don't see them and then they

598
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:53,230
start over the as we go over the Pacific

599
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:55,000
and this one goes no

600
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,840
earth comes up into Alaska and then back

601
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,730
down and then fades away a little bit

602
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,530
comes back across North America and then

603
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,000
there's a bunch of little you know got

604
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,510
some mid-latitude cyclones in here as

605
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,200
well

606
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:13,960
but the point is that if I were to say

607
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,570
drop you off in a balloon okay I just

608
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,679
drop you off somewhere over here you

609
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:21,429
would get caught in one of these

610
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,500
currents and you be you know you go for

611
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:26,049
a ride for sure you might go through a

612
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,360
few loop-de-loops here and you know

613
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:30,340
there's chances where your path could

614
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,950
split one way or the other but

615
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,860
eventually eventually you would make

616
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,450
your way around the world from west to

617
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,340
east you know if you just stayed in

618
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,020
these streams long enough you'll

619
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,240
eventually make your way all the way

620
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,020
around the world back roughly where you

621
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,809
started

622
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,460
these are the westerlies okay so it

623
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:51,940
looks quite different than what we drew

624
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,830
and every day you look it's it's

625
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,460
different so if I let's just go back a

626
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,620
couple days here so go back a day back

627
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,570
another day

628
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,070
okay so just I'll stop right there so

629
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,980
now you can see how different it looks

630
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:10,210
here so there's our stream coming off of

631
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:13,510
Asia and now right we have a much

632
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:16,240
thicker band across North America it's

633
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,460
really sped up coming off North America

634
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,400
over the Atlantic you can follow these

635
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,770
streams over into Europe okay so every

636
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,049
day it's a little bit different but if I

637
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:29,200
kind of tilt the earth and look down the

638
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:31,000
North Pole in general what I would see

639
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,830
from the North Pole is this

640
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,840
counterclockwise circulation

641
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,640
you know there's exceptions to this but

642
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,850
again if I dropped you off in a balloon

643
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,929
you go around and around but eventually

644
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,240
you would make your way all the way

645
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:45,100
around the world and through these

646
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,679
following these different ribbons of air

647
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,830
and these are what we call the

648
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:55,630
westerlies now I'm going to go even a

649
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:58,390
little higher up to 500 millibars so now

650
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:01,179
this is roughly how high commercial jets

651
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,980
fly and so one of the things that you

652
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:06,070
see is that the winds are now much

653
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,690
faster and so you can see this

654
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,480
this ribbon right here that's really

655
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,760
fast this ribbon right here this very

656
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,170
fast you if you've heard the term

657
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,600
Jetstream these are jets okay so these

658
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:22,480
are these ribbons of high speed moving

659
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,550
wind that are in the westerlies and when

660
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,160
forecasters talk about the jet stream

661
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:30,340
this is what they're talking about now

662
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:34,210
if I go and change the overlay to

663
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:37,210
temperature okay so now the colors

664
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,520
represent temperature and if you think

665
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,950
back a lecture we talked about how

666
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,260
there's this pool of cold air up here

667
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,090
making these Rossby waves and we talked

668
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,890
about the polar front and the polar

669
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,860
front was this division between the

670
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:53,740
warmer air and the cooler air well this

671
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,140
high-speed wind this ribbon of

672
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:59,020
westerlies that were talking about kind

673
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,270
of follows the rows be waves so in other

674
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,710
words if I look over here or that one of

675
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,070
those jet streams were right through

676
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:08,470
there it's forming kind of right on the

677
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,240
boundary between the warmer air and the

678
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,230
colder air that's forming right along

679
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,360
that polar front so if you if you are

680
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,100
watching say a weather forecast and

681
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,510
they're talking about the jet stream and

682
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,810
they say well that jet stream it's

683
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,370
coming down into New Mexico okay well

684
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,620
the reason that's important is because

685
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:29,440
the jet stream typically follows the

686
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:31,720
polar front so if the jet stream comes

687
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,880
down over New Mexico that means this

688
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,160
blob of cold air is also dipping down

689
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,460
over New Mexico at the same time at

690
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,490
least the border of it is so they'll

691
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:45,070
talk about the jet stream from time to

692
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,380
time and weather forecasts mid-latitude

693
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:50,340
cyclones typically form along that

694
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:53,530
border like we talked about last time so

695
00:32:50,340 --> 00:33:00,240
those are the westerlies now it's also

696
00:32:53,530 --> 00:33:03,700
let's go back to go back to surface and

697
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,450
let's see let's leave it on temperature

698
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:13,510
for a bit or I can straight down the

699
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:15,400
North Pole I'm gonna zoom in here okay

700
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,910
it's not very well developed today but

701
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,929
right here I think you can kind of make

702
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:24,429
out there is a

703
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:27,149
clockwise spiral here and usually over

704
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:30,279
the North Pole there is a high pressure

705
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:31,210
with clockwise rotation right right

706
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:34,419
around there

707
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:36,909
and that forms a band of wind that we're

708
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:38,440
gonna call the polar easterlies they I'm

709
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:43,230
not very well developed here but let's

710
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,230
draw a few things on our diagram here so

711
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,690
here's our westerly so our polar front

712
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:52,509
we could just kind of say something like

713
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:57,190
this always changing

714
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:58,899
right but that's an abbreviation for our

715
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:04,179
approximation sorry for where it would

716
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:06,039
be so up at the North Pole then we've

717
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:09,429
got winds that are spinning clockwise

718
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:12,129
and they they're not very well developed

719
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:14,889
in today's animation there but you've

720
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:17,429
got a high kind of near the North Pole

721
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:22,450
with these winds that are coming down

722
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:24,639
this direction and so right here right

723
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:27,040
along here is where we talked about how

724
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,010
you get the formation of mid-latitude

725
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:35,260
cyclones right so you're mixing up this

726
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:37,540
cold air with this warm air and there's

727
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,069
a pretty abrupt transition so all the

728
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,109
warm fronts and cold fronts all that

729
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:43,599
stuff we talked about in the past that's

730
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:46,569
all happening right along that boundary

731
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:51,240
there okay so just to kind of fill that

732
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:53,859
out then warm fronts make air rise

733
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,919
because of the ramp remember that from a

734
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:59,349
previous lecture cold fronts make air

735
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:03,450
rise because the cold air tunnels

736
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:06,760
underneath so you have air that's rising

737
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:08,109
along the polar front okay because of

738
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,630
those two different types of frontal

739
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:12,099
systems mid-latitude cyclones which is

740
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:16,210
what you get when you mix up these two

741
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:19,750
types of air cause air to rise so some

742
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:24,940
of that air rises and then kind of

743
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:26,290
settles down along the North Pole okay

744
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,210
so there's a nut you know this is

745
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,740
happening all the way around you know

746
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,140
again this is happening all the way

747
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,579
around the earth here so it's not just

748
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,790
rising in this one spots all the way

749
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:36,040
we're

750
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:38,230
and sinking down around the North Pole

751
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,300
creating a high-pressure clockwise

752
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:48,750
rotation around a high you get these

753
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:48,750
winds that we call the polar easterlies

754
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:56,440
you can read that polar easterlies

755
00:35:53,490 --> 00:36:00,660
alright so air is rising from mid

756
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:04,260
latitude cyclones this little loop here

757
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:10,420
is sometimes drawn and this isn't called

758
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:15,160
the ferrule cell and this is called the

759
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:17,200
polar cell and we're not really

760
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,780
emphasizing these two things the Hadley

761
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,970
cell is really the important one in this

762
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:25,930
class but you may see this from time to

763
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:27,910
time these two cells so what else do we

764
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,940
need on our diagram well the other thing

765
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,470
we could draw is those mid-latitude

766
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,720
cyclones are going to form right through

767
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,280
here as we mix up the air so I'm just

768
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,950
going to draw some kind of commish eight

769
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,740
things just to illustrate that that

770
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,740
that's where our mid-latitude cyclones

771
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,120
are going to form there

772
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,270
so

773
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,990
we kind of have a mess here but in

774
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:59,620
general this is the circulation pattern

775
00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:04,990
of the Earth's atmosphere now let's look

776
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:09,400
at a couple of the movies here so this

777
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:11,800
one we're looking at a not just clouds

778
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,080
but also water vapor so the gray that

779
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,410
you see is water vapor they're really

780
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,720
bright white or clouds and each frame is

781
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:22,600
every three hours and you can see the

782
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,140
days go by up here okay so every three

783
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,790
hours

784
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,740
there's another frame and you can see

785
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:30,550
some of these features so right through

786
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:32,530
the middle there you can see the ITCZ so

787
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,300
it's just cumulus day after day after

788
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,160
day after day you can kind of see the

789
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,390
difference between day and night they'll

790
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,950
appear during the day then they

791
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,220
disappear at night over and over and

792
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,860
over

793
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:46,600
you also see see that counterclockwise

794
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:47,740
spiral there's another one these little

795
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,710
spirals that we get those are the

796
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,990
mid-latitude cyclones okay so you'll see

797
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:56,020
the counterclockwise spirals out here

798
00:37:52,990 --> 00:38:00,400
mid-latitude cyclones the ITCZ down here

799
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:03,970
now in this image that the black is dry

800
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,850
air not near the surface but up in the

801
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,620
upper part of the troposphere and the

802
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:10,000
reason you have if you if you watch this

803
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,820
for a while you'll see that there's kind

804
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,190
of constantly this black right out in

805
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,890
here and that is our Pacific subtropical

806
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,860
high that's our sinking air from the

807
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:23,350
Hadley cell so that air coming down is

808
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,970
dry and you can see it gets mixed up

809
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,490
from time to time but it'll keep

810
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,710
reforming this dark ball the air that's

811
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:32,020
dry sinking air from the Hadley cell

812
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:37,090
very few clouds forming in this area

813
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:39,340
right because of that dry sinking air we

814
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,140
can also look at it the whole earth now

815
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,330
this one I made a little slower but it's

816
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,910
the same idea every frame is every three

817
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:49,570
hours there is a mid-latitude cyclone

818
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:52,210
there's a mid-latitude cyclone now down

819
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,220
here you've got them but they're

820
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,680
spending the opposite direction so that

821
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,190
one right there spinning clockwise

822
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,190
mid-latitude cyclone

823
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,240
okay we're getting fined another okay

824
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,950
here's another one you see these white

825
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,910
flashes that's a lot of times the

826
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:14,470
something happens when they download the

827
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,120
data off the satellite and they don't

828
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,670
get all of it so that's why it's

829
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,140
blinking like this so here and this

830
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,430
one's in the winter the last one was

831
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,700
starting in the spring and went to this

832
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:27,340
through the summer but again you can

833
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,040
kind of make out this is the ITCZ kind

834
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,380
of through here not as well formed as

835
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,600
the last movie you got mid-latitude

836
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,330
cyclones up here you got mid-latitude

837
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:42,130
cyclones down here ok so that's kind of

838
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:46,360
the global picture now if you see this

839
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:49,780
in a book it's always showing zone as a

840
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:53,050
much simpler thing so here's an example

841
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:57,010
of a text book out sorry an image out of

842
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:59,590
a textbook and what you can see is they

843
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:01,810
show okay here's the ITCZ is it's nice

844
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,880
perfectly straight line and then the

845
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,010
high is the subtropical highs are nice

846
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,750
perfectly straight line and there's the

847
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:11,710
trade winds and there's the westerlies

848
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:13,870
okay and then here's the de sel so this

849
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,030
is the Hadley cell the Farrell cell and

850
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,740
the polar cell there right so it's nice

851
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:20,590
and neat but one of the points I'm

852
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:23,410
trying to make is that it's not nearly

853
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:25,930
as nice and neat as you might read in a

854
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,760
textbook so here's another one this is

855
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,010
more three-dimensional so here they're

856
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,100
showing the ITCZ is this nice little

857
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,650
band of clouds there and then along the

858
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,120
polar front another band of clouds again

859
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,390
those are from the cold fronts and warm

860
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,900
fronts and in the oh there's the

861
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:47,110
westerlies but again it's not nearly

862
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:49,750
that nice if you averaged it over the

863
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:51,970
whole year it kind of looks like this

864
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,150
but as we saw in those movies it

865
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:57,460
definitely looks very chaotic right so

866
00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:01,810
these are just average patterns averaged

867
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:04,150
over a long period of time so one of the

868
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:07,110
small scale things that can have a big

869
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,770
effect on your climate is the topography

870
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:11,170
especially when it comes to

871
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:14,320
precipitation so let's imagine this

872
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,770
scenario we've got this ocean and a

873
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,670
cotton

874
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:22,060
and we've got a storm that's coming in

875
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:25,420
and I'm going to draw my storm as this

876
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:27,070
little tiny baby cumulonimbus cloud but

877
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,430
it represents something much more

878
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:34,450
complicated like a storm system and it's

879
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,770
coming inland and so let's let's just

880
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,950
say it's raining it's raining out in the

881
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:41,100
ocean and when it hits the continent one

882
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:46,540
of the things that's going to happen is

883
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:49,420
that storm is going to intensify and the

884
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,430
reason for that is the continent is

885
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,340
usually warmer than the ocean so it's

886
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,690
good so the storms coming along and

887
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,640
suddenly it gets a little boost of warm

888
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:01,780
air from the continent and that makes it

889
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:06,490
grow right so it starts raining more but

890
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:08,020
now this storm has to go uphill now when

891
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,930
we talked about convection we said that

892
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,390
if you can make air go up air that moves

893
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,730
up expands it cools eventually hits the

894
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,650
dew point makes a cloud if it continues

895
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,900
to go up you can eventually make ice

896
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:21,900
creates precipitation right that's how

897
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,490
you get precipitation that whole process

898
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,220
what if you already have a storm and you

899
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:30,160
make the whole storm go up the storm

900
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:33,790
will intensify so this storm that I'm

901
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:38,530
drawing as it goes up the mountain will

902
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:41,950
grow and become stronger and stronger as

903
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:44,590
it goes and I'm again simplifying by

904
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:49,990
just drawing cumulonimbus clouds here

905
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:51,940
but as it goes up the mountain it

906
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:55,210
produces more and more precipitation as

907
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:57,369
it's forced further and further up right

908
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,869
okay so this is the storm going up but

909
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:03,030
what happens when the storm goes down

910
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:07,060
well sinking air fights cloud formation

911
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:09,010
take a storm and make it go down and the

912
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,750
storm will get weaker it's going the

913
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,540
opposite direction that it needs to go

914
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,930
so what happens is as it goes down the

915
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:19,900
hill it becomes weaker

916
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:22,200
however it's not exactly symmetrical to

917
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,150
the other side because it's now lost

918
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,100
some precipitation over here right once

919
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,480
it left the ocean it doesn't really have

920
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:32,140
a source of precipitate of

921
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,660
humidity anymore so as a precipitation

922
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:37,500
is occurring you can think of this

923
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:40,780
entire column of air the dew point is

924
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,810
going down as the air moves inland right

925
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,580
it's losing water as it goes so this is

926
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:48,130
not producing as much precipitation as

927
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:51,640
it did on the other side okay so this

928
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:53,500
means that if you were to go up the

929
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,450
mountain here you you would experience

930
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,270
more and more precipitation on the way

931
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:03,460
up so we have a wet side of the mountain

932
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:07,240
and then on the other side we see a side

933
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:10,440
that's considerably drier as it goes

934
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:14,250
downhill and gets drier and drier

935
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,109
towards the bottom something like this

936
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:20,380
and so by the time the storm gets to the

937
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:22,900
bottom of this hill it's this is the

938
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,750
driest point so far but now it's gonna

939
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,350
go back up alright so now it's gonna go

940
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:32,980
back up this next Mountain so once again

941
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:38,730
the storm intensifies now it's going to

942
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,730
rain more as it grows

943
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:50,869
and like the little Mountain it's now

944
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:54,109
the precipitation is going to increase

945
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:58,579
as it goes up the second mountain so now

946
00:44:54,109 --> 00:45:05,230
we get another zone that increases with

947
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:09,650
height the wet zone right so we get that

948
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:14,900
now it comes down the other side and now

949
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:21,410
as before this storm is on its way down

950
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:24,289
and it weakens and it weakens a lot

951
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,029
because now it not only has lost all of

952
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:28,579
the precipitation coming up the first

953
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:30,619
mountain it also lost precipitation

954
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:33,200
going up the second mountain and now

955
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:35,599
it's got a long ways to go downhill so

956
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,089
this mountain this side of this mountain

957
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:43,549
that's going to be even drier on this

958
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:46,160
side than the first one so these

959
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:49,309
mountains have very different climates

960
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,579
you've got a wet side and a dry side a

961
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:58,640
wet side and the dry side this is called

962
00:45:52,579 --> 00:46:05,599
the rainshadow effect the rain shadow

963
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:07,519
effect so if you live in a place where

964
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,500
there are mountains and there's a

965
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:12,440
preferred direction that the storms come

966
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,730
from you might live on the wet side or

967
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,839
you might live on the dry side and

968
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:20,029
you'll have a completely different

969
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:22,160
climates so this goes on a lot in the

970
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:23,750
western part of the United States so

971
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,390
this is a diagram out of a textbook

972
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:29,299
showing the rain shadow of effect as a

973
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,789
storm moves in over Washington State so

974
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:34,190
they come in over the Pacific go up the

975
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:37,160
Olympic Mountains which are on the on

976
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,529
the west coast so you they intensify as

977
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,109
they go up they weaken as they go down

978
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:44,359
you have a relatively dry spot here then

979
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:46,279
they go up the Cascade Mountains which

980
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:49,130
are chain of volcanoes and they

981
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:50,690
intensify on the way up and then dry on

982
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,869
the way down then this then it's pretty

983
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:55,460
dry as we'll see in a second across

984
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:57,770
Eastern Washington State and

985
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,860
eventually they get to Idaho in tune

986
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,540
Idaho they go up the Rocky Mountains and

987
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,400
intensify again and you get a little bit

988
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:07,070
more moisture before coming down the

989
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,880
other side and it's really dry again so

990
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:13,370
we can see this on a map of

991
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:16,310
precipitation of the US so these colors

992
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:19,640
represent annual precipitation here's a

993
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:21,740
scale down here and if we look over here

994
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,050
on the west coast we can see there's a

995
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,180
kind of a purple stripe right there and

996
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,490
another purple stripe right there and

997
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,490
those are two stripes of really intense

998
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:33,470
precipitation so storms come in so

999
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,380
there's Washington state so right there

1000
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:40,190
that's the Olympic Mountains they come

1001
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,480
ashore and intensify go up hill dump a

1002
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:45,920
bunch of rain and how much rain are we

1003
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:48,740
talking here so over 100 inches so that

1004
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,230
white area 150 inches or so of rain

1005
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,510
again this can also can fall as snow but

1006
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:56,210
rain equivalent so if you are from New

1007
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:58,940
Mexico you know 150 inches of rain just

1008
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:00,500
does not compute to our brains so it's

1009
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,320
hard to imagine that but you have all

1010
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,880
this rain coming out on this mountain

1011
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,880
range here it's the west and it goes

1012
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,950
downhill you have a relatively dry spot

1013
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,520
here they didn't goes up the Cascades

1014
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:15,410
and you get another wet stripe so you've

1015
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,990
lost precipitation here you lost

1016
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:20,030
precipitation here and now the storms

1017
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:21,940
are going downhill and suddenly

1018
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:25,370
Washington State gets really dry

1019
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:27,500
Washington State is a pretty extreme

1020
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:29,150
example of the rain shadow effect it's

1021
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,720
called the Evergreen State that's their

1022
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:35,690
logo so over here it's rain forests over

1023
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,060
here see those red colors that's the

1024
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:40,940
same as most of New Mexico is actually

1025
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:43,220
areas in eastern Washington state that

1026
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,470
are drier than New Mexico so you've got

1027
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,450
desert right next to rain forest not

1028
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,430
that far apart that's the rain shadow

1029
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,020
effect storms come down hill down the

1030
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,670
hill and down the hill and then they

1031
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,380
finally get to the Rockies they start to

1032
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:57,590
go uphill again and you get

1033
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,320
intensification over here in Idaho then

1034
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,320
they go back downhill again and so now

1035
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,590
it's really dry again over here in

1036
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,010
Montana

1037
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:08,610
so that's illustration of the rain

1038
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,010
shadow effect

1039
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,630
which really affects all of the western

1040
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,190
part of the United States so you can see

1041
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:16,380
this effect all the way down here in the

1042
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:18,330
California we've got a lot of

1043
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,010
precipitation on the in the western

1044
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,110
mountains and then you've got a little

1045
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:24,750
break and then here for example that's

1046
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:26,970
the Sierra Nevada mountains same idea

1047
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,980
the storms come in you know they hit the

1048
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,930
coast they dump they get into Central

1049
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,850
Valley that weekend they go up the

1050
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,650
Sierra Nevadas they strengthen again

1051
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:37,560
they come down the other side

1052
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:41,760
now it's in rain shadow again so it's

1053
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:44,850
super dry over here in Nevada you can

1054
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,160
also see this on a bigger scale so if we

1055
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:49,710
extend this map up into Canada and

1056
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,760
northern territories here's this blue

1057
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:55,920
stripe this is the wet west coast and so

1058
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,600
even up here in Canada with it you know

1059
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,130
this is all mid-latitude cyclones

1060
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,560
they're coming in they're dumping

1061
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:04,740
precipitation along the west coast here

1062
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,630
and then as they move inland they it's

1063
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:10,260
drier you get that rain shadow effect

1064
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:14,100
and they have a very dry inland part of

1065
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:17,310
the continent Oh another thing this

1066
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:20,010
shows is that you can see where the

1067
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:23,400
mid-latitude cyclones kind of stop so

1068
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:25,590
during our summer mid-latitude cyclones

1069
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,970
are coming across up here you know we're

1070
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,460
not aware of them that's why we call

1071
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:32,190
them winter storms but they're still

1072
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:36,230
hammering the coast up here and then in

1073
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:39,900
in our winter there they come down and

1074
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:42,710
get down into right about the middle of

1075
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,700
california that blue color disappears so

1076
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:49,560
mid-latitude cyclones are rarer and

1077
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:51,870
rarer the further south that you go okay

1078
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,090
let's see here so let's look at a map of

1079
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:56,370
just New Mexico for for a minute and you

1080
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:58,020
can see that so there's the outline of

1081
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:00,750
the state right you can kind of make it

1082
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,390
out there and there's Albuquerque where

1083
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:05,910
the X and you'll notice that Albuquerque

1084
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:07,350
is really in almost a driest part of the

1085
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,750
state there's a little bit something dry

1086
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:13,080
right there but really this color this

1087
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:15,900
orange color here it's among the driest

1088
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,360
parts of the state so if you go in any

1089
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:21,630
direction you'll run into parts of New

1090
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,560
Mexico that are that are wetter okay so

1091
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,660
why is this

1092
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,670
well I'm gonna throw up another map here

1093
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,340
of elevation and we can compare these

1094
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,690
two things so Albuquerque is right in

1095
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,970
here and this is the Rio Grande Valley

1096
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:35,310
right it comes down through here and the

1097
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:38,280
river is at the lowest elevation locally

1098
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:41,340
so we live in a spot that's among the

1099
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:43,320
lowest elevation in the state so if

1100
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,750
you're a storm coming from the West you

1101
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,700
gotta go downhill to get to Albuquerque

1102
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:50,010
which means you're weakening as you go

1103
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,810
downhill if your storm coming from the

1104
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:54,180
north you're weakening as you go

1105
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:55,830
downhill coming from the east or the

1106
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:58,140
Northeast weakening as you come downhill

1107
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,740
so no matter which direction a storm

1108
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,930
comes

1109
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,730
unless it's coming directly from the

1110
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,740
south it's got to go downhill to get to

1111
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:07,710
Albuquerque so it weakens as it

1112
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,120
approaches us so this is what happens

1113
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:10,380
all the time you may have had this

1114
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,270
experience we have a winter storm

1115
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,040
warning for example here I go boy maybe

1116
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:17,220
it's gonna snow we'll have a snow day

1117
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,020
tomorrow no school and you wake up in

1118
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,850
the morning all excited and you look

1119
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:23,790
around you see snow everywhere around us

1120
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:26,880
but not here in Albuquerque why because

1121
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:28,860
we are at locally a pretty low elevation

1122
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,670
so that storm that may have dumped snow

1123
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:34,230
all around us weakened as it approached

1124
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:36,990
Albuquerque and you can see on this map

1125
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:39,240
also that this the Rio Grande Valley

1126
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:40,800
comes down this way so all of this is

1127
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:45,210
really dry cuz it's a little elevation

1128
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:47,940
and this blog right here right this is

1129
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:50,400
pretty wet because this corresponds to

1130
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,650
this mountain this little wet blog here

1131
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,270
corresponds to this mountain this will

1132
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,900
the what you know this wet blog right

1133
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,540
there

1134
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,910
corresponds to this mountain etc so

1135
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:02,220
places that are a high elevation get

1136
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:05,220
more precipitation for his storms are

1137
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,780
forced up over them which enhances the

1138
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:10,170
precipitation then they come down the

1139
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:13,140
other side and they're dry again so

1140
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:15,420
let's return back to this map and talk

1141
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,730
about a couple more things so you talk

1142
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:20,610
about rain shadow effect here this is

1143
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:23,310
pretty dry down here and there's more

1144
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:25,050
than one reason for that we do have lack

1145
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:27,270
of mid-latitude cyclones they don't get

1146
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:29,040
that far south we have rain shadow

1147
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,200
effects so the ones that actually get

1148
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,990
this far south lose their moisture on

1149
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,520
the coast but we also have the fact that

1150
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,059
we are under the influence of the

1151
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,099
Pacific

1152
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:40,499
subtropical high Pacific subtropical

1153
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:43,079
high sits right out here out in the

1154
00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:45,089
ocean in influences this part of the

1155
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,759
country kind of right in here Southern

1156
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:50,640
California parts of Nevada Arizona and

1157
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:53,729
New Mexico so the all those things

1158
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,150
combine to make to give us a very dry

1159
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:58,140
climate notice something weird happens

1160
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,539
kind of right in the middle of the

1161
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,890
country if we're a mid latitude cycle

1162
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:03,989
and we're coming in and we dump our

1163
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,789
precipitation on the west coast on the

1164
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:07,170
mountain ranges and then we have that

1165
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:09,559
rain shower to effect and it's pretty

1166
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:13,709
dry then we come down out of the Rockies

1167
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:16,259
then it picks up moisture and we see an

1168
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:18,119
increase of precipitation and how could

1169
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:19,920
that be well if you're mid latitude

1170
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:21,900
cycle and coming across you've lost all

1171
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,089
of your moisture as he came across here

1172
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,369
if you think of it in terms of like dew

1173
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:28,499
point of the air the dew point of the

1174
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:30,689
air was the highest when it started and

1175
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:32,249
you've lost water you've lost water

1176
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:34,380
you've lost water all the way across so

1177
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:36,869
you've got really low remaining dew

1178
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,939
points when you get to here but if

1179
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:40,559
you're a low pressure system and you

1180
00:54:38,939 --> 00:54:43,229
moved let's say into this part of the

1181
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,339
state that part of the country if you're

1182
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:46,380
a little pressure that means you got

1183
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:48,839
counterclockwise rotation going around

1184
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:51,170
here right so that means you can bring

1185
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:56,279
up moisture say from the Gulf of Mexico

1186
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:58,890
bring it in and we figure eight your

1187
00:54:56,279 --> 00:55:00,239
mid-latitude cyclone so mid-latitude

1188
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,549
cyclone that's kind of all out of

1189
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,559
moisture can pick up new moisture maybe

1190
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:06,559
out of the Gulf of Mexico maybe from the

1191
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,660
Atlantic and generate new precipitation

1192
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,630
so that's why we see this half of the

1193
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:14,819
country suddenly much wetter than the

1194
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:16,410
western half of the country mid-latitude

1195
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:17,939
cyclones can come in from many different

1196
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:20,249
directions and we're not getting that

1197
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:21,779
deep into it in this class they may come

1198
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:24,239
down from the Northeast called a

1199
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:27,719
nor'easter they may kind of drop in this

1200
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:29,849
direction but they've got many moisture

1201
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:33,059
sources out here that they can pick up

1202
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:34,829
moisture from so overall there's a lot

1203
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:36,989
more moisture that can generate a lot

1204
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:39,329
more precipitation both in the winter

1205
00:55:36,989 --> 00:55:40,949
and the summer in the winter with

1206
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:43,079
latitude cyclones in the summer

1207
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:45,140
summertime thunderstorms they can pick

1208
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:48,839
up all that high humidity air down here

1209
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,950
we talked about the Tornado Alley that

1210
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:52,410
really unstable

1211
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,260
forming this part of the country in a

1212
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,720
lot of summertime thunderstorms

1213
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,060
so to summarize near the equator we've

1214
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,650
got easterly winds there's some north of

1215
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,570
the Equator there's some south of the

1216
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,700
equator but they're on the collision

1217
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,190
course usually and when they collide

1218
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:10,380
they have the wind has nowhere to go but

1219
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:12,570
up when it goes up it makes a

1220
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,980
cumulonimbus cloud when the wind get

1221
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,200
when the air gets to the top of the key

1222
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,180
Melendez cloud he has nowhere to go I

1223
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,579
can't go in the stratosphere so it goes

1224
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:22,470
north and south and it spreads out along

1225
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:25,290
the globe until it gets to about 30

1226
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:28,440
degrees north and 30 degrees south then

1227
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:30,119
at that point it sinks back down to the

1228
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,579
ground down to the surface of the earth

1229
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,500
that makes high pressure we call those

1230
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:37,020
high pressure areas subtropical highs

1231
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,440
that whole loop rising at the equator

1232
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,670
moving 30 degrees coming back down

1233
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,190
returning back to the equator eventually

1234
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,920
that's called the Headlee cell now all

1235
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:49,109
the winds north of the subtropical highs

1236
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,240
are mostly coming out of the West the

1237
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:52,950
West release most of the winds south of

1238
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,450
the subtropical highs are normally

1239
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:57,990
coming out of the east the easterlies

1240
00:56:54,450 --> 00:57:00,300
but it's not as simple as it is shown in

1241
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:02,670
a lot of textbooks these winds are

1242
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:06,060
changing all the time they're loopy they

1243
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:08,040
have bends so the exact position and

1244
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:11,579
direction of these winds changes day to

1245
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,500
day in a previous lecture we talked to

1246
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:15,990
all about the polar front and how we get

1247
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,510
mid-latitude cyclones those are always

1248
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:20,250
circling the planet all times of the

1249
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,869
year there's some in the northern

1250
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,869
hemisphere there's some in the southern

1251
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:27,300
southern hemisphere now all of these

1252
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:30,480
things that we've talked about create

1253
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,240
different zones of climate we expect

1254
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,420
certain types of weather on a normal

1255
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:39,240
basis what is causing all these things

1256
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,800
ultimately is the fact that the equator

1257
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,319
is warmer than the poles and the earth

1258
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,470
is trying to equilibrate is temperature

1259
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:48,210
but you can also get other small-scale

1260
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:51,050
things that affect your climate and the

1261
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:53,670
one that we've talked about here is the

1262
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:55,800
effect that topography has on

1263
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,150
precipitation so if you live in one side

1264
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,160
of the mountain it could be a whole lot

1265
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,450
wetter they need if you live on the

1266
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,099
other side of the mountain that's called

1267
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:04,390
