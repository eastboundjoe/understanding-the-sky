1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,780
hey this is Mel strong and in this

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,500
lecture we're going to talk about

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,960
seasonal changes that occur in Earth's

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,210
atmospheric circulation pattern so we're

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,100
making the transition from weather to

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,720
climate and we haven't really talked

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,010
about the difference between weather and

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,890
climate yet so we're going to start with

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,260
that so weather is what we've been

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,150
talking about so far in this class is

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,769
what's happening right now in the

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,460
atmosphere it's the current conditions

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,460
okay

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,530
now weather turns out you can't really

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,170
predict it more than about five days out

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,700
and we probably never will and the

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,030
reason for that is something called

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,500
chaos that's in the atmosphere now chaos

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,000
is a mathematical thing but you can kind

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,730
of think of it as if you have a system

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,789
is so complicated that there are too

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,690
many variables we call those degrees of

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,199
freedom and all these extra degrees of

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,049
freedom mean that you can't really make

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,640
predictions very far out in time so what

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,650
will happen is a very small change

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,350
somewhere in the atmosphere can

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,250
propagate to a much bigger change that's

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,360
unforeseeable a few days in the future

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,150
mathematically is a pretty complicated

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,890
thing but you can kind of get a sense of

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,689
it with this movie that we saw before so

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,330
this is water vapor in the atmosphere

34
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,270
and in the bright white are clouds and

35
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,369
so we so if you just if I took a

36
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,650
freeze-frame of this right and I asked

37
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,270
you okay based on all the swirls and

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,869
everything you see what would this look

39
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,750
like say five days in the future it's

40
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,060
nearly impossible to do okay there are

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,570
so much going on here there's a lot of

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,899
chaos and so that means it's really

43
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,790
impossible to predict out more than five

44
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:59,579
days some outlets let's just say oh I

45
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,170
don't know The Weather Channel will

46
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,619
claim that they can make predictions

47
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,719
beyond what they do a 10-day forecast

48
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,129
but if you keep track of how well

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,649
they're doing and their ten-day forecast

50
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,330
is actually pretty bad okay

51
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:19,440
so realistically five maybe seven days

52
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:21,570
so that's weather climate climate really

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,460
refers to the average conditions for a

54
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,420
given place at a given time so in other

55
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,390
words we might say okay what high

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,970
temperature do we expect in Albuquerque

57
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,710
on July 1st so the answer to that we

58
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,930
would go back to all the July firsts

59
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,450
that we have on record in average the

60
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,860
high temperatures okay that's climate

61
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,450
and it can include all kinds of things

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,980
the high temperature the low temperature

63
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,320
the average temperature the

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,300
precipitation the dew point is a lot of

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,989
things that we can include in climate

66
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,290
now the weird thing is that climate is

67
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,209
actually predictable for decades out so

68
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,390
it would be impossible for us to say

69
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,760
exactly what's going to happen

70
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,770
September 15th of next year in terms of

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,580
the weather we just can't do that that's

72
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,930
impossible

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,720
but what we can do is we can say say 10

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,530
years or 20 years in the future what

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,680
will a average September month be like

76
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,560
how will it be compared to an average

77
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,720
September this year right that's the

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,019
kind of thing that we're that we do with

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,650
climate so how is this possible

80
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:35,360
well there's one little analogy I do

81
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:39,890
that might help imagine if you have a

82
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,709
cigarette and the cigarettes burning and

83
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,769
it has all these wispy curls of smoke

84
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,560
that come up alright and I take a

85
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,600
picture of that and I say okay tell me

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,690
exactly where that all these little

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,660
smoke particles are going to be in five

88
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,910
seconds from now okay that would be very

89
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,330
hard to do there's too many degrees of

90
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,450
freedoms too much chaos in this system

91
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:10,380
that's whether climate would be okay now

92
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,049
we're going to take our cigarette and my

93
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,530
question is where do you expect the

94
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:19,470
smoke to be say five seconds from now

95
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:23,820
and climate would say well all the smoke

96
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:26,880
is going to be contained in this volume

97
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,510
right there that's sort of the

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,130
difference between

99
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,080
in climate weather is concerned about

100
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,360
where are the individual particles of

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,550
smoke going to be climate is concerned

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,190
with well where is all the smoke gun to

103
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,410
be contained sometimes we were referred

104
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,300
to this as the boundary conditions so

105
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,670
for any given place there are

106
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,680
limitations I can only get so hot and

107
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,810
only gets so cold there's only a certain

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,240
amount of water vapor you expect in the

109
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,440
air these are the boundary conditions

110
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,500
and they're set by all kinds of things

111
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,750
like the atmospheric chemistry and the

112
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,280
tilt of the Earth's axis and what the

113
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,970
Sun is doing all these different things

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,620
okay so that's climate you can actually

115
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,170
make a better prediction for climate

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:13,140
decades out then you can with weather

117
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:16,650
more than about a week out there's

118
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,600
another term that you will sometimes

119
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,770
hear called a climate normal or

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,040
sometimes we just say a climate norm

121
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,080
climate normal is climate data for a

122
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,630
thirty-year period and it came about

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,270
because a long time ago there's a bunch

124
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,070
of scientists at the weather meeting and

125
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,020
really reliable weather stations had

126
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,810
only been around for about 30 years and

127
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,780
so they decided to use a 30-year chunk

128
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,520
of time to represent climate and every

129
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,430
so many years they redefined that

130
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,410
30-year chunk so sometimes when you look

131
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,320
up climate conditions for a certain

132
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,300
place like back to my example what's the

133
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,700
average high temperature for July 1st in

134
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,140
Albuquerque it usually the number you

135
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,350
might find if you look something like

136
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,720
that up will come from a 30-year chunk

137
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:09,300
of time called a climate normal okay so

138
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:13,500
we'll see these in this class okay first

139
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,020
things first why do we have seasons so

140
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,930
if you ask a lot of people including

141
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,870
college graduates why is it warmer in

142
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,700
the summer and colder in the winter the

143
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,220
most common wrong answer that you will

144
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,250
get is that the earth is closer to the

145
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,910
Sun in the summer and farther from the

146
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,790
Sun in the winter and kids believe this

147
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,250
Adil's believe this Yale graduates

148
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,340
believe this okay so let's just go over

149
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,580
this first the reason we have seasons is

150
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:48,810
because the earth is on a tilted axis

151
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:51,620
now this orbit looks like an ellipse but

152
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:56,699
it's actually pretty close to a circle

153
00:06:51,620 --> 00:07:00,270
now if we move around the Sun okay with

154
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,540
time so let's say here here I am in June

155
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,729
and what you can see is that if you

156
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:09,180
lived up above this little red circle

157
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:11,550
the Arctic Circle that you are in Sun 24

158
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,889
hours a day right and if you have

159
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,630
somewhere down here you have part of

160
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,850
your day of Sun part of your day as

161
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,250
night and if you're down here which we

162
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,600
can't see right now they're in the dark

163
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,250
24 hours a day so I'm gonna show that

164
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,470
okay this is just another view of the

165
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,580
same thing here's these guys down here

166
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,919
in Antarctica

167
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,800
they'd aren't seeing any Sun whatsoever

168
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,380
right so right now the northern

169
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,350
hemisphere is getting more Sun southern

170
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,880
hemisphere is getting less Sun okay so

171
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:47,430
it's our summer and it's their winter

172
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:52,260
all right so if we travel forward in

173
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:56,250
time we come around and as we go around

174
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,760
the Sun we're maintaining this tilted

175
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:02,700
angle right the angle of rotation of the

176
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,130
earth and Earth's axis it's not exactly

177
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,280
perpendicular to the plane there the

178
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:11,430
orbits it's tilted a little bit about 23

179
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,450
degrees and that's why this is happening

180
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:19,110
so I come over here now we're in the

181
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,930
we're in the winter our winter and you

182
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,510
can see that the guys that are in the

183
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:27,870
Arctic Circle and any for any place

184
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:30,539
north of that are in the dark 24 hours a

185
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,419
day and if we can see what our friends

186
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:37,740
in Antarctica are doing they are in the

187
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:41,159
Sun 24 hours a day so our winter their

188
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,950
summer okay but it's not the distance

189
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,779
right the distant fact in the northern

190
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,600
hemisphere our summer were actually

191
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,610
farthest from the Sun in the summer and

192
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,900
we're actually closest to the Sun in the

193
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:56,160
winter for us in the northern hemisphere

194
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,550
alright so with that let's talk about

195
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,860
what the seasons actually do as a result

196
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:06,240
of this tilted Earth's axis business we

197
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,310
alternate between heating the Northern

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,830
Hemisphere and and then heating the

199
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:14,340
southern hemisphere right so here's a

200
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,530
little animation it says net shortwave

201
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,350
radiation that's a kind of a fancy way

202
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,490
of just saying sunlight so just imagine

203
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,040
that this is showing you how much

204
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,800
sunlight hits the ground as the months

205
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,400
go by okay and you see there's this band

206
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,460
of dark red which is the most intense

207
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:36,300
sunlight and it migrates north and it

208
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,820
migrated south with the seasons now it's

209
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,500
not a perfect band it's kind of spotty

210
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,590
because it also takes into account

211
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,350
clouds so this is how much radiation

212
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,300
actually hits the surface which if

213
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,890
there's a lot of clouds it will reflect

214
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,320
some of that so that's why it's not a

215
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,920
perfect band but a couple things to

216
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,310
think about here first of all when we're

217
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,020
in we have the winter up here right they

218
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,940
have the summer down there paid

219
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,540
hopefully you know that but some people

220
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,020
don't what would life be like if you

221
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,240
lived right out here say where my dot is

222
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,910
right now so this would be kind of weird

223
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,880
because the red band passes you over

224
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,890
there and you have summer and then it

225
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,250
comes back down and passes you again and

226
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:26,910
you have summer again so if you lived

227
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,700
along the ITCZ that area you actually

228
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,380
would have two summers you don't really

229
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,710
have anything you could consider winter

230
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,500
or even seasons for that matter but you

231
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:44,010
have two extra hot periods of the year

232
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:46,200
if you live near the equator well if the

233
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,270
earth was all the same thing

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,300
then the patterns of temperature would

235
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,950
kind of follow that last animation but

236
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,350
it's not all the same thing

237
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,570
and so this what we're looking at here

238
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,230
is air temperature again throughout the

239
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:04,290
months and you can see that there's a

240
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,930
band here of high air temperatures and

241
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,390
then you can see the the

242
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,860
we purple colors are the cold

243
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:15,060
temperatures so a couple things of

244
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:18,540
notice when it becomes the winter say

245
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,390
our winter the continents cool off much

246
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,700
quicker than the oceans right so you can

247
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,010
see that and in the summer the

248
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,980
continents heat up faster than the

249
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:32,070
oceans so we talk about sometimes this

250
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,860
term heat capacity that it takes a lot

251
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,480
of energy to heat up water and then once

252
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,029
water is warm it takes a long time for

253
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,950
it to cool off whereas soil heats up

254
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,380
pretty quickly cools off pretty quickly

255
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,750
so the temperatures of the continents

256
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,750
change much more rapidly than the

257
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:51,000
temperatures of the oceans so that's one

258
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,370
thing to notice another thing to notice

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,750
is that the really if we're thinking

260
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:59,430
about the ITCZ so again this is a

261
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,660
continuation of the last lecture so if

262
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,950
you didn't watch the last one go back

263
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,240
and do that first or nothing is going to

264
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:10,440
make sense here the ITCZ follows the

265
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,420
hottest part of the earth okay but the

266
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,300
hottest part of the earth is moving

267
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,370
great so if you imagine kind of right in

268
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,470
the middle of this orange blob kind of

269
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:24,300
right up in North Africa down here right

270
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:27,570
so as you watch this the ITCZ is going

271
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,720
to follow the hottest part of the earth

272
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:36,570
so it's also moving with this orange

273
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:39,959
blob here so as the seasons change the

274
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,330
location of the ITCZ changes well

275
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,330
remember at the ITCZ that's where it

276
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,880
rises okay well if you change where air

277
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,300
rises then you're also going to change

278
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,490
where the air comes and sinks back down

279
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,440
so what's not shown here but we'll see

280
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,020
in a second is locations of the

281
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,620
subtropical highs also change with the

282
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,980
seasons

283
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,420
so what we're getting into is a pattern

284
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,800
you know many patterns here they're

285
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,180
going to be shifting with the seasons

286
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,430
the ITCZ

287
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,700
the heavily cells subtropical highs

288
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,470
polar fronts easterlies westerlies all

289
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,950
that all that stuff it's all going to

290
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,480
shift with the seasons as we

291
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,080
alternatively warm in cool different

292
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,140
parts of the earth

293
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,540
okay so here is an animation that kind

294
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,670
of shows how some of these things change

295
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,620
with the seasons so right now I've got

296
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,589
time slider down here and it's said

297
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,769
early January and I can see that the

298
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:38,079
ITCZ is this purple line right here and

299
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:41,410
the first thing you'll notice is that

300
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,880
it's actually not a straight line and if

301
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,310
you remember from the previous lecture

302
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,220
we looked at some diagrams from a

303
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,829
textbook that showed the ITCZ is as nice

304
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,720
perfectly straight line usually right at

305
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:54,310
the equator and we see that you know it

306
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,149
hits the equator a couple of places here

307
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:01,209
but it's not at the equator so right now

308
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:02,980
we're in the winter and so the winter is

309
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,320
heating up the southern hemisphere more

310
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,720
which means that these continents down

311
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,360
here are heating up more which means

312
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,209
that the warmest part of the earth is

313
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,670
kind of near the equator but right now

314
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:17,860
South America is is warming up quite a

315
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,360
bit because it's their summer so you see

316
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,490
it dip down to the south a little bit

317
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,820
then returns close to the equator then

318
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:27,370
again Africa is warming up because it's

319
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,100
it's summer and it dips down again and

320
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,990
then it gets into some really warm ocean

321
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,620
water which we'll talk about probably in

322
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,420
a couple of lectures now here it shows

323
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,399
the Hadley cells this is where the air

324
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,350
is rising and you can see they show the

325
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,750
air moving to the north and the south

326
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,450
and sinking down about 30 degrees north

327
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,459
30 degrees south and of course that

328
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,230
travels all the way across you know the

329
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,839
world right so this is going all the way

330
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,899
around the planet they also show in here

331
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,370
the polar front now this is kind of a

332
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,100
weird way to show it because the polar

333
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,110
front itself is a wavy line kind of like

334
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,870
the Purple Line and it would be coming

335
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,279
along kind of through here right and it

336
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,140
changes day to day right it's always

337
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:12,459
changing though with a bunch of these

338
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:15,279
rows be waves okay so I'm going to move

339
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:18,279
forward in time and so as I do so we're

340
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,310
getting into our spring and then we're

341
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,459
getting into our summer and you notice

342
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,320
how this whole thing is migrating

343
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,110
northwards right and as it migrates

344
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,760
northwards the Hadley cells also migrate

345
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,310
northwards and polar front migrates more

346
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,250
northwards so I continue to move this oh

347
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,290
we just got past summer they were going

348
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,800
to get into fall and you'll see the ITCZ

349
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,630
who is back down down meaning south

350
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:52,209
right okay so this is how the ITCZ

351
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:54,459
changes with the seasons and heavily

352
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:56,459
sells change with it which means that

353
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,510
we're that air is coming down right here

354
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:01,000
that's where that subtropical high is

355
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,430
gonna be it's also going to change so I

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,949
want to show pressure that's what that

357
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,930
button does okay so let's see if we can

358
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:10,870
figure out what's happening here so I'm

359
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,269
gonna go back to January and we've got

360
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,060
our subtropical highs there's a strong

361
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:18,550
one right there one right there one

362
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,810
right there about 30 degrees right more

363
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,839
or less 30 degrees

364
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,360
then we've got some over here and here

365
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,880
those are about 30 degrees we also have

366
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,410
some highs if you remember back when we

367
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,610
talked about air pressure we said that

368
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,010
you could get a high pressure if you

369
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,209
have just really cold air that's what's

370
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,800
happening here

371
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:38,620
so our friends over here in Siberia

372
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,720
which are very cold they're experiencing

373
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,260
some high pressure just from a big pool

374
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,630
of cold air as our friends in the

375
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,149
northern territories up here in Canada

376
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:52,959
very cold air makes a high pressure for

377
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:55,630
a totally different reason also we can

378
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,970
see lows here and here these are places

379
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,100
where mid-latitude cyclones often form

380
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,480
we didn't talk about this when we talked

381
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,980
about mid-latitude cyclones but there's

382
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,449
certain places on earth where they

383
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,910
happen to form over and over the

384
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,040
conditions are just right and this is

385
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,750
referred to as the Aleutian low it's a

386
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,280
so these are the Aleutian Islands and

387
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,740
it's just a place where these mid

388
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,150
latitudes start to spin up and we talked

389
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,630
about the stages that they go through

390
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:23,199
well they start here so it's low because

391
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,120
on average this is where you often get

392
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,860
the warm fronts and the cold fronts over

393
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,510
and over and over and over right you can

394
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,360
give them other places but if you

395
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,950
average it out over many years you would

396
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,750
see it kind of there's a low pressure

397
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,660
that kind of hangs out over here and one

398
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,910
over here okay also one other thing

399
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,940
looks like we have a thermal glow right

400
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:45,600
here so it's super hot in Africa hot air

401
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,230
rises so they put a low well here okay

402
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,150
notice

403
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,880
this one this is the Pacific subtropical

404
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,220
high oK we've talked about this last

405
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,870
time it's sitting out here in the ocean

406
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,260
I'm going to go forward in a time and

407
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:02,500
notice what it in particular does so as

408
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,910
we go forward in time our lows that we

409
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,730
had up here from the mid-latitude

410
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,290
cyclones are going away there's still

411
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,640
mid-latitude cyclones but they're

412
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,860
they're pretty weak and they're really

413
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,950
far to the north but notice what's

414
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,960
happened to our Pacific subtropical high

415
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,840
it's getting bigger which means it's

416
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,410
getting stronger but it's also moving

417
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,559
away from the continent okay so here we

418
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,990
are in in July and we see it's kind of

419
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,340
parked out here over the Pacific and

420
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:39,669
it's big right let me go back I go back

421
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:44,160
in our winter it's smaller but it's

422
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:47,350
actually much closer to us me New Mexico

423
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:52,450
Southern California Arizona much closer

424
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:54,220
to that area and in the summer he gets

425
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,740
bigger but it kind of moves further

426
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,830
offshore okay so this is important

427
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:02,290
because what we're leading up to is

428
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,510
we're trying to explain weather patterns

429
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,880
climate patterns that we see in the

430
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,880
United States so one of the climate

431
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,160
patterns that we see in New Mexico and

432
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,460
in Arizona and in Southern California is

433
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,070
that we have pretty dry winters right in

434
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,929
New Mexico most of our precipitation

435
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,660
falls in the monsoon season in the

436
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,130
summer and then the other half of it is

437
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,530
scattered throughout the year so we have

438
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,270
pretty dry

439
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,580
January's pretty JA dried December is

440
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,860
pretty dry February's and that's because

441
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,260
this Pacific subtropical high is just

442
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,929
sitting right up there really close to

443
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,450
us so even though it's weaker it's

444
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:43,390
closer and we if we feel the effects of

445
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:46,030
that Pacific subtropical high now in the

446
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,179
summer it gets bigger it gets stronger

447
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:52,780
and it but it moves further away from us

448
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,460
so we get a relief from the Pacific

449
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,380
subtropical high and that is one of the

450
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,409
things that allows our monsoon to

451
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,180
actually kick in and start producing

452
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:03,310
precipitation but

453
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,250
not to clear on this but it actually is

454
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,220
closer to the west coast up here like

455
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:12,040
California Oregon and Washington State

456
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,410
so their summers are actually going to

457
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,660
be really really dry because of the

458
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,730
specific subtropical high it's it's out

459
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,860
there right off the coast and they are

460
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,950
under the influence of sinking air day

461
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,740
after day after day so we can see this

462
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,420
on earth nil Schoolnet and you can

463
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,250
actually change the date and look at

464
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,190
different times in the past so what I've

465
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,550
done here is I've loaded up a day that's

466
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,350
in January and we're looking at surface

467
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:44,470
winds and I'm actually going to change

468
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:50,740
the overlay to MSL P 4 means sea level

469
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:53,140
pressure and right there spiraling off

470
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,480
the west coast so there is California

471
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,390
there's roughly the international border

472
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,540
and there's the Pacific subtropical high

473
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,490
it's spiraling around really pretty

474
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,720
close to where we live right and you can

475
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,970
see the winds coming right down the

476
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,190
coast here now I'm gonna I'm gonna

477
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:15,400
change I'm gonna go one day further now

478
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,320
you can see it's even closer right so

479
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,630
that would mean even more sinking air

480
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,320
kind of in this region one day there it

481
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,690
is again

482
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,520
so as I go day to day you'll see it

483
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,050
moves around a little bit but it's

484
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,550
pretty much just staying in this one

485
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:35,050
spot producing sinking air and that

486
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,120
seeking air is gonna fight cloud

487
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,000
formation and we have clear skies for

488
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,250
most of the days of the winter now

489
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,690
before we change the season let me just

490
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,460
point out that these are mid-latitude

491
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,500
cyclones that's what these guys are

492
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,330
right so those guys are going to come

493
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,480
ashore and they're going to slam into

494
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,430
the west coast north of the Pacific

495
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,750
subtropical high so you can kind of

496
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,780
think of it like the Pacific subtropical

497
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,580
high is kind of blocking the storms from

498
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,070
coming in and sometimes they'll talk

499
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,350
about that in in weather reports that

500
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,940
the high has blocking the low it's not

501
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,090
quite how it works but you can think of

502
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:13,360
it that way okay so now let's change

503
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,680
from a winter day to a summer day okay

504
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,830
so same thing I'm

505
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:22,630
going to change to see the level

506
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:25,480
pressure and now that big white blog

507
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,250
there is the Pacific subtropical high so

508
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,450
here we are down here notice how much

509
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,610
bigger it is zoom in a little bit so by

510
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,250
comparison the one we saw last time was

511
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,130
kind of like about that big this thing

512
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,930
is giant and so we saw that in the

513
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,380
animation that the Pacific Pacific

514
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,630
subtropical high gets larger in the

515
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,940
summer in our summer and it moves out

516
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:52,240
into the Pacific Ocean away from arc

517
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,910
where we live kind of far from the coast

518
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,130
but notice that these winds are coming

519
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:00,730
right down the west coast right here

520
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,890
alright so we are farther from it than

521
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,650
we were in the winter but these guys are

522
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:08,170
actually under a pretty strong influence

523
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,750
of the Pacific subtropical high so

524
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:14,040
they're getting sinking air all the way

525
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:16,660
up and down the coast so we call this

526
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,370
Mediterranean climate Mediterranean

527
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,890
climate name from the Mediterranean Sea

528
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,280
is a place where you typically have wet

529
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,770
winters and dry summers west coast of

530
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,450
the United States super dry summers if

531
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,970
you look at say rain records for like

532
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,680
San Francisco I mean there's like 30

533
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,050
year periods with no recorded

534
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,330
precipitation in the summer okay super

535
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:43,000
dry because of the specifics of tropical

536
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:45,340
high so if the ITCZ is moving and the

537
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,710
Headlee cells are moving and subtropical

538
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,930
hinds are moving and the polar fronts

539
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,730
are moving what we get are moving

540
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,190
patterns of precipitation throughout the

541
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:58,090
year so this animation is showing

542
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:59,950
monthly averages of precipitation so

543
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,480
what they what they've done is for each

544
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,530
one of these months they've gone back 30

545
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,600
years and looked at all the

546
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,790
precipitation that fell around the world

547
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,170
and plotted it and as you might expect

548
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:12,100
the darker blue colors mean more

549
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:16,030
precipitation so this one is in

550
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:20,170
millimeters so dark blue 400 millimeters

551
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:22,060
of precipitation for that month now one

552
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,060
of the things that you notice at first

553
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,780
is that you've got this dark blue right

554
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,640
through here

555
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:31,030
that's the

556
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:34,420
zone of most precipitation is following

557
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:36,250
pretty closely the ITCZ so as the ITCZ

558
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,290
migrates north and south

559
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,620
this blue stripe migrates north and

560
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,540
south with it okay so a lot of rain is

561
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,690
falling along the ITCZ they have these

562
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,820
gigantic cumulonimbus every day the

563
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,190
other thing you might notice is that we

564
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:55,000
have these white areas and white means

565
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,280
no precipitation so if we remember from

566
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,240
last lecture we talked about how the

567
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,620
subtropical highs in theory would form a

568
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,080
stripe all the way around you know a

569
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,610
band all the way around the earth if the

570
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,680
earth was all the same thing I could

571
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:11,500
pose all water but the fact that you

572
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,330
have continents breaks that up and you

573
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,820
can see that here so here's a

574
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,450
subtropical high here's a subtropical

575
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,000
high here's a subtropical high and in

576
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,390
between there are some wet zones right

577
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,100
so it doesn't really form this this

578
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,680
continuous band because of the

579
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,170
continents kind of miss this up but you

580
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,940
can definitely see the effect of the

581
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,700
subtropical highest these are areas

582
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:41,650
where it literally may not rain for

583
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,680
weeks and weeks at a time now this one

584
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,540
in particular is the one that we are

585
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,660
interested in this is the Pacific

586
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:52,780
subtropical high so notice that it grows

587
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:56,140
into the summer and then it shrinks

588
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,420
again in the winter and in migrants

589
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,490
north and south a little bit right so we

590
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,950
just saw this but here it is growing out

591
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:05,800
into the summer out into the ocean then

592
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,650
kind of shrinks back point is it's

593
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,750
closer to us in the winter even though

594
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,960
it's smaller another thing you might

595
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,270
notice overall most of the rain falls in

596
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,430
the ocean okay you mean I thought about

597
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,440
that before but there's a lot of white

598
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,390
out here in the continents because once

599
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,030
storms leave the ocean they don't have a

600
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,860
source of moisture so that rain out

601
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,290
effect rain shadow effect all happens

602
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,390
and you see big areas out here in the

603
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,890
continents you know I hear it as in the

604
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:38,140
winter really dry out there remember

605
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,760
cold air dry air so in the winter

606
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,870
evening you might have a really big

607
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,809
storm it doesn't have them

608
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:46,690
much moisture so you see really dry out

609
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:49,930
you know areas up here say in a little

610
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,820
sorry in Canada in Siberia in the winter

611
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:55,300
months it looks pretty white they get

612
00:26:51,820 --> 00:27:00,220
very little precipitation so most of the

613
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:03,160
rainfall falls in the ocean so we're

614
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,650
gonna go through month by month what the

615
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,200
precipitation patterns are like in the

616
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:10,390
United States so each one of these maps

617
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,850
I'm going to show you is a 30 year

618
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,280
normal so again that means we've taken

619
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,559
records for 30 years and we're gonna use

620
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,450
that record to determine the averages

621
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:21,700
the colors represent how much

622
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,090
precipitation fell in this particular

623
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,940
months on this case this is the January

624
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:29,380
so let's look at this and we're going to

625
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,410
concentrate on different areas of the

626
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:35,920
country at a time in let's look at the

627
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:38,290
west coast here so we've got a lot of

628
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,150
precipitation hitting the west coast

629
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,370
those are those mid-latitude cyclones

630
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:45,070
coming in right if you can see once they

631
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,470
pass through now the colors indicate a

632
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,510
lot less precipitation that's our rain

633
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,750
shadow effect and then they pass over

634
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:54,940
here and really dry and we talked about

635
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,260
this last time how they have gone over

636
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,420
these mountains and they go through the

637
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,400
Rockies and then they come down this

638
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,590
eastern slope and there's not much

639
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,130
precipitation left and the air is going

640
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:09,070
downhill and all those things fight

641
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:11,170
storm formation so we also said last

642
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,820
time that once you get a low-pressure

643
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,770
Center out here the mid-latitude

644
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,760
cyclones come through this way they can

645
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,840
pick up more moisture and they're

646
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,000
re-energized and they produce more

647
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,550
precipitation so you see a lot of

648
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,990
precipitation down here also in January

649
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,940
and that's all mostly from these

650
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,770
mid-latitude cyclones that they run out

651
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,260
of gas down here but then they pick it

652
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,420
up again over there also significant

653
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,390
amount of precipitation up here in the

654
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,650
Northeast ok so we see a pattern that's

655
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,410
very similar to that we go to the

656
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,230
February and notice what happens as I

657
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:48,040
move into March and in April I start to

658
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:50,320
see that the wet area is shrinking

659
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,870
towards the north on the west coast and

660
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,830
that's because our mid-latitude cyclones

661
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,419
are

662
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,750
moving further and further to the north

663
00:28:55,419 --> 00:29:01,330
until eventually we get to June and then

664
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:04,029
July and there's basically no

665
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,909
precipitation along the west coast and

666
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:08,529
the other thing that's happening is that

667
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:10,960
Pacific subtropical high that setup shop

668
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:13,990
out here and the sinking air is

669
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,539
providing it for a very dry coast along

670
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:19,269
on the west here

671
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:20,799
ok so let's back up and talk about

672
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:24,610
what's happening in our part of the

673
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:28,049
world so in our part of the world you

674
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:29,950
know we're we're down hid downstream

675
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:32,380
mid-latitude cyclones they come ashore

676
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,639
here and they come and land and maybe

677
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,769
maybe they dumped some more

678
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,630
precipitation but by the time they get

679
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:39,250
to us it's pretty dry right so learn

680
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,429
they're kind of the rainshadow of this

681
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:46,360
whole area and so we have a pretty dry

682
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:48,639
January in February and March in April

683
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,289
and we can see the effects of that

684
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:54,190
Pacific subtropical high keeping this

685
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:57,309
whole area pretty dry and then here we

686
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,110
are in May in the east half of New

687
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:00,730
Mexico is actually starting to get some

688
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:04,389
precipitation because we're starting to

689
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:07,570
set up that unstable air that we call

690
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:10,480
Tornado Alley we've got warm humid air

691
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,279
moving in from that Gulf of Mexico we

692
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,500
occasionally get cold dry air coming

693
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:16,990
down from Canada they mix it up over

694
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,840
here produce lots of thunderstorms we're

695
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,309
seeing that kick off here and eastern

696
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,620
New Mexico is getting a little bit of

697
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:26,980
that now the mountains right through

698
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:30,970
here block that moist air from coming in

699
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:33,100
so this pool of dry air is protected

700
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,490
from this humid air from the mountains

701
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,000
okay so that's May June kind of the same

702
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,519
story

703
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,559
and then boom July something changes

704
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,019
right and what happens is we get our

705
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:45,880
monsoon circulation that's the next

706
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:47,950
lecture ok so I'm gonna just punt on

707
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,919
that for now but we go through our

708
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,590
monsoon season and then the monsoon

709
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:55,539
season kind of comes to an end and we

710
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,970
start to see the rebuilding of that

711
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:01,149
Pacific subtropical high you know the

712
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:05,130
effects the dryness here and then we get

713
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:07,510
into the winter months so we're actually

714
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,880
finally getting into this book

715
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,620
bitte and we're gonna get more into this

716
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,860
book in a couple weeks but we there's a

717
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:18,790
few pages that apply to us now so in the

718
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:21,280
introduction pages 10 and 11 there's a

719
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,020
section here on the difference between

720
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,630
weather and climate okay so we kind of

721
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,150
talked about that they talk about

722
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,310
climate zones and there's a map of the

723
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,500
world the major climate zones of the

724
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:36,700
world so based on everything we've

725
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:39,000
talked about right the ITCZ subtropical

726
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,980
highs but polar front all that stuff

727
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,650
there are zones in the world that have

728
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,060
similar climates and they they get names

729
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,940
if we're into this we're not going to

730
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,800
dig that deep but this map kind of shows

731
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,930
some of the different climate zones that

732
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,170
are set up because of some of the things

733
00:31:52,930 --> 00:32:00,070
we've been talking about on the next

734
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:01,570
page so here they talks about layers of

735
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,270
the atmosphere in composition we talked

736
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,610
about that in the past the last lecture

737
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,440
was on atmospheric circulation there is

738
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:11,020
a section here in the book that has a

739
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,580
break break away view of the

740
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,160
circulations that we were talking about

741
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,810
and some basic principles of circulation

742
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,820
over here so it's a good kind of review

743
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,820
of what we talked about last time

744
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,620
