1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:11,330
a I'm L strong and this lecture is on

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,220
monsoons

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,250
and we're going to start out talking

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:19,850
about a couple of scenarios that will

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,060
lead up to monsoons and first I want you

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,150
to imagine that we've gotten an island

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:29,590
sitting out in the ocean and the ocean

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:33,500
let's say is 17 degrees

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:36,170
now the ocean has a very high heat

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,079
capacity which means it takes a lot of

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,760
energy to warm the ocean up and then

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,940
once the ocean is warm it takes a long

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,700
time for it to cool back down and and so

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,379
most places the ocean temperature is

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,480
pretty much the same day and night it

16
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:53,690
doesn't really change that much so for

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,000
this scenario the ocean is 70 degrees

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:01,309
and it's going to be 70 degrees in the

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,159
day and also at night but the island has

20
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,049
will be a fairly low heat capacity which

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,409
means that it's temperature is going to

22
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:12,289
dramatically change from day to night so

23
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,779
this is the daytime there's the Sun and

24
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:19,159
the Sun comes out and warms the island

25
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:22,969
and let's say he gets up to 80 to 85

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,829
okay so the temperature on the island is

27
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:28,700
warmer than that of the surrounding

28
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:31,849
water and the air starts to rise okay

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,560
the air starts to rise and if we think

30
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:35,869
about what happened when we did this

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,240
with cumuliform clouds of convection

32
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:40,999
let's say maybe we get some sort of

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,020
convective cloud above that the air

34
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:50,090
continues to rise then exits the cloud

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:54,109
right okay so for today the important

36
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,719
point is if you're making air rise off

37
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:58,630
this island there has to be other air

38
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,809
that comes and takes its place

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:07,069
so there has to be air moving in off the

40
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:08,869
ocean to replace the air that's rising

41
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:13,069
off the island so if you're standing

42
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,170
right here in this little picture you

43
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,770
would you would feel the sea breeze this

44
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,460
wind coming in off the ocean

45
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,270
and so you've got one coming in off the

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,650
ocean it rises the air we exits the

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:31,230
cloud and if we could follow it around

48
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:37,020
we would have some kind of convection

49
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:41,370
cell like this okay

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:45,060
so during the day we have air moving in

51
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:49,290
off the ocean moving in land and rising

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,450
above the island okay that's the day now

53
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,630
let's say same scenario but it's the

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,630
night

55
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:05,130
so now let's imagine what happens at

56
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:09,600
night so the Sun has gone down and we'll

57
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:15,150
draw here's the moon let's say and so

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,970
the water is still 70 but our island

59
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,770
because it has a low heat capacity you

60
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,170
know it warmed up quickly in the daytime

61
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:26,940
it's going to cool quickly at night and

62
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:31,680
let's say it cools down to 55 okay so

63
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:35,490
now this colder then the surrounding

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:43,350
ocean so what would happen is you would

65
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:47,550
have air that's rising on either side of

66
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:51,990
the island and there is air that is

67
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:55,970
replacing the rising air coming off of

68
00:03:51,990 --> 00:04:01,410
the island so if you're standing here

69
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:04,980
you feel wind blowing out to sea okay so

70
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:08,100
this might rise and may or may not form

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,070
a cumuliform cloud but we set up a

72
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,900
circulation pattern that's exactly the

73
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,570
opposite of what we had in the daytime

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,920
so in the daytime we had air rising

75
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,430
because it was warmer than the air

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,710
around it at nighttime we have air

77
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,430
sinking over the island and air rising

78
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,460
on the other side of it so the the

79
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:38,520
circulation exactly

80
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:38,520
flipped okay so let's extend this idea

81
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:51,410
except now what I'm going to do is I'm

82
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,410
going to make the ocean and a continent

83
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,270
and now that instead of thinking of day

84
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:04,320
versus night let's think about summer

85
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:10,830
versus winter okay so if it is let's say

86
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:13,290
this is a 70 degree ocean and we have a

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:18,480
cut let's say it's the winter and the

88
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:21,030
continent is let's say 50 okay and this

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,920
is day and night they'll be there's

90
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,510
going to be a 24-hour cycle of

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,120
temperature but let's think about a

92
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,340
season here during this entire winter

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,300
season the continent is going to be

94
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:39,410
colder than the ocean so what'll happen

95
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,410
is air will rise over the warmer ocean

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:49,050
right and then this air over the

97
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,700
continent is going to come out to

98
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,810
replace the air that's rising

99
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:58,020
so again if you're standing here you've

100
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,720
got you experience this breeze coming

101
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,500
off the continent so if we could trace

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,280
this back we would see that there's this

103
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,770
this breeze coming down off the off the

104
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,180
continent out into the ocean and then

105
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:18,210
rising now what is this aerial ear like

106
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,800
well the way I've drawn this we've got

107
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,750
high elevations up here and we know that

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,000
higher you go the colder of the air so

109
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:37,710
this is probably pretty dry and cold and

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,140
as that air comes down the air warms so

111
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,820
sinking air warm so this air coming down

112
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,750
here hill is warming but it's not

113
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:48,450
getting any more moisture there's no

114
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,669
source of moisture so the only thing

115
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,669
that's changing as this comes down as

116
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:55,800
the relative humidity is decreasing so

117
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,300
you're making the air warmer

118
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,699
but the dew point makes the ratio of

119
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,440
staying the same so when you come down

120
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:08,669
here you've got low relative humidity

121
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,319
dry air okay and when I say warm that's

122
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,970
relatively speaking right this could be

123
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,289
this could all be really cold air of

124
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,840
course we said it's 50 degrees that's

125
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:18,150
not that cold but whatever temperature

126
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,190
this is this might be air that's way

127
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,639
below freezing and it's coming down the

128
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,020
continent and as it comes down at warms

129
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,789
doesn't necessarily mean it feels warm

130
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,759
to you it's just getting warmer

131
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,710
but the point is we've got cold dry air

132
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,340
coming down the continent going out to

133
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:40,110
sea okay so this is analogous to what

134
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:44,750
happens in a place like India okay so so

135
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:49,740
my continent here is maybe India and

136
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,250
this part up here are the Himalayan

137
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,530
mountains

138
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,930
so the Himalayan mountains that's that

139
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,169
big mountain chain between India and the

140
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,990
Tibetan Plateau so think of like Mount

141
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:03,090
Everest right you've got Mount Everest

142
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,590
is one mountain in this big chain of

143
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,169
really tall mountains you've got a

144
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:10,889
really you've got really tall mountains

145
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:15,719
up here on the way to Pakistan over here

146
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:22,800
and Tibetan Plateau so this then is

147
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:25,650
Indian Ocean and this is what India

148
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,509
experiences throughout the winter very

149
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,569
very dry conditions they've got air

150
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:32,579
sinking down off the Himalayans coming

151
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:35,010
down across the continent out into the

152
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:39,209
ocean where it then meets relatively

153
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:41,550
warm water and rises all right

154
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:43,409
so let's now think about so remember

155
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:47,459
just to make sure it's clear this is the

156
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:50,550
winter okay this is the winter so we're

157
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,920
gonna do the same scenario in the summer

158
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,760
okay so now I'm gonna draw another one

159
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,760
just like this one

160
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:05,529
and will say for the sake of argument

161
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:12,160
that the ocean is still 70 degrees but

162
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:15,399
now it is the summer and the continent

163
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,800
warms up more than the ocean so again

164
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,930
there's a there's a day/night cycle but

165
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,430
overall the continent is staying warmer

166
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,389
than the oceans so let's just say for

167
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:30,279
the sake of argument that it's a tea

168
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:35,009
over here okay so now we've got air

169
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:41,499
that's rising above the continent and

170
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:42,149
that is going to pull in air from the

171
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,709
ocean

172
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,019
now what's the air like that's over the

173
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:52,569
ocean well this is a pretty warm ocean

174
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:53,920
so this is high dewpoint air right so

175
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:55,899
back when we talked about the vaporators

176
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,930
you got warm body water you got a lot of

177
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:01,300
evaporation this is very humid air and

178
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,699
now you're you're pulling it over the

179
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,949
continent where the continent is warmer

180
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:11,259
than the ocean so you're gonna have

181
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:13,509
rising booms of air that lead to

182
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,279
thunderstorms and you're going to have

183
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:17,170
them all up and down I'm just drawing

184
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:23,379
this them in one spot but you're gonna

185
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:25,720
have this more and more as you go up the

186
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:28,660
continent so in fact you get all the way

187
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,249
up here remember this is the Himalayan

188
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,740
mountains up here Mount Everest all that

189
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:38,589
good stuff and as air rises up over

190
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,040
those mountains they're gonna make some

191
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:45,009
really extremely convective

192
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:50,790
thunderstorms up here right so as air

193
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,790
rises say above the Himalayan mountains

194
00:10:51,269 --> 00:11:00,839
that's going to help pull this warm

195
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:03,189
humid air up over the continent so and

196
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,139
just to be clear you'd have rising air

197
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:08,019
on all these I'm just trying to point

198
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,240
out that you've got this big scale

199
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,090
circulation pattern which is that air is

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,350
being sucked in off the ocean

201
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:19,200
rising up over the Himalayan mountains

202
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:22,300
and rising up another places too but the

203
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,600
circulation has reversed so if you're

204
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,300
standing here in the scenario the wind

205
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,580
has cut is 180 degrees the other

206
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,250
direction in the winter it was moving

207
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,070
out towards the ocean in the summer it's

208
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:42,300
moving in from the ocean that's a

209
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,300
monsoon okay so the monsoon circulation

210
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:52,960
monsoon circulation simply means we had

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,780
a seasonal shift in the wind now because

212
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,420
there's an ocean out here and it's

213
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,630
pretty warm that seasonal shift in the

214
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,570
wind means we have a dry season and then

215
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,690
a wet season okay it doesn't have to be

216
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:10,540
that way in fact the very definition of

217
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,420
a monsoon is that it's just simply a

218
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,610
seasonal reversal in wind direction so

219
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,320
bulls one way part of the year and then

220
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,500
it blows from another way another part

221
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,220
of the year it could and usually does

222
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,960
lead to a wet season and dry season now

223
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,660
if you're from New Mexico we talked

224
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,760
about the monsoon as the wet time in the

225
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,300
summer and we'll talk about that in a

226
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,920
second but truly the definition of

227
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,750
monsoon just means the wind has a

228
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,460
reverse direction and it doesn't mean

229
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,010
it's reversed for a day or even a week

230
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:46,360
it's a seasonal thing right so it

231
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,490
completely reverses for months usually

232
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,840
that's what that's what the true monsoon

233
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:56,050
is so here's an example of what India

234
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,850
looks like before monsoon and after a

235
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,950
monsoon so here's two pictures taken

236
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,960
from the same location you can see they

237
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,010
stitched them together and you can see

238
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,590
that the huge difference in vegetation

239
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:11,830
between the dry period and the wet

240
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:14,230
period a lot of what we know about

241
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,380
modern weather was first figured out

242
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:20,880
when people were trying to understand

243
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,980
when in why the monsoon in India happens

244
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,400
so

245
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,080
because it's so dry for so long farmers

246
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,670
would like to know exactly when they

247
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,190
should plant their crops to take

248
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:36,060
advantage of when all this rain starts

249
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,710
so 100 years or so ago people were

250
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,650
really interested in trying to figure

251
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,640
out the timing of the monsoon and a lot

252
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,650
of the things that we've been talking

253
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,650
about so far like air pressure and all

254
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,420
that stuff was studied intensely to try

255
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:51,030
to figure out how to time them on soon

256
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,390
turns out even today you can't really

257
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:57,300
predict it very well so it's it's not

258
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,040
something that the actual reversal often

259
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,900
just occurs on one date we're just

260
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,170
suddenly the whole circulation shifts

261
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:08,130
and it turns out it's not even today we

262
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,690
still can't completely predict that so

263
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm going to return to an animation we

264
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:18,530
saw last time and so we were talking in

265
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,670
the last lecture about how this ITCZ

266
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:25,230
corresponds to the to the warmest place

267
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:27,240
on earth so here we are in the first of

268
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,590
the year there is India right there

269
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:34,860
there's the Himalayan mountains right

270
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:39,510
there and we have the ITCZ here so I'm

271
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:42,450
going to move this further so in Howard

272
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,680
well we're in February right so just to

273
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,010
remind you what's happening along the

274
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,870
ITCZ you got easterly is coming in in

275
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,890
the northern hemisphere you got easter

276
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,920
bees coming in from the southern

277
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,020
hemisphere they are colliding right it's

278
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,660
Intertropical Convergence zone so

279
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,040
there's that convergence so right here

280
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,870
you can imagine the winds are coming

281
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:07,020
down off of Southeast Asia off of India

282
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,810
coming from the northwest moving towards

283
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,570
that equator right so I mean so towards

284
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,030
the ITCZ so we get in the spring

285
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,880
and notice what's happening the ITCZ is

286
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:22,860
creeping towards India and Southeast

287
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:26,640
Asia and then notice right there we're

288
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,930
actually coming in over India so from

289
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:34,230
their perspective they went from time

290
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,430
where the ITCZ was pretty far away to

291
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,260
the ITCZ

292
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,780
is actually on top

293
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,940
them and then throughout their their

294
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:46,460
summer it kind of lingers over the

295
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:50,310
continent and then fall it leaves again

296
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:53,730
okay so here's a couple graphical

297
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:58,770
illustrations of that so during the

298
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:01,650
winter the ITCZ is down here and if you

299
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:05,070
lived in northern Australia you have a

300
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,130
wet season right now because the ITCZ is

301
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,470
right above you but if you're in India

302
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,510
they have wind's coming mostly out of

303
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,270
the north down from the Himalayan

304
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:18,660
mountains and it's super dry by the time

305
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:21,690
summer rolls around the ITCZ

306
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,290
is up above India you've got wind coming

307
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:28,230
up from the south a lot of precipitation

308
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,940
but now it's left Australia and they're

309
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,500
getting wind coming from the south

310
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,830
coming from the middle of their

311
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,740
continent which is very dry so these two

312
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,280
locations have swapped their wet and dry

313
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,520
seasons now you can see this if you were

314
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:49,020
to make histograms bar graphs of

315
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,790
precipitation so in India so each one of

316
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,250
these is a month January February March

317
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,020
April cetera and then this is how many

318
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,800
millimeters of precipitation they get

319
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:02,550
each month so we're looking at this is

320
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,970
one location in India dry dry dry dry

321
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:08,880
and then all of a sudden in June you see

322
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:12,209
that bam huge increase of precipitation

323
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,880
that's the arrival of this ITCZ the

324
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,820
arrival of the quote-unquote the monsoon

325
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,510
and then it tapers down and then

326
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:23,370
disappears by the end of the year

327
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,010
Australia East northern part of

328
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,290
Australia is exactly the opposite you

329
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,390
can see this is their wet season and

330
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:34,070
then it disappears they have a super dry

331
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:38,640
summer and it's their winter because

332
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:40,530
seasons are reversed and then it gets

333
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,180
wet again at the end of the year ok so

334
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,040
these two are basically opposites of

335
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:48,000
each other and that's because of this

336
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,580
moving ITCZ just a reminder why is the

337
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,970
ITCZ moving because the seasons are

338
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,770
changed

339
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,480
so we're heating the northern hemisphere

340
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,120
they were heating the southern

341
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,910
hemisphere and the ITCZ is following the

342
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,300
warmest part of the ocean up and down

343
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:05,910
north and south so this animation shows

344
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,100
how the winds reverse in this part of

345
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:12,030
the world and what we're looking at is

346
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:15,900
about 15 years of wind and precipitation

347
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,820
data all averaged out so each one of

348
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,990
these little arrows shows you the

349
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,990
direction of the wind

350
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,150
the longer the arrow the faster the wind

351
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,160
right that's what the other doing and

352
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,880
then you see the precipitation are these

353
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,380
colors so if you think okay I'm gonna

354
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,420
stand right out here in India there's

355
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,970
the winter you can see the wind coming

356
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,730
down off the continent and it's dry and

357
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:42,030
boom there is the monsoon the winds

358
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,950
reverse wet and it returns back to dry

359
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,670
again you can see that band of rain

360
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,530
comes down and visits northern Australia

361
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,480
and then leaves it so these two

362
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:54,720
locations that we just showed in the

363
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,160
previous slide are having you know

364
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,140
reversed seasons

365
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,550
so when when's what the other ones dry

366
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,640
when the other ones dry the other ones

367
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:05,550
wet etcetera so we're going to look at a

368
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,250
little video here that's on YouTube that

369
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,860
was put together by some NASA scientists

370
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,020
and what they've done here is they've

371
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,960
been studying the monsoon using a lot of

372
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,090
satellite data and I'm mostly you're

373
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,060
just gonna let it play I'm gonna

374
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:26,030
interrupt it now and then just to make

375
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:29,070
obnoxious comments so let's start this

376
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:31,320
the monsoon is a seasonal rain and wind

377
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,400
pattern that was first described over

378
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,470
South Asia

379
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,470
you see the clouds blossoming here

380
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,150
during the summer part of the monsoon

381
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,130
for centuries people have known about it

382
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,320
but only recently have we received

383
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,660
enough data from satellites to really

384
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,730
describe what's going on okay so the

385
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:53,740
first thing is notice that down here

386
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:55,600
there is the date so June 14 2014 and

387
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,360
the time so what we're going to be

388
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,840
looking at is I mean images are being

389
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,630
updated every few minutes and so you'll

390
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,670
see the time whizzing by here day after

391
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,030
day after day also just make sure we're

392
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,740
clear this is all Doppler radar so this

393
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,340
is all precipitation they're showing in

394
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,740
the colors what you can see here is

395
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,620
moist air that has evaporated from the

396
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,010
ocean coming across India and providing

397
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,440
rainfall driving the monsoon season the

398
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,810
great thing about GPM is that it allows

399
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,470
us to see precipitating systems as a

400
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:34,650
whole over land and oceans and then as a

401
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,390
transition from one boundary to the next

402
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,250
all of this rainfall drives soil

403
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,590
moisture over land it's beneficial

404
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,600
because it promotes the economic

405
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,590
activity that people depend on for

406
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,970
example agriculture okay so just in case

407
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,970
you didn't catch it this is the soil

408
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:54,760
moisture color scheme over here so

409
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,400
they're looking at how the soil moisture

410
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:00,250
is changing throughout the reason rainy

411
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,320
season as well it fills the rivers which

412
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,970
provides water for human activity and

413
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,360
the natural environment as well as

414
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,890
transportation

415
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,410
if the rivers get too full of course it

416
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,270
becomes flooding at first the floods you

417
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,430
see here are fairly minor and

418
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,200
broad-scale but then they concentrated

419
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,630
in a few Wiggly lines which are the

420
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,370
river basins for example in central

421
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:27,340
eastern China in mountainous regions

422
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:30,870
when the ground becomes saturated due to

423
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:33,430
heavy rains it can lead to landslides

424
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,530
landslides kill thousands of people

425
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,230
every year and are primarily triggered

426
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,510
by rainfall they are especially common

427
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,410
within the Himalayan region each monsoon

428
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:46,780
season one really cool way to look at

429
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,670
the monsoon is to do a split screen and

430
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,580
look at the summer and the winter at the

431
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:54,430
same time in the summer the wind is

432
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,220
blowing onshore bringing the moist rain

433
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,930
Laden air into the continent in the

434
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,810
winter time it blows off the continent

435
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,610
now those winds are basically driven by

436
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,550
temperature differences between the

437
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,310
ocean and the land and where the land is

438
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:11,800
nice and warm the air expands and it

439
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,080
draws in the moist precipitation from

440
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,810
the ocean waters but in the winter time

441
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,000
it's very cold and you can see that the

442
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:22,360
moisture then it goes from the continent

443
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,740
back into the oceans okay so this is

444
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,950
what we talked about earlier with the

445
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,800
how the witness shift direction what

446
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,860
they're showing here are this is

447
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,690
temperature so you'll see that as it is

448
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,270
it moves from day night day night day

449
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,460
night you can see the temp the continent

450
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,470
getting warmer and then cooler warmer

451
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,920
than cooler and it doesn't also in the

452
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,050
winter the difference is on average the

453
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,440
continent is still warmer than the ocean

454
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,180
and over here on average the continent

455
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,330
is colder than the ocean so if you watch

456
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,740
these two you can see how yes the

457
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,900
continent gets warmer in the day and

458
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,580
cools off at night but the difference

459
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,890
between the two is how it compares to

460
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,830
the ocean so that's what those Fox

461
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:08,200
wedding colors mean over the past 50

462
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,140
years or so satellites have been used to

463
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,900
measure precipitation all

464
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,750
our earth with that data set we're able

465
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,330
to understand that monsoons occur not

466
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,520
only in South Asia and India but in

467
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,500
other parts of the world as well for

468
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,390
example Africa where the temperature

469
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,820
gradient is between the Atlantic Ocean

470
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,700
and the Sahara Desert the wind blows

471
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,130
from the moist Atlantic Ocean on to West

472
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,380
Africa providing the moisture for the

473
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,720
precipitation some of these westward

474
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,340
moving storms provoke hurricanes over

475
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,040
the Atlantic that occasionally make it

476
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,950
to the US southwestern North America

477
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,290
also has a summertime monsoon you see

478
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,090
high soil moisture in regions where

479
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,160
there's a lot of precipitation in

480
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,770
western Mexico later in the season this

481
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,830
extends up into the southwestern US and

482
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:58,110
the southern hemisphere has a monsoon as

483
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,910
well this occurs in the Northern

484
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,010
Hemisphere winter which is a southern

485
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,510
hemisphere summer when Australia is

486
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:07,950
warmer than the Ocean to the north

487
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:10,320
having a better understanding of the

488
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:12,810
global water cycle and monitoring

489
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,780
changes over time is important for

490
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:22,500
society for our everyday lives and our

491
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:24,720
long-term future so near the end of that

492
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,370
video they talked about the monsoon in

493
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,380
the southwestern part of the United

494
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,800
States and of course that's what we

495
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,650
referred to as the monsoon and as far as

496
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,490
monsoons go ours is really pretty wimpy

497
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:40,640
and monsoon purists would say that in

498
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,130
fact it hardly counts as a monsoon

499
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,690
compared to ones like India and Africa

500
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,730
but for us it's important because it

501
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,240
represents half of our annual rainfall

502
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:54,090
so we're going to talk about that and

503
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,010
back when we talked about humidity and

504
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,460
dew point we were talking about how the

505
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:01,680
dew point in New Mexico changes a lot

506
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,440
depending on the wind direction so if

507
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,620
you have wind coming out of the West or

508
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,830
the the North you we typically have very

509
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,320
low dew points because the air is coming

510
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:16,740
from a pretty cold source whereas if we

511
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,320
have winds coming from the East or the

512
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,210
South of the southeast we typically have

513
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,730
relatively high dew points because it's

514
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:27,270
come somewhere from a pretty warm

515
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:29,400
and source so the big picture about the

516
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:32,190
New Mexican monsoon is that through most

517
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,050
of the year our winds are like this

518
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,900
they're coming out of the West they are

519
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:39,750
we were in the westerlies and then for

520
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,300
July August a little bit September we

521
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,300
get a couple months where the winds very

522
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:48,690
weakly kind of reverse and we get a weak

523
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,390
easterly or southeasterly or maybe even

524
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,640
a southerly flow and that's what

525
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,910
triggers our summertime thunderstorms

526
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,360
that we call them on soon so to explain

527
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:01,830
why this happens I'm going to go over a

528
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,030
new concept that's a that's kind of

529
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:08,250
abstract but we kind of have to cover it

530
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,050
to understand the next maps we're gonna

531
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,300
see let's imagine that we've got the

532
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:14,040
we're going to cut a cross-section of

533
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,130
the atmosphere that those are supposed

534
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:25,350
to be trees and I have a blob of cold

535
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:27,660
air and cold air is pretty dense and

536
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:32,970
right next to it I've got a blob of warm

537
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:35,550
air and warm air if you warm up air it

538
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:40,740
expands so my blog the warm air is more

539
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:43,200
expanded and let's imagine that I was

540
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,300
gonna get into a balloon well first of

541
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,860
all let's just think about this is even

542
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,620
though I've got a ground in trees let's

543
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,990
imagine we're at sea level down here

544
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,630
what's the air pressure at sea level

545
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,840
it's about a thousand thirteen millibars

546
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,430
okay

547
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,350
so back when we talked about air

548
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,530
pressure let's imagine again into a

549
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,720
balloon and I got my barometer and I go

550
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:07,350
up and I'm trying to find how high I

551
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:12,930
have to go to get to 700 millibars okay

552
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:15,810
and so let's say I find that spot and it

553
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,340
turns out it's about right here okay so

554
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,940
go up in the balloon

555
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,100
find the 700 millibar level and plot it

556
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,010
on a map and I take many balloon rides

557
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,930
to find this and when I get to the warm

558
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,890
air what I would find is because the

559
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:34,920
cold air is more dense and compacted I

560
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:36,840
get to the 700 millibar level sooner

561
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,700
than if I was in a balloon and

562
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,750
into the warm air I have to go farther

563
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:50,400
up to get to that 700 millibar level so

564
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:54,179
it might be something like this and we

565
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:59,299
call this height in this case to the 700

566
00:27:54,179 --> 00:28:05,850
millibar level we call this the geo

567
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:07,950
potential height now that's fancier term

568
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,020
that we need in this class we can just

569
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,450
imagine how high do you have to go to

570
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,610
get to a certain pressure level I could

571
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,169
make one for a 500 millibars I'd have to

572
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,360
go higher up I could make it for

573
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:20,669
whatever level I wanted but in this case

574
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,890
I'm going up to 700 millibars point is

575
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,380
yeah if I were to do this experiment in

576
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,559
a balloon I would have to go further up

577
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,600
to get to the 700 millibar because that

578
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,870
air is more expanded because it's warmer

579
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,110
so we're gonna see this on a map in a

580
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:43,580
second we would call this area up here a

581
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:45,659
high and this area down here a low so

582
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,630
like we talked about air pressure you

583
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:50,270
had highs and lows it's similar to that

584
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:54,659
but it's talking about a different thing

585
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:56,460
the surface is high the geopotential

586
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:00,360
height surface is what we call this as

587
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:04,529
high and the height surface is low okay

588
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:06,090
so we got to do this because I want to

589
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:08,130
we're not going too deep here I just

590
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,700
want to explain this too so that the

591
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,770
next map will make sense so we're going

592
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,039
to look at some maps of this what we

593
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:18,750
call the 700 millibars surface and I put

594
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,919
these maps on learn they're also on my

595
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:27,120
website and what they've done here is

596
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:30,950
for example this first one february 1st

597
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,649
to February 28th so that's looking at

598
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:38,460
every day in the month of February for

599
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:41,549
the last 30 years averaging where that

600
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:49,620
700 millibars height level is imparting

601
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:50,470
as contours so here for example 31 40 ok

602
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,809
so what does that mean

603
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:58,630
so this map and all the ones we're gonna

604
00:29:52,809 --> 00:30:01,360
look at are 700 millibar height how far

605
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,090
up do you have to go above sea level to

606
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,480
get to 700 millibars it doesn't tell you

607
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,740
this but the units are in meters so I'd

608
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,549
have to go up three thousand one hundred

609
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,010
forty meters to get to 700 millibars and

610
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:19,990
if I stayed on this line that's exactly

611
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:21,549
going to be 700 millibars over here the

612
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,460
height would be three thousand one

613
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:26,559
hundred and thirty meters 2010 so you

614
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,950
can see that the height is going down as

615
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,450
these as we move to the north why is

616
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,780
that because the air up here is pretty

617
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:37,900
cold so it's compressed air down here is

618
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,789
pretty warm so it's expanded so we can

619
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,789
put in some highs and lows here just

620
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:44,820
like a pressure map so at the top here

621
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:47,380
the numbers are smaller smaller smaller

622
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:53,230
there's a low I'm gonna fit right there

623
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:56,860
and then here I've got a high right here

624
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:58,419
okay so this low is due the fact that

625
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,390
the Arab there's just really cold and

626
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:05,980
compressed this high this kind of loop

627
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:09,070
here is due to one of the subtropical

628
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,659
highs and this one is called the Bermuda

629
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:17,169
high which I'm just gonna write down

630
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:19,929
here the Bermuda high and this high

631
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:21,880
pressure system will as we see will

632
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:23,620
change just like that there's one over

633
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,659
here the Pacific subtropical high which

634
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:30,039
isn't really showing so much on this map

635
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:33,250
here okay the rules for which direction

636
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:35,610
winds go are the same as they were for

637
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,530
air pressure clockwise around a high

638
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:42,880
counterclockwise or on the low in the

639
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:46,150
northern hemisphere okay so here's the

640
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,900
high so I've got clockwise around this

641
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:54,159
high parallel to the contours so my wind

642
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:57,850
is like this and then over here it's

643
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,090
still in that same general trend and

644
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,540
that it's a clockwise sense around the

645
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,830
high

646
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:12,169
counterclockwise sense around the the

647
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:15,440
low and if I were to just kind of draw

648
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:17,030
some of these in what I see is basically

649
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,230
the winds are going parallel to the

650
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,910
contours and time and time again in this

651
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,860
part of the country that gets you air

652
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:29,960
that's come and kind of down from the

653
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,760
west-northwest direction right so in New

654
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,290
Mexico we just think about New Mexico we

655
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,870
get wind comes straight out of the West

656
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:40,610
here okay and we've got westerlies in

657
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:44,570
fact the whole country's in westerlies

658
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:46,280
at this point and only down here do we

659
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,740
see anything that's kind of easterly's

660
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:53,900
way down in here

661
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:57,590
okay so we can move on to March and it's

662
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,860
pretty much exactly the same the whole

663
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,390
country is still in the westerlies so I

664
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,000
will draw a few arrows here to

665
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,160
illustrate but our winds are still

666
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,650
coming out of the West so they're cold

667
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:20,360
and they're dry okay so now we're moving

668
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:23,809
on to April here and we can see that we

669
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:32,110
have a high down here that's our Bermuda

670
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:35,030
high we still have a low up in here and

671
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,470
we still have there's really nothing

672
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,429
much has changed too much yet we still

673
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:43,850
have counterclockwise around the high

674
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:47,960
and everybody is still pretty much in

675
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:50,240
the westerlies including us okay so we

676
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:56,020
are we still have wind coming out of the

677
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,250
west all right we get to May okay so

678
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,410
same kind of thing we don't really see

679
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:05,360
it down here but the Bermuda high is

680
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:08,179
kind of lingering down here and again

681
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,820
for us New Mexico still nothing much has

682
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:14,290
changed except we're starting to see

683
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,290
this little dip down here

684
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:21,820
okay so our winds are coming out of the

685
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:25,960
West but they're actually starting to

686
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:28,419
come sort of across this the northern

687
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,879
part of the Gulf of California right

688
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,760
here and it's possible that we might be

689
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,290
picking up some moisture here but if we

690
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:40,210
go further back it's still coming off

691
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:42,339
the cold Pacific Ocean okay so so far

692
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:46,570
nothing much has changed yet we're still

693
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:48,970
in the westerlies and now I'm gonna

694
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:52,089
break it up so the maps we've been

695
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:54,010
seeing so far or once a month I'm gonna

696
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:56,579
break it down into one every two weeks

697
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:59,140
now so this is the first half of June

698
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,880
okay here's our Bermuda high it's

699
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,630
getting stronger why is it getting

700
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,730
stronger

701
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,140
same reason the Pacific subtropical high

702
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,640
gets stronger in the summer we're

703
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,550
heating the northern part of the

704
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,190
hemisphere and it's getting stronger and

705
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:16,390
it's growing so here it is here's the

706
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:19,630
high and we are low is off the page here

707
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:25,420
somewhere clockwise around the high okay

708
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:31,180
so I'm gonna go around this way parallel

709
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:33,910
to the contours okay so notice that if I

710
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,880
were to kind of draw this out Southeast

711
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,770
Texas is starting to to change its wind

712
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:44,560
direction right there moving out of the

713
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:45,970
westerlies we are still coming out of

714
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,760
the West but we still have this little

715
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,460
dip here where but potentially getting

716
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,430
some moisture from Gulf of California

717
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:57,849
here all right boo rest of the country

718
00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:01,770
still pretty much in the westerlies okay

719
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:06,460
let's go the last half of June now our

720
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:08,050
Bermuda high is now stronger and so we

721
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:12,579
can see the influence of that

722
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:17,500
here's counterclockwise road rotation

723
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:19,619
clockwise clockwise we have a funny

724
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,349
little nose here but it's still

725
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:26,170
clockwise okay notice what's happening

726
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:28,880
so at the end of June if we follow our

727
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,670
error trajectory back in time

728
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,180
it's possible that some of it could have

729
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,979
come from the Gulf of Mexico except I

730
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,650
had to travel all the way across Mexico

731
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:41,749
and they come around this way northern

732
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,940
Mexico still getting it out of the

733
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:47,359
Pacific but we're starting to see a

734
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,630
transition to air that's coming from a

735
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,130
different place well if if it had to

736
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,710
come all the way across Mexico it

737
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,569
probably lost most of its moisture on

738
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,630
the way here so it's still not really

739
00:36:56,569 --> 00:37:01,160
humid air for the most part and if you

740
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,729
if you know anything about the monsoon

741
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,309
you know that in general it starts

742
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:09,289
usually about the first week of July and

743
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:11,410
we're getting really close right we're

744
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:14,920
near the end of June

745
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:22,039
ok so now we're going to move on to

746
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:26,599
beginning of July ok so now here's our

747
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:31,190
high and we've got clockwise rotation

748
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:37,900
around the high and notice what we've

749
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:41,719
got here we've now transitioned so that

750
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,809
the wind that's coming into New Mexico

751
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:48,349
if we trace it back has its origins in

752
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:50,420
the Gulf of Mexico and unlike we saw in

753
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,640
the previous one it doesn't have to go

754
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,710
all the way out to the Pacific and loop

755
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,039
back some of it looks like it has a

756
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:04,249
direct route across new across Mexico

757
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:07,640
and right into New Mexico and that is

758
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:10,999
the trigger of our monsoon so we are now

759
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:13,719
out of the westerlies and we're starting

760
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:16,069
to get flow that's maybe southerly flow

761
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:18,140
maybe a little bit of a southeast

762
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:20,869
component remember these are averaged

763
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,489
over 30 years so the wind can change day

764
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:24,229
to day a little bit this is what happens

765
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:26,150
when you average over you know a

766
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:31,479
two-week period for 30 years

767
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:34,069
ok so then we get to the end of July and

768
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:36,079
here's our Bermuda high so you notice

769
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:39,019
that the Bermuda high over time has been

770
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,369
migrating to the north so that's what

771
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:42,049
the Pacific subtropical high it's

772
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:42,740
migrating to the north it's out its out

773
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:46,400
here so

774
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:50,450
we're not on our map really but that's

775
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:54,410
what's causing this this shift so again

776
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:57,650
we can draw clockwise around the high

777
00:38:54,410 --> 00:39:01,030
and it's pretty clear from this now that

778
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:04,490
any wind that's coming this direction

779
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:07,790
has its origins from the Gulf of Mexico

780
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:11,810
right so you've got circulation coming

781
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:13,670
around entering New Mexico straight from

782
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,490
the Gulf of Mexico so we've got high dew

783
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:26,960
points now monsoon is in full swing

784
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:32,600
usually okay

785
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:38,380
so and in August is pretty much more the

786
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,380
same story here's our high here's our

787
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:46,550
rotation around that high now one thing

788
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:58,240
that's I want you to notice that's

789
00:39:46,550 --> 00:40:02,480
different here if I go back to say June

790
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,580
do you see how close the contours are to

791
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,740
each other remember when we talked about

792
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:10,190
wind and we said that the wind direct

793
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:12,320
the wind speed is proportional to the

794
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,650
pressure gradient so the closer these

795
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,450
are together the faster the wind goes

796
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,720
that was with pressure gradient it's the

797
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:25,640
same thing with this height gradient so

798
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:28,430
if I go to where we are now notice we

799
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,260
see almost and there's no contours

800
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:34,310
across the the entire state at all

801
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:35,930
there's a very low height gradient also

802
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,970
we could say there's a very low pressure

803
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,940
gradient which means that the winds

804
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:43,190
themselves are very very weak okay so

805
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,790
even though I'm drawing it in these

806
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:49,010
loops like this it's a very weak wind

807
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:51,470
okay it's a very very weak wind which is

808
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:54,530
one of the things that makes purists say

809
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,390
this isn't really a very proper monsoon

810
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,789
the winds just kind of

811
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:02,119
I in the moisture kind of trickles

812
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:05,710
upwards towards us but anyway let's keep

813
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:08,269
going so that's beginning of August and

814
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:11,420
now we're getting to the end of August

815
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:14,269
and what's happening now is our high

816
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:16,900
pressure the Bermuda high starting to

817
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:19,609
make its way back to the South okay and

818
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,769
our Pacific subtropical high which is

819
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:23,839
out here in the ocean is also starting

820
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:27,619
to make its way back but we're getting

821
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:31,819
that clockwise rotation and so we are

822
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:34,519
still if I kind of draw in some arrows

823
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:38,869
here we're still getting moisture out of

824
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:52,789
the Gulf of Mexico for the most part

825
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:57,670
here then we get to so beginning in

826
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:57,670
September and we're still in it

827
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:09,369
now our monsoon on average typically

828
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,720
dies out about the middle of September

829
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:16,759
ok so here we were in the beginning of

830
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:20,890
September here or in the last half of

831
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:23,799
September and so here we've got our high

832
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:30,109
and it's kind of a weird-shaped high but

833
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:34,460
we're getting this and this ok so notice

834
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:36,470
what happened the northern part of New

835
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,410
Mexico is now if you follow it around is

836
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:41,150
coming out of the Pacific Ocean

837
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:44,539
maybe the southeast part in New Mexico

838
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,730
still getting some from Gulf of Mexico

839
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:49,339
but it's still having to travel quite a

840
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,759
ways to get there that's different than

841
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:56,299
just a couple weeks before when we had

842
00:42:51,759 --> 00:43:01,039
wind coming across pretty much straight

843
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:02,809
from the Gulf of Mexico here so by that

844
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,259
when you start making the transition

845
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:07,230
back to moisture from the Pacific

846
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:09,869
monsoon is over

847
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:12,510
okay and so somewhere about halfway

848
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:16,980
through September we stopped getting

849
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:22,800
those daily thunderstorms I'm gonna say

850
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:32,190
the monsoon is over okay and now when we

851
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:35,880
move on to October so that Bermuda high

852
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:40,859
is now centered again it's marching its

853
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:46,380
way south and it's getting weaker so we

854
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:48,960
have this this and now we're pretty much

855
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,810
back into the westerlies okay so in

856
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,970
October we're back in the westerlies and

857
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,680
then it just goes back to the kind of

858
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:59,700
where we started so here we are late

859
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:06,330
October and we are right back where we

860
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:08,160
were before the monsoon so why do we

861
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:11,600
have them on soon we have a monsoon

862
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,190
because this shifting subtropical high

863
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,880
migrates north and south with the

864
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:22,080
seasons and it changes the circulation

865
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:26,160
pattern around it so when it gets to

866
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:28,740
about beginning of July this is situated

867
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,390
far enough north that we start to get

868
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:33,210
into a little bit of an easterly

869
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:36,480
southeasterly flow and we're out of the

870
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:39,570
westerlies finally and then that allows

871
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,609
some cumulonimbus to occur and then a

872
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,859
couple months after that it starts

873
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:45,930
migrating its way back down and we go

874
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:50,250
back into the westerlies and we're back

875
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:52,200
to dry air so back when we talked about

876
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:54,690
dewpoint we looked at one of these

877
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,119
graphs and this is dew point in

878
00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:00,540
Albuquerque at the airport during the

879
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:05,880
monsoon season so there's a blue line

880
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:09,869
and a red line the blue line is the dew

881
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:13,410
point as recorded in 2013 the red line

882
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:17,460
is the average of the dew point in the

883
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:19,800
previous 30 years okay so let's just

884
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,730
look at the red line first the red line

885
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,850
again

886
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:26,580
for 30 years and what we see so so

887
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,090
dewpoint is on the the y-axis so 30

888
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:31,890
degrees that would be in Fahrenheit and

889
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:34,200
so in June or typically in the

890
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:37,260
westerlies and so we have pretty low dew

891
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:42,000
points and on average it ramps up and

892
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:46,590
ramps up until we get to this 47 degree

893
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,660
line this green line right here and the

894
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:52,530
weather service here has kind of picked

895
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:56,250
that line it's kind of arbitrary but the

896
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:59,520
idea is that if we have three days of

897
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:02,310
dew points above 47 degrees three

898
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,290
consecutive days then we're going to

899
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,990
call that the beginning of the monsoon

900
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:09,750
and if you average the last 30 years

901
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:13,500
that comes out to be this line right

902
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:16,140
here is July 11th so right around JA

903
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,720
July 10th or 11th or so is about three

904
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:21,030
days beyond where that red line crosses

905
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,730
the Green Line so you'll read about the

906
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:27,510
average date the average start or the

907
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:29,250
New Mexican monsoon is about July 10th

908
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,460
or 11th that's where it comes from just

909
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,640
averaging 30 years of dew point and then

910
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,950
usually our dew point stays above that

911
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,770
47 degree line and then a dips back down

912
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,870
so this is September 9th right around

913
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:45,450
there and then it continues to go

914
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:48,930
downhill as we go back into the

915
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,940
westerlies okay so that's average right

916
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:55,440
averaged over 30 years it gives you kind

917
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:59,100
of a smooth red line now the blue line

918
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,940
is what happens in an actual year in

919
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:04,440
this case this is 2013 and so you see a

920
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,500
lot of Wiggles up and down that

921
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,870
correlate to wind direction so when it's

922
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,600
high that means we had wind coming out

923
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:15,570
of the East higher dew points when it's

924
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:18,600
low that's due wind coming out of the

925
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:20,790
west or north that's low dew points and

926
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,680
so you can see that leading up to the

927
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:25,350
actual monsoon the winds are changing

928
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,800
direction right so we've got easterlies

929
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:30,630
westerlies easterlies westerlies and

930
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,720
finally it kind of gets into the

931
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:34,619
easterlies and stays there for a while

932
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,390
within the monsoon

933
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:39,599
our little variations where the winds

934
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:43,170
shift back and forth a little bit but we

935
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,390
hit but at least in 2013 we you know for

936
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:48,269
the most part we stayed above that Green

937
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:50,160
Line throughout most of the monsoon

938
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:53,220
season so throughout most of the summer

939
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,650
our dew point was hovering you know over

940
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,319
50 degrees or so you see a couple places

941
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:01,140
where dip down a little bit and so we

942
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,359
call those monsoon breaks usually their

943
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,490
correspondent with times when we have

944
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,109
either a high pressure center or the

945
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:10,049
winds come out of the west or the north

946
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:12,749
and we have a lack of cumulonimbus and

947
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:14,309
our dew points go down and then on this

948
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:16,950
particular year it kind of had a crazy

949
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:19,700
end looks like we had a lot of unusually

950
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:22,920
humid air in middle September and

951
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:25,579
finally dies you know somewhere here

952
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,829
near you know last half of September

953
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:30,990
well every year is different

954
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:34,730
so here's 2014 we see we had a couple

955
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:37,829
really pretty significant monsoon breaks

956
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,839
everywhere you see this referred to this

957
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:42,569
as a monsoon burst which means that we

958
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:45,869
have air with extra water vapor in it

959
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:52,980
and often that leads to more

960
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:57,809
cumulonimbus if we go to sea 2015 here's

961
00:48:52,980 --> 00:49:00,329
an interesting one here's 2016 so we had

962
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:03,180
what's called an early start to the

963
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:06,599
monsoon so three days after the Green

964
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:08,999
Line there's one two three monsoon

965
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:10,890
starts and it's before it's before July

966
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:12,420
so if you look at the newspaper

967
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,220
headlines back then they were super

968
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,069
excited that the monsoon has started

969
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:21,269
early and so we have several days of

970
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:23,390
monsoon activity and then it crashes and

971
00:49:21,269 --> 00:49:26,249
we see that the dew point went way down

972
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:28,079
super dry air right dewpoints like 15

973
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:30,660
degrees that's that's like middle of the

974
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,839
winter air and it's stayed low and

975
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:36,359
didn't rebound back to normal until this

976
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,599
is what July 21st before we're back to

977
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,730
kind of average so we had a really

978
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,710
basically got a completely dry month

979
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,690
that it rained right in the end of June

980
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,250
very beginning of July and then the rest

981
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:50,630
of the July was pretty much

982
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:53,100
dry before we bounce back to normal

983
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:56,190
everyone soon season is different has a

984
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,980
unique monsoon break or monsoon burst

985
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,930
pattern and it's only by averaging every

986
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,600
year over and over and over do you get

987
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:06,870
that kind of smooth red line that shows

988
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:10,140
you what the average dew point was so if

989
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,850
we made precipitation histograms kind of

990
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,210
like the ones that we saw from India and

991
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:18,150
Australia this is what it looks like so

992
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:20,730
the way you read these is this first bar

993
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:22,710
is January and then it goes through the

994
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,950
air and the last bar is December

995
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:29,150
so notice say along the west coast here

996
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:33,900
in Mexico and California you've got wet

997
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:37,860
relatively wet winters dry summers ok so

998
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:39,990
nurse ed wet winter dry summer that's

999
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,360
what we call Mediterranean climate we

1000
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:45,120
talked about this last time that Pacific

1001
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:47,070
subtropical high forms out here it makes

1002
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,310
it really dry along the coast in the

1003
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:52,560
summer and then the the mid-latitude

1004
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:55,980
cyclones come through and make it wet in

1005
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,140
the in the winter we see the range tidal

1006
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:01,070
effects over here in Nevada it's pretty

1007
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:03,360
much dry all year round so in Las Vegas

1008
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:06,210
but notice what happens when you get

1009
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,400
over here you see a completely different

1010
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:11,280
patterns so here in Hermosillo

1011
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:15,540
it's super super dry super super dry and

1012
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,060
then about June July BAM we get a big

1013
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:22,230
increase in precipitation and then the

1014
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:27,150
tapers off or this one or this one okay

1015
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:29,900
those are classic monsoon patterns so

1016
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:33,240
here in the states we've got two saan

1017
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:35,940
very very dry dry dry dry the driest

1018
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,180
month in there is June and then BAM the

1019
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,800
wettest month is July the month after

1020
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:43,470
that's where that monsoon circulation

1021
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,240
starts so we go from the westerlies to

1022
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:48,770
the easterlies or the South easterlies

1023
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:55,290
and suddenly Tucson gets their monsoon

1024
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:58,560
start so monsoon precipitation can be

1025
00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:00,270
noticed on these histograms with this

1026
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,910
kind of pattern where it gets super dry

1027
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:03,280
and also

1028
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:06,910
spike or a said with a circulation

1029
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,730
suddenly shifted in fact there's this

1030
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:12,340
dotted line right here that says 50% so

1031
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:15,970
this right through in here that means

1032
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:19,000
the area within here gets 50% of their

1033
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:23,320
annual precipitation during the monsoon

1034
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,420
and so what we think of is our monsoon

1035
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:30,580
is really a Mexican phenomenon in fact

1036
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,470
decades ago it was referred to in

1037
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:37,330
scientific literature as the Mexican

1038
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:39,190
monsoon and later people in the u.s.

1039
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:42,310
renamed it they called it the North

1040
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:44,050
American monsoon so we kind of stole it

1041
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:49,900
from the Mexicans but what do you know

1042
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:52,750
so these contours show how much of your

1043
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:56,380
annual precipitation comes during the

1044
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:59,020
summer so this number you're 60 percent

1045
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:04,030
of your annual precipitation falls in

1046
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:06,280
the summer 55 percent 50 45 so notice

1047
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:10,390
that of all the states in the Union

1048
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,190
we have the biggest blob of monsuno

1049
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,930
precipitation meaning that for New

1050
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:17,130
Mexico roughly half of our precipitation

1051
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:19,870
falls in the summer due to this

1052
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:22,570
monsoonal circulation but for the most

1053
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:25,480
part it's actually a Mexican phenomenon

1054
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:30,120
we just get just the dregs of it up into

1055
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,120
New Mexico Arizona gets a little bit too

1056
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,700
you
