1
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:13,380
hey this is Mel strong in this lecture

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,180
is on El Nino and La Nina also known as

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,529
the El Nino Southern Oscillation or ENSO

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,650
so we're going to start today looking at

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,400
Earth nautical net and right now I'm

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,470
looking at the surface winds and I've

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,430
got a date a day here in the summer in

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,260
July and so we can see a couple things

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,750
here's the big Pacific subtropical high

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,050
swirling around out in the ocean there's

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,480
another high over there and these little

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,940
guys here are tropical storms of some

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,719
kind maybe they are hurricanes or maybe

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,469
not not sure and if we look down here we

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,680
can also see this funny-looking thing

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,600
here is also another subtropical high

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,320
it's not very symmetrical it's a weird

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,949
shape today but ok so what I'm going to

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,860
do is I'm going to look at sea surface

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,909
temperature so to do that I click the

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,200
word earth mode is ocean animate

22
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:20,220
currents overlay SST for sea surface

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,070
temperature okay so the colors now

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,470
represent what we call the skin

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,119
temperature of the ocean so this is the

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,310
temperature of the ocean water right at

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,590
the surface and we can actually measure

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,470
this we've got satellites up that

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,600
measure this every day and so the colors

30
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,119
represent temperatures you might expect

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,090
and so a couple things we can see for

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,240
one thing we can see there's a band of

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,680
pretty warm temperatures not exactly at

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,090
the equator but kind of around the

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,310
equator so if I could just kind of zoom

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,310
out all right so we've got a band of

37
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,530
pretty warm temperatures near the

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,030
equatorial region but it's not very

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:03,240
symmetrical okay so for example over

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,280
here this purple that's even warmer than

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,310
the red so you've got this pool of

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,800
really warm water kind of over here in

43
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,800
the western part of the Pacific Basin

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,490
and then there's this weird thing where

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,890
right at the equator it's actually kind

46
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,220
of cooler than the water around it which

47
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,130
is maybe not what you would expect now

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:31,080
if I look around here let's look at the

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,610
Pacific Basin so notice that if I were

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,760
to pick say a certain line of latitude

51
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,670
and go straight across stick at this

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,400
line at latitude right here that over on

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,490
the eastern side of the Pacific Ocean

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,400
it's colder than it is on the western

55
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,730
side right so you can see this greenish

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,470
yellow color coming down here whereas if

57
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,490
I just pick one line of latitude like

58
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,670
that spot right there

59
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,650
and go all the way across it's much much

60
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,380
warmer on the western side than the

61
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,440
eastern side so something is causing the

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,970
ocean to be asymmetric in terms of

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,180
temperature that there's something

64
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,510
that's dragging colder water down from

65
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,600
the north and allowing this warm water

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:21,140
to kind of come up from the south okay

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:23,370
and if I look at the southern basin I

68
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,940
see kind of the same thing

69
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,570
I see cooler water that is being pulled

70
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,360
up here to the north and I see warmer

71
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,410
water over here to the west it's not

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,980
symmetrical

73
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,910
and if I move over to the Atlantic I see

74
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,790
something kind of similar

75
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,850
I've got cooler water up here or more

76
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,700
water down there and up here somewhere

77
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,850
again cooler water down there warmer

78
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,860
water up here so the ocean basins are

79
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,850
not symmetrical in their temperature so

80
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,010
the first question is why is that okay

81
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:02,850
why would it be colder over here and

82
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:08,330
warmer over here so the answer is that

83
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:12,090
just a minute ago we saw that there are

84
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,739
big clockwise winds out here in the

85
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,060
Pacific the Pacific is a subtropical

86
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:21,390
high and then over here in the Atlantic

87
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,240
another one big again it's not perfectly

88
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,100
shaped on on this particular day and of

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,740
course they go counterclockwise and

90
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,770
the Pacific I'm sorry in the in the

91
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,900
southern hemisphere so you've got the

92
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,960
subtropical highs that are just spinning

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,710
around and around and around all day

94
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,920
long every day out in the ocean and the

95
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,290
wind blows the ocean so the reason we

96
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,040
have ocean currents for the most part is

97
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,280
wind the reason we have waves is wind

98
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,320
wind is what's pushing the ocean around

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,030
and so when we look at this temperature

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,070
so I'll go again

101
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:05,950
ocean currents SST that is the result of

102
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,170
the Pacific subtropical high blowing the

103
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,930
ocean towards the south blowing this

104
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:15,100
colder water down towards the equator

105
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,690
and down here same thing except instead

106
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,820
of going clockwise it's going

107
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,610
counterclockwise so you've got winds

108
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,250
blowing cold water towards the north so

109
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,390
one of the things that these subtropical

110
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:31,810
highs do is they help bring cold water

111
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,310
from up here down towards the equator

112
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,680
and they take warm water from the

113
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,940
equator and bring it up towards the

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
poles and they do that in both

115
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:45,490
hemispheres so they help mix up colder

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,510
and warmer water okay so I've got a

117
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:52,210
little map here of the world and so in

118
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,980
general what we would notice is that so

119
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,770
so before I start this is I kind of

120
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,250
sketched in the equator here there's a

121
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:03,430
big loop that's out in the ocean

122
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:08,410
big circulation pattern and it kind of

123
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:13,180
looks like this and down here it looks

124
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:16,390
like this and those loops are being

125
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,370
caused by the subtropical highs and in

126
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,780
the you know it's swirling the ocean

127
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:26,590
around in the giant circle and that

128
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:28,780
giant circle is called a gyre so the the

129
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,950
big circulation pattern that we see in

130
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,530
the ocean basins is as big clockwise and

131
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,660
then counterclockwise rotation of the

132
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,850
ocean caused by the Pacific's or the

133
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,570
subtropical highs just spinning and

134
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,120
spanning and span

135
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:46,540
okay so that's a primary feature that we

136
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,410
see well let's add a few more things to

137
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,290
this now what we know is that near the

138
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,660
equator we have the ITCZ right if you

139
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,630
remember back to that what's happening

140
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,910
at the ITCZ we've got easterlies what

141
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,580
are they doing they're converging so I'm

142
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:09,820
gonna sketch that in a little bit so all

143
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:11,980
along here I have easterly's that are

144
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,370
coming together now remember we said in

145
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,770
a past or yeah in the past lecture that

146
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,660
the convergence isn't exactly at the

147
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,220
equator that it moves around with the

148
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,130
seasons okay so I'm drawing this to be

149
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,080
along the equator just to show it to

150
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,710
make a point here but remember this

151
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:35,800
exact spot changes with the seasons

152
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:37,180
okay so there's our easterly's okay so

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,970
let's just think about that for a minute

154
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:47,110
if you had wind blowing from from east

155
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,970
to west this direction and it's blowing

156
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,290
along the top of the ocean what it's

157
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,080
going to do is it's going to basically

158
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,590
skim the warmest part of the water and

159
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,050
push it towards the west so let's

160
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,720
imagine like if you're in a swimming

161
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,910
pool and you start doing this to the top

162
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,950
of the water with your hand you scoot

163
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,790
that water along the out of the surface

164
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:12,640
of the pool same things happening here

165
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,560
so as a result we end up taking this

166
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,240
warm water because this is near the

167
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,100
equator so it's going to be some of the

168
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,280
warmest water in the ocean at least it

169
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,050
should be and we're gonna shove it this

170
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,290
direction and what's going to happen is

171
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,810
that really warm water pools up over

172
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:35,020
here okay so that's what we're seeing

173
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:37,599
over here so this purple blob this is

174
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:42,130
all really warm water that's kind of

175
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,200
been shoved over from the from the east

176
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:50,350
it's blown across the ocean so if I look

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:51,800
at my easterlies let's look at my okay

178
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,790
so there's

179
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,000
there's my easterlies okay right there

180
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,589
so those are winds and the winds are

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,709
just kind of pushing that warm water

182
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:06,200
across the equal equatorial zone you see

183
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,760
they're going and today that's a little

184
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,190
curvy there but they're coming this

185
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,690
direction and they kind of die out on

186
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,470
this particular day but they're they're

187
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:20,630
pooling this really warm water over here

188
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:22,940
but I buy all these island nations go

189
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,220
back to this again okay so there it is

190
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,350
at purple water that's the warmest part

191
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,990
of the ocean there's always a pool of

192
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,230
just really warm and may feel like bath

193
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:37,370
water if you got into it okay so I'm

194
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,810
going to add that to my drawing and I'm

195
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:47,779
just going to kind of approximate that

196
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:50,000
out in here there's this pool of very

197
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,380
warm water right and the boundaries are

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,720
always changing but it's just kind of

199
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:59,660
over here okay so if you're if you're

200
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,120
removing water from this part of the

201
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,270
ocean then there has to be some other

202
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,490
water that comes up and takes its place

203
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,520
okay so that's part of the story here

204
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,230
that if I remove the warm water you're

205
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,740
gonna have to replace it with something

206
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,100
else

207
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,990
now the something else happens to

208
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,579
coincide with a place where there is

209
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:26,740
this big Bend

210
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:29,630
okay so right here where the where the

211
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,300
the gyre is making a turn by the

212
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,240
continent imagine it's like you're

213
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,529
pulling water away from the continent so

214
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,930
I'm just going to kind of draw some

215
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:44,140
arrows to show that I'm pulling water

216
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:48,230
away from the continent like this

217
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,880
alright so if I'm if I'm moving water

218
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,850
across the ocean here and then pulling

219
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,770
water away from the continent here we

220
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,110
need to produce more water to replace

221
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,810
the water that's being pulled away and

222
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,970
it turns out the water that that comes

223
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,410
in to replace it comes up from near the

224
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,379
bottom of the ocean

225
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:14,319
that's called upwelling so all along

226
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:17,329
here all along here and all along here

227
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,529
there is water that's coming up from the

228
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,419
bottom of the ocean

229
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:25,459
okay I'm gonna draw that in blue I'm

230
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:27,289
gonna call this up Welling so what's the

231
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:29,539
water at the bottom of the ocean like

232
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:31,759
it's very close to the freezing point

233
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:34,249
now because of all the pressure it

234
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,479
doesn't actually freeze down there but

235
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,099
there's places at the bottom of the

236
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:39,529
ocean that are actually at about zero

237
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:40,970
degrees Celsius or 32 Fahrenheit that's

238
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,639
at the freezing point it's just not

239
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:47,119
frozen so that water comes up to the

240
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,970
surface and is really really cold so

241
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:51,889
this is also a shock to anybody who has

242
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,589
tried to go swimming in Southern

243
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:57,470
California so right so for example la is

244
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,839
somewhere kind of like right in here and

245
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,409
if I go across and latitude you're

246
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,999
somewhere over here on the East Coast

247
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:09,829
right if you went swimming out here it's

248
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:12,859
pretty Pleasant it's nice and warm if

249
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:15,019
you go exact cold the same latitude and

250
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,209
come over here and go swimming off the

251
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:20,449
coast of let's say Los Angeles or San

252
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:22,519
Diego you find out it's actually really

253
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,139
cold and this shocks tourists because

254
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,669
they think about Southern California and

255
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,529
sunny and there's surfers and all this

256
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:29,749
and they get out in the ocean like holy

257
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,609
crap it's cold because that water was

258
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,399
actually just recently at the bottom of

259
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:38,329
the ocean and it's coming up to the

260
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,929
surface as is all along this part of

261
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:44,779
South America okay this is all deep cold

262
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:48,409
water coming to the surface okay

263
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,600
well it turns out that besides the water

264
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:53,449
being cold it has a lot of nutrients in

265
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,309
it things die out in the ocean and as a

266
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:58,759
little things die and they fall down

267
00:12:55,309 --> 00:13:00,229
that kind of sets up a food chain when

268
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,689
that water comes back up to the surface

269
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:04,699
it's got nutrients in it little

270
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:06,559
microorganisms eat that and bigger

271
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:08,239
things eat the microorganism and so on

272
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,249
and so forth and tell you finally you

273
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:15,289
get to fish and so the fish actually

274
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,240
most of the fish in the ocean live near

275
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:19,570
the continents in

276
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,390
zones with the cold upwelling water the

277
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,010
fish like the cold water it has all the

278
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,589
things that they want to eat in it and

279
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,740
so most of the fish Fisheries in the

280
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,740
world are kind of up in here up here and

281
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,430
other places were where this happens

282
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,130
okay so go back a few thousand years and

283
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,920
you've got people that are living all up

284
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,800
and down South America okay so you have

285
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,459
to imagine in what's now modern-day

286
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,370
Chile and Peru people living up and down

287
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:52,750
the coasts now we didn't really talk

288
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,529
about this at the time but when we

289
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,200
talked about rainshadow the there are

290
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:00,940
the Andes that are right along in here

291
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,080
let me just sketch that out real quick

292
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:07,120
so the Andes are mountain chain right

293
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,790
through here and they're very you know

294
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,330
it's a tall chain of volcanoes and the

295
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:17,709
storms that come in come in this

296
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:19,870
direction so a storm that comes in dumps

297
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,250
its rain in the Amazon basin and goes up

298
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,649
and up and up and up and up and up and

299
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,560
then goes downhill on the other side and

300
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,570
this is a very extreme rain shadow

301
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,610
okay there's there are areas here it

302
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,589
literally has not rained in over ten

303
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,089
years okay some of it's called the

304
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,300
Atacama Desert you may have heard of

305
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,839
that

306
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:41,260
so these early people that lived along

307
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,089
the coast here if you want protein you

308
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,860
really only have one option and that's

309
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:46,540
to get fish because this so dry is

310
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,410
really hard to grow much of anything

311
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,970
so fishing became a livelihood for all

312
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,670
the people that lived here and they kept

313
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,630
records so for those people that lived

314
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,500
along this west coast of South America

315
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,120
you had to make your living as a

316
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,360
fisherman okay that was just the way it

317
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,790
was well they noticed once in a while

318
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,029
they would go out in their boats and

319
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:12,339
this would happen maybe kind of around

320
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,690
Christmastime near the end of the year

321
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:18,940
and they would go out and they would

322
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:24,100
notice that actually this zone right in

323
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:27,610
here the water was unusually warm right

324
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:31,360
through here and they would notice

325
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,270
the fish were gone and this was a

326
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,510
disaster because they depended on the

327
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:40,890
fish and the fish wanted the cold water

328
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,270
in the cold water had disappeared and

329
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,190
they didn't know what causes this but

330
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:48,190
they all they seemed to notice that this

331
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,740
often seemed to happen when he got close

332
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:55,120
to Christmas and they called this event

333
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,940
El Nino and El Nino for them bad news

334
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,980
because once they once they encountered

335
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,160
this warm water and the lack of fish

336
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,840
this was gonna last for months and as

337
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,730
possible people were going to starve

338
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,610
because he couldn't catch fish maybe for

339
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,220
six months or more this is where the

340
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,400
name El Nino comes from and they named

341
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,620
it that because of association with time

342
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,750
of year at Christmas and baby Jesus and

343
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:25,540
all that good stuff and so that's where

344
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:29,620
El Nino actually gets its name so what

345
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:31,540
caused that now what we now know today

346
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,450
and they did not know this back then is

347
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,870
that something is going to shut this

348
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,330
whole circulation system down the Easter

349
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,240
bees are gonna die the easterlies die

350
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:46,030
the warm water moves back across the

351
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,820
ocean as the mourn water moves back

352
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:52,240
across the ocean the upwelling dies when

353
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,640
the upwelling dies the cold water stops

354
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,770
coming to the surface when the cold

355
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,210
water stops coming to the surface the

356
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,450
fish go somewhere I don't know exactly

357
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:05,050
where they go but they but they leave

358
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,870
that's El Nino so to explain this I'm

359
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:11,520
going to show a couple animations that

360
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:14,110
explain what an El Nino event looks like

361
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,199
so this is a simple little animation

362
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:19,089
that just explains first we're going to

363
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,660
look at what I just talked about which

364
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:26,050
is not El Nino not Lenina but just a

365
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,780
normal condition so here is going to

366
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,820
show this is a cross-section through the

367
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,710
ocean and the warm part of the water is

368
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:37,060
this upper part and here's our

369
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,600
easterlies also known as the trades and

370
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:43,059
they're blowing from east to west

371
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,730
and they're gonna pull up the warm water

372
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,350
over here and you're going to get rising

373
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,530
air because you got this big pool of

374
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,510
warm water and that's going to create a

375
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,650
relatively low pressure and so that's

376
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,330
what they're showing here and a lot of

377
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,630
precipitation rains over here every day

378
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,789
and there is also air kind of sinking

379
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,070
back out here that's making it high and

380
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:05,590
this is called the Walker circulation

381
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,919
cell now what they're trying to show

382
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:12,760
here are those coastal winds from the

383
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:15,039
gyre coming up the coast and here's the

384
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,289
upwelling so they're trying to show the

385
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,230
here comes that cold water and it comes

386
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:24,700
up to the surface and then it gets

387
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:26,650
pushed along the equator here and then

388
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,169
you have this pool of relatively warm

389
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,510
water over here now the animator got

390
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:33,490
this wrong because you saw that the the

391
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:37,360
warm water it started creeping in from

392
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,070
the west over here which is not right we

393
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,780
said that the warm water was pushed

394
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,419
across the ocean this way so they got

395
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,120
that wrong but this is kind of to show

396
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:49,000
what I I just talked about there should

397
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,000
be not just cold water along the coast

398
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:58,240
but a little bit along the equator here

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,179
okay so we can see this I go back okay

400
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,299
so now we're back to what kind of sea

401
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:07,480
surface temperatures alright so notice

402
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:10,630
this you've got this yellow this cooler

403
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,510
water and there's this ribbon of yellow

404
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,730
kind of along the equator that's cooler

405
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,230
water that's being pulled up from the

406
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,730
upwelling the upwelling is happening

407
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:23,950
down here and then it's being kind of

408
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,010
pulled along with the easterlies you can

409
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,409
see the direction of the currents here

410
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:32,830
being essentially pushed pushed to the

411
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:34,270
to the west over here so that's why it's

412
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,970
weird that you've got some of the

413
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,650
coldest water around here is right along

414
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,270
the equator where you'd expect it to be

415
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,480
the warmest because the winds are

416
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,919
pushing this cold water along here okay

417
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,650
so that's our upwelling so I'm going to

418
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,650
add that to our diagram

419
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:59,899
so we've got this ribbon of cool water

420
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:04,909
kind of like in here which are just

421
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:07,429
shade so just to be clear we've got cool

422
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:10,789
water along the coast we got cool water

423
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:13,789
along the coast down here and the

424
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:15,620
easterlies are pushing that along the

425
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:19,880
equator so we have this ribbon a fairly

426
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:23,389
cold air okay so this is not El Nino

427
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,409
this is a normal year okay alright so

428
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:28,549
now we're going to go back to the

429
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:30,740
animation okay so this is where we left

430
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:32,750
off the animation so let's see what

431
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,720
happens in an El Nino so the El Nino

432
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,510
animation is gonna start from this point

433
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:43,279
which is a normal year okay so here we

434
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:45,889
are now what happens is those winds the

435
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:49,549
Tradewinds the easterlies they die down

436
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:53,210
for some reason and in fact they might

437
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:55,399
even reverse and so the ocean starts to

438
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,980
slosh back across the equator this big

439
00:20:55,399 --> 00:21:01,220
pool of warm water works its way back

440
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:04,970
across the ocean that upwelling stops

441
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,950
and instead of having cold water here

442
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:10,909
and cold water along the equator you

443
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:13,970
have relatively warm water also that

444
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,950
these two pressure centers reversed so

445
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,289
now you've got more of a low pressure

446
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,880
over here and more of a high pressure

447
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:23,149
over here so these guys are now

448
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:28,010
relatively dry and these guys are

449
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:32,870
relatively wet so this whole system that

450
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:35,960
is now referred to as El Nino so trade

451
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:38,809
winds or easterly's die warm water

452
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,700
sloshes back across the ocean upwelling

453
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:43,309
stops you've got warm water along this

454
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,090
coast on this coast and along the

455
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,899
equator we didn't have it before that's

456
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:53,779
El Nino

457
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:55,760
now what's La Nina aw Nina we're gonna

458
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:59,960
start again from a normal year so this

459
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,970
is a normal year and what happens in a

460
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,750
La Nina is that the trade winds get

461
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,580
stronger

462
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,820
so this is their showing the arrows here

463
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,460
getting kind of fatter so the wind is

464
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,220
blowing the the easterlies I was blowing

465
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,440
harder than they were this makes more

466
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,900
upwelling than we used to have that

467
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,360
blows the cold water further along the

468
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,670
equator towards the west and you'll see

469
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,860
that this pool of warm water shrinks a

470
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:27,950
little bit and this pool of cold water

471
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:31,040
grows a little bit that's a long mean

472
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:33,620
iya condition now we know from these

473
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,330
from these chili and fishermen and they

474
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,890
kept records for I don't remember how

475
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,410
far back but several hundred years that

476
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,820
this is a naturally occurring thing so

477
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,220
this was happening on earth long before

478
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:46,520
humans were having any effect on the

479
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,410
climate and it would happen maybe every

480
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,530
five or six or seven years they would

481
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:55,460
have one of these El Nino events and so

482
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:58,070
it's a naturally occurring thing and for

483
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,140
the most part we can't really predict it

484
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,710
the way we predict it is we actually

485
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:07,610
have if I go back to my El Nino here so

486
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:11,360
I deposit so if an El Nino is coming and

487
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:14,210
we have some like ships out here our

488
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,880
buoys with thermometers in them or maybe

489
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,520
we can see this from satellites we can

490
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,620
watch we can notice that when this warm

491
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,870
water starts to creep across the ocean

492
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,750
right so if an El Nino is going to

493
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:29,330
happen we can we can detect this warm

494
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,310
water on the move before it actually

495
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,800
gets to the coast so we can predict it

496
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,930
that way but we have no way of saying oh

497
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,820
next years in El Nino or the year after

498
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,490
that as an El Nino we can't we can't do

499
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,620
that is this is not a predictable

500
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,780
process when an El Nino happens it

501
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,400
happens

502
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,820
several this condition lasts for several

503
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,980
months so it's not really weather and

504
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,260
it's not really climate it's kind of in

505
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,330
between right it's a little bit it kind

506
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,670
of bridges the gap between climate and

507
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,440
weather it's a process that occur that

508
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,430
will change the weather for several

509
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,970
months at a time

510
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,910
so El Nino is one of the two phases was

511
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,250
the other being Lonnie Nia we generally

512
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:14,260
refer to both of these two together as

513
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:17,080
ENSO El Nino Southern Oscillation

514
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:20,169
the Southern Oscillation refers to these

515
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,020
two pressure centers that swapped so

516
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:25,809
again this right here this is a well

517
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,179
we've a normal year not El Nino not La

518
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:32,230
Nina we've got a lo over here we've got

519
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:34,360
a hi over here and in the El Nino one of

520
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,350
the things that happened is that these

521
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,790
two pressure centers swapped places

522
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:42,280
that's what we call the Southern

523
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,020
Oscillation okay that's what it refers

524
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,480
to and we're not going to get too deep

525
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,580
in this class about what all that means

526
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,200
except to say that that's what the name

527
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,110
comes from so they'll hear this term and

528
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,530
so when you hear and so just think El

529
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:58,570
Nino and La Nina together like it

530
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,760
changes between one and the other from

531
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:04,690
year to year but collectively we just

532
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,460
called this thing in soul so before we

533
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,230
move on to the effects that El Nino has

534
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,540
on our weather I want to point out a

535
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:14,799
couple other things with the SST maps so

536
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:18,340
when we talk about El Nino La Nina

537
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:21,220
events is only happening in the Pacific

538
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,950
Ocean so apparently the Atlantic Ocean

539
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,540
is too small now it has there's

540
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,360
something similar going on here there's

541
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,890
some upwelling here there's you can see

542
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,770
this ribbon of cool water along the

543
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,630
equator here but when we talk about Long

544
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,179
Nina and El Nino events it doesn't

545
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,160
really seem to affect the Atlantic Ocean

546
00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:40,570
it's only the Pacific Ocean where all

547
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,890
this stuff happens

548
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:46,840
yeah thing I want to point out is we

549
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:50,140
also have some interesting ocean

550
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,720
currents in our part of the world so

551
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,190
here's the Gulf of Mexico and again this

552
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,440
is a day in the summer so we have

553
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,620
especially warm water here in the Gulf

554
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:03,309
of Mexico and I want you to notice this

555
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:05,710
this stream this current coming out of

556
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:08,980
the Gulf that's called the Gulf Stream

557
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,770
and if we kind of fall or it goes

558
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,570
there's this ribbon of warm water that

559
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:16,450
there's a bunch of Eddie's and stuff and

560
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,690
it makes its way across the Atlantic

561
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:24,580
Ocean and if I kind of look at the big

562
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:26,590
scale here really warm water is coming

563
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,590
out of the Gulf of Mexico comes up the

564
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,799
East Coast

565
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:35,419
and it heads out to sea and it ends up

566
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:37,400
actually over here by Europe so this

567
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:41,090
part of the ocean right here it's see

568
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,940
it's relatively kind of yellow in color

569
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:47,380
compared to over here where you've got

570
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:51,140
this colder green and blue colors so

571
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:54,850
this part of the ocean is being kept

572
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,830
warmer because there is a current of

573
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,600
warm water that's basically stealing our

574
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:02,330
warm water from the Gulf of Mexico and

575
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,610
pumps it out here and dumps it out in

576
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,250
this part of the ocean now this is

577
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,890
important because for people that live

578
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,380
in Europe if you think about the related

579
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,409
to it here right right right here if you

580
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,360
follow this line of latitude across okay

581
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:22,460
you're in the that would be equivalent

582
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:26,210
to the middle of the United States what

583
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:30,789
if you went up say to this one

584
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:34,429
okay so there's UK and all that there

585
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:39,830
follow this one across and you're in

586
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:41,630
Canada right so what's what are the

587
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:45,500
winners like in this in the middle of

588
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:48,409
Canada well very very cold but they're

589
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,370
not nearly so cold over here in Europe

590
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:54,320
even though it's the same latitude why

591
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,899
because this body of water that this

592
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,179
part of the Atlantic Ocean is warmer

593
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,549
than it would be if it wasn't for the

594
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:04,520
Gulf Stream the Gulf Stream takes this

595
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:07,880
warm water brings it up dumps into this

596
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:11,809
part of the ocean keeps Europe warmer

597
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:15,710
than the normally would be in fact if

598
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:18,350
you shut this off somehow Europe would

599
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,419
be much much colder in fact it would it

600
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:23,929
would look similar to what it looked

601
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:25,940
like in the last ice age so when we get

602
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:28,669
to climate change which is a couple

603
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,760
weeks away one of the things we're going

604
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:36,080
to talk about is the possibility that

605
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,780
this stream might shut down and if it

606
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,030
shuts down that's going to make Europe a

607
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,510
whole lot colder okay so that's a little

608
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,150
counter

609
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,920
to ative when we talk about the worth

610
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,140
getting warmer why could why could

611
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,400
Europe suddenly get colder has to do

612
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,380
with this I just want to point it out

613
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,990
now because that's what we're talking

614
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,480
about so if we have an El Nino or La

615
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:00,020
Nina event we can get some really

616
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,180
radical changes in the weather and ocean

617
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,120
temperatures depending on where you live

618
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,820
so for example these guys are catching

619
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,980
tropical fish off the coast of Southern

620
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,630
California now we just said that the

621
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,670
water off the coast of California is

622
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,640
really cold because it's from the bottom

623
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:19,220
of the ocean but during it El Nino that

624
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,790
up whittling stops in that warm water

625
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,830
sloshes back across the ocean and the

626
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,510
tropical fish follow of that and so

627
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,970
these guys are catching tropical fish in

628
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:32,240
a place which normally really cold water

629
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:34,100
a lot of times animals just can't handle

630
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,480
the changes in water temperature so

631
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,250
these are zillions of dead crabs that

632
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,260
couldn't handle the warmer water of El

633
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:45,850
Nino and again we were in California

634
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:48,890
they washed ashore here by the millions

635
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:51,800
and you gotta wonder how bad this smells

636
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:54,140
after a few days of this but during an

637
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,600
El Nino that sudden change in

638
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,310
temperature can really kill a lot of

639
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,880
animals that are that have adapted to

640
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:03,380
growing in an environment with you know

641
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,260
pretty cold water like I said it's

642
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,090
usually not - not too much warmer than

643
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,310
freezing most of the time and suddenly

644
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,070
you have this warm tropical water and a

645
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:17,480
lot of animals can't handle that now

646
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:20,420
the El Nino event itself or La Nina is

647
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,740
affecting this area right near the ocean

648
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:26,600
or near the equator and you'd expect

649
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,750
well the the weather through here will

650
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,420
probably be different because of this

651
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:35,960
but what you may not expect is that this

652
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,880
a change in an event down here triggers

653
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,330
all kinds of changes of weather all over

654
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,580
the world so here's a map showing the

655
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:47,750
types of weather changes that occur

656
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:51,350
during an El Nino and in the winter so

657
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,510
December January February so just to

658
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,389
reiterate when we have an El Nino or La

659
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,929
Nina it lasts for several

660
00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:01,450
okay so it may last six months or eight

661
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,059
months or four months and so during that

662
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:07,479
time it will have effects on the weather

663
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:11,019
so for example you may not be able to

664
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:15,009
quite quite read the key down here but

665
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:16,929
along the equator it says warm and wet

666
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:18,729
okay that makes sense in a nil ninu

667
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:22,450
you've got warm water sloshing across

668
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:24,459
that should make it warmer and give you

669
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:28,119
more precipitation but then for example

670
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:32,969
up here it says it's going to be warmer

671
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:35,649
or warmer and drier or places where the

672
00:31:32,969 --> 00:31:38,619
precipitation increases and notice

673
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:40,929
what's happening over here we've got a

674
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:43,059
green zone that says wetter that we've

675
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:48,389
got a kind of a bluer zone that says

676
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:50,919
cool and wet so this change here is

677
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:54,369
affecting things all over the planet and

678
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,809
for us as in New Mexico wearing this

679
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:58,049
green blob so we're going to explain

680
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:02,459
that in a little bit

681
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:05,709
now here's El Nino June July August and

682
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:07,539
notice that we see some changes in

683
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:09,369
different parts of the world right so

684
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:11,589
down here it's cool and dry or

685
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:15,909
what-have-you but notice that for the

686
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:17,799
most part not much as changing in North

687
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:21,159
America in general and especially not in

688
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:24,099
the United States so for us if we have

689
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,739
an El Nino it affects our winter

690
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:27,879
precipitation in our winter temperatures

691
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:30,579
and we'll talk more about that in a

692
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:33,369
second does not seem to affect us in the

693
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:37,089
summer okay so keep that in mind that El

694
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:41,229
Nino really affects our winter time if

695
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:43,839
we have a log in yeah again that's gonna

696
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:45,639
make this you know the definition of La

697
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,669
Nina is the is the winds here or

698
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:51,339
blooming stronger from the east which

699
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:53,109
makes this colder okay so if it's colder

700
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:55,929
you'd expect to be cooler and drier that

701
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:58,419
makes sense but it also has effects all

702
00:32:55,929 --> 00:33:01,539
over the world so for example up in here

703
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:04,269
it says it's making it wetter and down

704
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:05,950
here it's making it drier okay and so

705
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:07,929
we're also you know we're kind of

706
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,190
getting up here here in New Mexico or

707
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:11,740
it's gonna have some kind

708
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:14,500
for us to which we'll talk about in a

709
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,690
second so the point is you're only

710
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,669
changing this but somehow it's having

711
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,000
effects all over the planet

712
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:24,299
so why might this be the situation Owen

713
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,230
before I forget if I look at anemia

714
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:31,179
again in the summer we see really

715
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,690
nothing changing here in the United

716
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,740
States

717
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:37,809
okay so El Nino or La Nina doesn't

718
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,890
really affect our summer weather at

719
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:44,100
least not that we've been able to

720
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:48,760
determine does affect our winter weather

721
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,440
so how is it that the change in the

722
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,380
temperature along down here by the

723
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,049
equator can have effects all over the

724
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,700
planet short answer is it's really

725
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:59,889
complicated but there's one thing that

726
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,559
we can learn about in this class that

727
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:04,899
we've talked about before so we talked

728
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,990
about the polar front right so let's

729
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:11,889
imagine the polar front is going kind of

730
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,359
feel like this on a normal year so to

731
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,349
remind you the cold air is up here the

732
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,960
warmer is down here in the middle

733
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:18,820
latitude cyclones basically follow this

734
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,859
path and that's always changing right

735
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,540
there's these curves and the whole thing

736
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:25,000
we've talked about with the rows be

737
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,639
waves but in general the storms are kind

738
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,669
of coming in through this direction now

739
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:35,169
let's say we have an El Nino so an El

740
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:39,220
Nino means that we have warmer than

741
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:43,379
usual temperatures here and here and

742
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:48,060
here all right this is in an El Nino

743
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:53,800
warmer than normal

744
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:56,830
okay so I just write this out here okay

745
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:01,720
so in an El Nino event it's warmer than

746
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:06,190
normal now the the fact that there is a

747
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:09,130
pool of warmer water here will cause the

748
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:14,320
polar front to shift positions a little

749
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:17,910
bit and it will actually shift a little

750
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,910
further to the south

751
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,110
I'm exaggerating this greatly just to

752
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,210
make a point

753
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:30,330
so the polar front shifts a little

754
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:33,780
further south during an El Nino winter

755
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:36,120
than a normal winter so if we think

756
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,260
about mid latitude cyclones right the

757
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:43,170
mid-latitude cyclones are forming along

758
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:46,710
the polar front where are they going to

759
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:50,090
go well during an El Nino because the

760
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:54,000
polar front shifts further south then

761
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:58,860
the mid-latitude cyclones shift further

762
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,280
south so what that means is in a non El

763
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:04,350
Nino year just a normal year you'd

764
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,750
expect the mid-latitude cyclones to kind

765
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,850
of be following say the path of the

766
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:12,360
Green Line coming up into the Pacific

767
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:14,430
Northwest but an El Nino year this whole

768
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,290
thing will be shifted down and the

769
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,110
Pacific sub I'm sorry the mid-latitude

770
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:22,110
cyclones will be traveling further south

771
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:26,850
well what's further south of this Green

772
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:29,670
Line well we are so US as in New Mexico

773
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:32,880
we'll be in a position where we are more

774
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:36,120
likely to get mid-latitude cyclones than

775
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,620
in a normal non El Nino year okay so

776
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,810
this is gonna have an effect on our

777
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,530
weather because it's shifting the polar

778
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:49,910
front south okay so let's look at a

779
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:49,910
couple maps here so here is a couple of

780
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,200
cartoons to try to illustrate this and

781
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,970
they're using some slightly different

782
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,750
terminology than what we've been using

783
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:04,350
so so far we've been talking about the

784
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:06,570
Jetstream and one type of polar front is

785
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:08,580
actually it splits there's more than one

786
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,380
type of jet I don't want to get too deep

787
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,290
into this but what they're trying to

788
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,020
show here is in an El Nino this

789
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:21,240
Jetstream what I'm calling the polar

790
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:23,190
front is bringing in storms kind of

791
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,850
right through here within this orange

792
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:30,090
line which is going to make this area

793
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:31,890
wetter than normal in this area warmer

794
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,720
and drier than normal

795
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:39,359
so the storms that we're coming up here

796
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:43,039
are now coming further south in a La

797
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:47,420
Nina the opposite happens in a La Nina

798
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:50,039
the jet polar the polar front again is

799
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,369
shifted further to the north so it's

800
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:56,700
exactly the opposite and the storms tend

801
00:37:53,369 --> 00:38:01,400
to go further to the north and skip us

802
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:06,359
more often so we end up to be drier and

803
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,529
they end up to be wetter okay so what

804
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:09,210
we're doing is we're shifting the

805
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:12,720
location of where those mid-latitude

806
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:14,700
cyclones come in in an El Nino they tend

807
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,609
to come further south they make us

808
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:21,749
wetter in a La Nina it's in to go

809
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:23,670
further north make us drier so that's

810
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:27,029
going to have an effect on our overall

811
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,890
winter weather so this is a new type of

812
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:32,489
map we haven't seen in this class yeah

813
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:34,160
it's called an anomaly map anomaly means

814
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:38,489
something that's different than normal

815
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:42,029
so these colors this is a says composite

816
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:44,130
precipitation anomalies and what they've

817
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:46,769
done is they've every time there was an

818
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,839
El Nino they looked at all the

819
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:51,359
precipitation records for that El Nino

820
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:53,509
event and they compared it to what the

821
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,859
average precipitation was in the past

822
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:58,890
okay so what they've noticed is that the

823
00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:01,579
places that are blue so it says five

824
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,980
case what does that mean that means that

825
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:08,369
during the winter voices that are dark

826
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,279
blue on average got five inches of

827
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:14,119
precipitation more than they normally

828
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:17,430
would that's an anomaly

829
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:22,369
whereas places that are say yellow or

830
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:27,029
orange got - one - two - three inches

831
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:29,309
from normal so this isn't telling you

832
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:32,880
how much precipitation they received

833
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:36,359
it's telling you how much extra or how

834
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,390
much less they got than what they

835
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,670
normally expect right so everyone

836
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,069
everybody that's in on this side and

837
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,480
these green and aqua colors are getting

838
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:48,420
more precipitation

839
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,200
than a normal year you know see that New

840
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:55,559
Mexico is right in here so we get about

841
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,059
one inch more than normal during an El

842
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,270
Ninos again this is spread out

843
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:02,160
throughout the whole winter right why is

844
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,140
that because the mid-latitude cyclones

845
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,059
are being directed further south so they

846
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,760
come in they dumped a lot in California

847
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,829
then they kind of moved downstream

848
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,630
towards us and we pick up some of that

849
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:18,780
extra precipitation now these guys are

850
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:21,839
in the red you can see the - three -

851
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,549
four - five inches these guys are

852
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,680
getting less precipitation than they

853
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:28,109
normally would because the storms that

854
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,950
used to come in here are now shifted

855
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:34,680
further south so weather El Nino is good

856
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:38,160
or bad depends on where you live let's

857
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,559
say you're a skier right well if your

858
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,900
skier in New Mexico you're happy when

859
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,210
they'll Nino happens we get more snow if

860
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,549
you're a skier in Washington State

861
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:50,790
you're sad when El Nino happens because

862
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:53,970
you have less snow now this is an

863
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:57,510
anomaly map so this is different than

864
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:59,880
average so it does not mean the red does

865
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:03,630
not mean that they are drier than we are

866
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,180
this is Washington state right so we get

867
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,940
eight inches of precipitation a year in

868
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:10,619
Albuquerque they get like 120 something

869
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,339
like that this is saying that there's

870
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:16,710
five inches less than their normal but

871
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:20,069
their normal is way bigger than our no

872
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,359
more our normal so keep in mind this

873
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:23,450
doesn't mean that they're dry and we're

874
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,490
wet that means they're drier than normal

875
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:30,559
this means we're wetter than normal okay

876
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:33,720
so that's how you read an anomaly map so

877
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,940
temperature-wise there can be there is a

878
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,250
difference - so if this if the

879
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,900
mid-latitude cyclones are coming further

880
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,960
south and they're going across the

881
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,000
southern United States we're gonna have

882
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,530
more cloudy days and that's going to

883
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,920
lower the temperature a couple of

884
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:52,020
degrees these guys are gonna have more

885
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,780
sunny days and so they're gonna have

886
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,400
temperatures a couple degrees greater

887
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,440
than average right so in an El Nino

888
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,400
winter again all these maps are for

889
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,770
winter

890
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,079
does not seem to affect our summer we

891
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,420
have a wetter than normal winter we have

892
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,359
a cooler than normal winter these guys

893
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:11,670
have a drier than normal winter and a

894
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,650
warmer than normal winter for an El Nino

895
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:19,109
La Nina everything's flipped almost so

896
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:21,210
the storms are concentrated to come up

897
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:24,990
and here more than they do and they miss

898
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:27,450
us almost completely and so here we have

899
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:31,400
you know negative 1 negative 2 negative

900
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:34,349
3 inches again over the whole winter

901
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,990
that's that would be 1 2 or 3 inches

902
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:39,960
less than what we normally get

903
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:42,059
so if you notice so so Albuquerque is in

904
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,190
this one right here and that's somewhere

905
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,710
between negative 2 and negative 3 inches

906
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:50,640
so that means that during a lawn Nino

907
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:52,980
winter we expect 2 to 3 inches below

908
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,230
normal precipitation

909
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,450
well how much precipitation do we

910
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:01,559
normally get throughout the whole winter

911
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:05,279
in New Mexico maybe like two inches so

912
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:08,760
two inches minus two is zero so when we

913
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:09,960
have a long Nina it often often results

914
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,930
in the winter that's almost completely

915
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:18,240
dry so we in the southwest hate anaemia

916
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:19,799
because it means the area of the country

917
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,900
that's already really dry

918
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:24,000
remember that Pacific subtropical high

919
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,210
we've been talking about makes this

920
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,730
whole area desert well in a Lonnie Mia

921
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:31,770
winter it gets worse because now the

922
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,809
storms are missing us even more than

923
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:35,700
often they're going up here and we're

924
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:37,500
even drier again weaken it

925
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,319
there are winters on record where it

926
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,770
literally did not produce any measurable

927
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,720
precipitation during the la Nino on the

928
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,190
other hand these guys are getting footed

929
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,319
because now they're getting way more

930
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,670
storms and they normally get they're

931
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:53,339
already used to a lot of precipitation

932
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:55,380
because it's Pacific Northwest but now

933
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,299
they're getting even more so you can see

934
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,029
they're getting you know excess of 5

935
00:43:57,299 --> 00:44:04,770
inches above what they normally expect

936
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:06,829
for their winter now there's a

937
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:09,750
temperature anomaly but it doesn't quite

938
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:11,760
match up like you might expect in

939
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,520
general this part of the country is

940
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,580
warmer than

941
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,200
in Oh anemia you might think we would be

942
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,780
too but for some reason it doesn't ever

943
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,700
seem to work out that way so most of New

944
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,820
Mexico's temperatures don't change that

945
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,890
much with a la anemia but up in the

946
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:29,490
Pacific Northwest and actually all these

947
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:32,140
northern states up here are usually

948
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:34,780
having cooler than normal winter

949
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:39,010
temperatures so we're going to look at

950
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,170
another use of the anomaly map and this

951
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,330
is says weekly average sea surface

952
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,300
temperature anomaly so what that means

953
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:48,940
is everywhere that's the yellow and

954
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,030
orange and red colors correspond the

955
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:54,940
places where the ocean is warmer than it

956
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:56,410
normally is so for this location it's

957
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,830
warmer than average

958
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:02,290
what's average usually 30 years places

959
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:05,440
that are blue are cooler than their

960
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:08,410
average so realize how you have to

961
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,260
interpret an anomaly map right here is a

962
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:14,020
blob of water that's warmer than their

963
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:17,160
average right here a blob of water

964
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,660
that's cooler than their average but

965
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,450
this is that part of the ocean I said

966
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,460
was always the warmest part right so the

967
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,870
pool of water right here is really

968
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,690
really warm all the time

969
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:31,600
it's always going to be warmer than

970
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,890
whatever is down here so you can't get

971
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,050
confused and think that oh this is

972
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:37,390
warmer because it's more orange no no

973
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:40,840
that means it's warmer than average and

974
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:43,840
this is cooler than average but their

975
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,790
average is still way warmer than theirs

976
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,100
okay so you can't compare direct

977
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:50,410
temperatures in an anomaly map you can

978
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:54,010
only look at differences from average

979
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:56,290
okay so we're in 1982 this was a El Nino

980
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,970
year and this is gonna become an

981
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,080
animation and you're gonna see the weeks

982
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:05,020
click by and what we're looking for are

983
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:07,600
colors around the equator here that show

984
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:10,780
that the ocean is warmer than average

985
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:16,480
and if we see that we know we have an El

986
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:18,040
Nino ok so watch right in here and you

987
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,980
see those orange colors come and go

988
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,350
right there that's the El Nino right

989
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,550
through here so that's a location in the

990
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,220
ocean that's far warmer

991
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:31,090
normal that's what happens during an El

992
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,510
Nino because the up lowing shuts off

993
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:37,250
okay

994
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:39,560
a similar situation now our 1999 this is

995
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:42,800
a La Nina and we can see the Von Nina

996
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,480
occurring already it's this dark blue

997
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,520
color so that's where places that's

998
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,000
where the ocean is colder than normal

999
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,980
and so in a La Nina we expect exactly

1000
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,620
the opposite that what we just saw we

1001
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,150
expect to see blue colors along here and

1002
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,610
you can watch when start the animation

1003
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:02,770
you can watch how it'll kind of grow

1004
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:06,440
back and forth here along the equator

1005
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:09,200
okay so there's the the blue goes away a

1006
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:13,340
little bit comes back a little bit so

1007
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:17,630
this is one La Nina event right through

1008
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:20,660
there okay so the ocean can go back and

1009
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:23,600
forth between El Nino and La Nina from

1010
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:26,150
year to year and a lot of years is not

1011
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,550
in either one and so there's been some

1012
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:31,880
attempts to try to describe how strong

1013
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:33,560
an El Nino or La Nina is and so here's

1014
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,160
one example it's called the ocean Nino

1015
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:42,770
index also known as the El Nino index or

1016
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:45,500
the ENSO index so here is so on the

1017
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:49,130
x-axis we have time right so this is

1018
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:53,450
January 2004 January 2005 each one of

1019
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:56,900
these marks is another year okay so if

1020
00:47:53,450 --> 00:48:00,140
you have one of these Peaks that's on

1021
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:03,200
the the red part of the graph that was

1022
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,670
an El Nino if you have a peak in the

1023
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,120
blue part of the graph that's a La Nina

1024
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:10,430
and the higher the peak the stronger

1025
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:13,100
event so this is a very strong El Nino

1026
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:15,770
right here this is a very strong El Nino

1027
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:18,710
right here these would be considered El

1028
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:21,470
Ninos but they're pretty weak these are

1029
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:24,830
pretty strong long Nina's and these are

1030
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,780
pretty weak ones so a lot of years if

1031
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:28,460
you have a little peak like that one or

1032
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,770
that one or that one

1033
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:33,170
you'd be say this is an in so neutral

1034
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:34,220
year it's a little bit and the long mean

1035
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,610
they're a little bit in the El Nino

1036
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:39,300
direction but not enough to count in

1037
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,520
some way years you've got these weak

1038
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:44,850
Vence and then some years we have these

1039
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,040
strong events and some years we have a

1040
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:50,720
couple years in a row of the same thing

1041
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,930
so for example here there was one winter

1042
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,060
8687

1043
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:57,300
which was in El Nino and then the next

1044
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:59,280
year after that even stronger El Nino so

1045
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:03,150
think about what that would do for New

1046
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,230
Mexico's precipitation El Nino year wet

1047
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,110
winter right

1048
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:09,140
so we likely had two winners in a row

1049
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,760
that had an above average precipitation

1050
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,520
on the other hand look at what happened

1051
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,060
here La Nina

1052
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,020
anemia and then really wimpy La Nina

1053
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:22,740
followed after that but this whole time

1054
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:26,790
in here the ocean is in a La Nina State

1055
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:29,280
wanyan yeah dry winter so we're looking

1056
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:32,040
at two or three or maybe four years in a

1057
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,360
row where New Mexico would have had an a

1058
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,150
winter with below average precipitation

1059
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,980
and for us that's a big deal you got dry

1060
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:40,800
winter after dry winter after dry winter

1061
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:44,630
it adds up and you've got yourself you

1062
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,630
you're in a drought at that point

1063
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,360
you
