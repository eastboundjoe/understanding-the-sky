1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,050
hey this is Mel strong and in this

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,719
lecture we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,929
some of the major water projects of the

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,810
southwestern United States so the big

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,150
picture here is that if we look at a map

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,699
of precipitation for the US and we've

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,279
seen this map before there's this big

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,699
blob of orange and red colors here in

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,380
the southwest in if we just kind of drew

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,410
a circle kind of a right through around

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,899
there there's about 40 million people

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,260
living in the driest part of the country

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,410
and today's lecture is about how that is

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,320
possible so this is more of a history

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,190
and maybe a little bit of politics

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:53,430
lecture and less on science so before we

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,219
start just imagine the following imagine

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,890
if somebody came to you and said you can

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,469
continue living here in Albuquerque or

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,220
Arizona or wherever you live but the

21
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,390
deal is you can only have the water that

22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,600
fell from this guy

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,869
okay how easy would it be to live here I

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,030
mean it would be pretty tough to carve

25
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,110
out a living if you could only use the

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,380
water that actually fell as

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,119
precipitation right and yet we have the

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,640
system that you just turn on the faucet

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,030
boom water comes out it's a miracle

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,340
question is how did all that come to be

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,770
how does it work and when did it happen

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,650
and for most of the things we're talking

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,600
about today all of this happened before

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,880
any of us were born okay this is a

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,979
system that was that was started over a

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,220
hundred years ago people are still

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,420
working on it and we completely depend

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,360
on this for to live in in the driest

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,790
part of the country so we're gonna start

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:00,240
our story in Los Angeles in fact the big

41
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,430
motivating factor behind what we're

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,490
going to be talking about is population

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,459
growth so if you go back to 1900 okay

44
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,860
these are the state populations rights

45
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,239
under so New Mexico has you know under

46
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,410
two hundred thousand people in the whole

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,440
state

48
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,210
California has one-half million and if

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,760
you project forward when this paper came

50
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,350
out it was 2007 so a little over a

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,850
hundred years later you can see that

52
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,150
states like California

53
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,940
you know 36 million so their population

54
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,910
didn't just devil didn't quadruple it

55
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,310
didn't he wasn't even ten times it went

56
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,050
up twenty times right and you see that

57
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,790
in a lot of these states that the

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,790
population pretty much all these states

59
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,220
the populations increase by way more

60
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,380
than ten times in a hundred years so

61
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,060
you've got all these people living in an

62
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,860
area that's very very dry and so we're

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,060
gonna actually start our story in Los

64
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,500
Angeles we're in the late 1800s there

65
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,640
was just a few thousand people living

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,740
there and at the time there was a bunch

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,540
of real estate investors and they bought

68
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,310
up a bunch of land around Los Angeles

69
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,160
and they thought here's what we're gonna

70
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,200
do we're going to sell this place as a

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,030
great place to live and so they went up

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,880
to San Francisco in San Francisco at the

73
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,760
time was the biggest city along the west

74
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,440
coast it was this major port city we

75
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,020
just had the gold rush and all that and

76
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,880
so these real estate investors came in

77
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,730
and they said listen aren't you guys

78
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,130
tired of this cold crappy foggy San

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,230
Francisco weather well let me tell you

80
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,270
about a great place to live where it's

81
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,580
sunny almost every day it's called Los

82
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,430
Angeles and we've got some property to

83
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,860
sell you and this plan actually worked

84
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,450
in about 30 years

85
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,580
la goes from being a few thousand people

86
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,720
to over a hundred thousand people that

87
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,630
move there at the same time early 1900s

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,459
we start to get the very first movies

89
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,020
now today everybody knows where

90
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,050
Hollywood is Hollywood's in Southern

91
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,209
California that's the you know for a

92
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,489
long time has been the movie capital of

93
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,290
the world well why didn't it start there

94
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,790
right I give all the places in the world

95
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,030
or in the United States

96
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,100
why did Hollywood get set up there okay

97
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,290
so if you go back and you watch an old

98
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,410
timey movie like an old silent movie

99
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,900
with an indoor scene like this one so it

100
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,750
looks like they're filming this indoors

101
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,090
but actually there's no roof on this

102
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,919
this is natural light coming in these

103
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,410
old movies they didn't have artificial

104
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,220
lighting yet so the only way they could

105
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:38,340
film is if you had a sunny day so they

106
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,830
needed a place to to build their studios

107
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,440
where they could have as much natural

108
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:47,760
light as possible so they could film all

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,400
the time and so this area right down

110
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,240
here is a place that is sunny almost

111
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,780
every day of the year why is that review

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,750
question why is it so dry why is it so

113
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,110
neat I'm sorry so sunny over here well a

114
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,110
big reason is our old friend the Pacific

115
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,020
subtropical high right so the Pacific

116
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,840
subtropical high is responsible for why

117
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,320
Hollywood is where it is today because

118
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,250
that constant sinking air keeps the sky

119
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,260
clear allowed those old timey movies to

120
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,130
have natural lighting ok so that's how

121
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,380
it all got started

122
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,660
Pacific subtropical high all right so so

123
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,919
lady 200s we go from a few thousand

124
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,919
people to over a hundred thousand people

125
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,110
and at first the people that show up and

126
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,880
live in this area are getting water out

127
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,940
of the local rivers so there's something

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,510
called le river a few creeks that feed

129
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,710
it cases the map of it today and that

130
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,450
works for a little while if you have a

131
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,940
few thousand people but by the time you

132
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,580
get to a hundred thousand that's not

133
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,169
enough water to go around and so they

134
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,510
started to drill well so we're gonna

135
00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:01,620
talk a little bit here about groundwater

136
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:04,229
for a minute so below the ground there

137
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,770
exists a body of water in most places

138
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:10,740
and this water becomes replenished in

139
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:15,000
the winter so in this diagram you've got

140
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,880
some topography and this blue represents

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,860
water that has soaked in from above so

142
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,870
usually what happens in our part of the

143
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,200
world during the wet season like the

144
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,210
winter along the west coast rain will

145
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,580
fall and will soak down into the ground

146
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,820
and then what most people don't realize

147
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,620
is that the groundwater is actually

148
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,510
moving now the water table itself is is

149
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,330
this surface that's called the water

150
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,879
table and anytime you have a river

151
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,750
that's just where the water table

152
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:50,900
comes out onto the surface so here's an

153
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:53,639
idea here's a little diagram of this so

154
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,580
you get what are called recharge areas

155
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:00,419
these are areas where the precipitation

156
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,949
is added soaks down and then it's

157
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,449
actually on its way

158
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:04,949
you know it's moving downhill the water

159
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,439
underneath the ground is moving downhill

160
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:10,080
and ultimately it's headed to the ocean

161
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,240
okay now this shows it moving kind of

162
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,090
left and right towards these rivers but

163
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,159
it's also moving either in or out of the

164
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,870
slide depending on which way is towards

165
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:24,779
the ocean so what that means is if you

166
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,849
drill down far enough you could get

167
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,469
groundwater like this trying to show a

168
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:31,229
well that they didn't drill far enough

169
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:33,000
so it's dry here's one where some water

170
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:35,430
is kind of piled up here on this barrier

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,520
so that when they're getting water out

172
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,080
of point--is for most places in the

173
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,939
world you drill down you'll probably

174
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,690
eventually find some water okay you just

175
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:48,800
have to drill deep enough so they do

176
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:52,949
this in Los Angeles and this is a map of

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,080
200 large wells that are drilled in

178
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,909
lausanne in the Los Angeles area so

179
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,830
these are not like in your backyard

180
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,509
wells these are wells that are big

181
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,129
enough to supply water to a whole

182
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:04,650
neighborhood okay so they pump a lot of

183
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,300
water out of the ground well there's a

184
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,930
problem when you start to pump a lot of

185
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,300
water out of the ground so here's the

186
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,419
water table okay so here's some wells

187
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,909
and as they're pumping water out of the

188
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,669
ground you can see that the water table

189
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:22,800
lowers a little bit by each one of these

190
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,610
wells that's sometimes called a cone of

191
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,750
depression so here they've put in this

192
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,879
you know this is trying to show they put

193
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,300
in this new well here and they're going

194
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,430
to pump a lot and so it pulls down the

195
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,800
water table as they remove water out of

196
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,380
this big high-capacity well and these

197
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,789
guys there well went dry now because the

198
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,529
water table has been lowered

199
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,959
so basically mother nature cannot

200
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:50,100
replenish the groundwater as fast as the

201
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:52,110
humans are pulling it out okay so back

202
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,329
to the Los Angeles when they start

203
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,690
pulling the everybody starts printing in

204
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,060
well

205
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,610
at first people are able to pull water

206
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,750
out of the ground but as more and more

207
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,880
people do that

208
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,180
pretty soon the water table all starts

209
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,520
to go down the people wells start to go

210
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,180
dry and they have to read rill those

211
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:15,000
wells deeper and deeper so here is a

212
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,180
little graph of depth to the water table

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,760
okay so now this only starts in 1935 and

214
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,280
our story's starting back in the late

215
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,930
1800s and we don't really have any data

216
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,090
for that but just from 1935 to 1960 what

217
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,120
this is it says ground water elevation

218
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,430
feet from sea level so remember la is

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,190
pretty close to sea level okay so what

220
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,530
this means is back then if you drill

221
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,710
down til or a 60 feet above sea level

222
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,770
you hit ground water right but then if

223
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,960
you go ahead to 1945 you had to drill

224
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,030
down until was 40 feet above sea level

225
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,130
and then you had to drill down to sea

226
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,220
level and then you had to drill down to

227
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,490
60 feet below sea level so what's

228
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,660
happening from 1940 to 1960s he is blue

229
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,370
line here

230
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,590
people were have to drill deeper and

231
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,510
deeper and deeper holes just to get to

232
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,640
the groundwater because everybody was

233
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,480
pumping it out faster than mother nature

234
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,490
could replenish it so on average the

235
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,210
groundwater has drop in 8 feet per year

236
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:21,810
ok well they have an additional problem

237
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,760
in that if you so here's our little cone

238
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,220
of depression here if you pump down the

239
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,880
water table and you happen to live close

240
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,210
to the ocean then sea water will come in

241
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,430
and take the place of the fresh water so

242
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,260
normally before the well was drilled

243
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,600
there was fresh water that was coming

244
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,830
down and Sierra Nevadas in the case of

245
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,300
LA and migrating on this diagram from

246
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,480
left to right and then out into the

247
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,280
ocean so you had constant fresh water

248
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,530
moving underground but once you start

249
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,560
pumping it out and you start removing

250
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:58,440
the groundwater then salty water will

251
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,170
come back in and replace it and then

252
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,450
people start getting salt in their

253
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,310
groundwater so there's a limit as to how

254
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,680
much groundwater the people in the Los

255
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,220
Angeles could pump out before it started

256
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,970
to go Saul

257
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,270
okay so to recap they took water out of

258
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,670
the river network for a little while

259
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,490
then they started to pump wells that

260
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,320
will work for a little while but they

261
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,150
start to run out of water and realize

262
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,860
that this groundwater solution is only

263
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:31,890
temporary you can't keep pumping water

264
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:33,230
out of the ground okay so by 1900 again

265
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,790
we're about a hundred thousand people

266
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,760
there are they're already running into

267
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,090
trouble and they don't have enough well

268
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,170
water they don't have enough river water

269
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,060
what are they gonna do and all these

270
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,560
people have moved here right so this

271
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,090
whole campaign to get people to move

272
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,040
here in Hollywood and all that skin

273
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,810
going and it's clear that people that

274
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,330
want to live in Los Angeles but there's

275
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:59,850
not enough water so here on this map

276
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:01,590
here is LA and if you're in one if

277
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,410
you're in my class you had to do this

278
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,690
project trying to find some things on on

279
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,280
the map and one of the things that I

280
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,430
asked you to find was something called

281
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,080
Owens Lake okay and I have owns like

282
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,380
right up here with a little dashed line

283
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,850
so this is Lake that sits up here so

284
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,280
they're thinking about what to do and

285
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,190
someone said well you know here's a

286
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,680
crazy idea what so so the reason this

287
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,420
Lake exists you know this is all desert

288
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,190
by the way this is all desert but

289
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,530
there's a lake up here in the desert and

290
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,060
the reason that Lake is there is because

291
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,710
there's these little streams that come

292
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,790
out of the mountains out of the Sierras

293
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:41,720
and they drain down into Owens Lake so

294
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:44,310
what if we captured those streams and

295
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,030
instead of allowing the streams to fill

296
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,730
the lake we we laid this giant pipe all

297
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:52,530
the way from this lake all the way to

298
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,920
Los Angeles and we'll just take that

299
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:58,860
stream water and we'll redirect it to LA

300
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:03,030
okay sounds crazy but that's what they

301
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,320
did and so they decided this you know

302
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,000
this again this is a lady to her

303
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,610
hundreds early 1900s when they're

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,120
thinking about this they're gonna start

305
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,860
this giant project to take water that

306
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,020
should be going into Owens Lake and

307
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:21,089
bring it all the way across the desert

308
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,750
to Los Angeles so we don't have a lot of

309
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,910
pictures

310
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,100
Owens like from back then this is one of

311
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,570
them so here you can see we've got the

312
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,250
Sierras here in the background you see

313
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,050
this body of water here okay this is

314
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,370
about 1900 there's some mining town or

315
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,540
something here up and up in the

316
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:39,210
foreground here and they're going to

317
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,330
form what's called the LA aqueduct that

318
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,700
is this red line that runs from Owens

319
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,440
Lake all the way down to Los Angeles

320
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,560
so again if you're one of my students I

321
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,570
have put up a map with all the things

322
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,060
I'm showing you okay it's all on it's

323
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,490
all on learn so you can so you can go

324
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,860
and see this print them out whatever

325
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:03,180
whatever you want to do so the LA

326
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:08,070
aqueduct huge project they started this

327
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:11,100
thing in 1908 223 miles of pipe were

328
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:15,120
laid to take water from Owens Lake all

329
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,490
the way to LA they finish it in 1913

330
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,290
realize at the time what they're dealing

331
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,870
with in terms you know cars hadn't

332
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,880
really been invented I mean a little bit

333
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,310
but not so much pretty much everything

334
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,960
is doing is with you know mule teams

335
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,830
there's no electricity there's no

336
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:35,150
tractors and they're doing this big

337
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:38,610
project right so it was a pretty

338
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,350
significant thing to build so here is

339
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,450
another old picture again there's Owens

340
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,520
Lake in the background and here's this

341
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,430
concrete conduit that's the LA aqueduct

342
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,620
so what's gonna flow in the bottom of

343
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,660
this ditch and in here it kind of looks

344
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,420
like the oils that we have around here

345
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,250
in Albuquerque is water that's supposed

346
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,300
to be flowing into the lake but instead

347
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:03,180
is headed south then from this concrete

348
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,760
ditch this is what it looks like today

349
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:09,150
okay so that's water that's on its way

350
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,540
to LA it will go into these pipes so

351
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,730
these are the pieces that were these big

352
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,750
pieces they were brought made in Germany

353
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,610
and brought in the you can still see see

354
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,260
them today there they are going across

355
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:28,260
the desert floor they go up mountains

356
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:32,010
oops they go down mountains they go

357
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:35,520
across the desert through towns across

358
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,400
freeways and then eventually that water

359
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,140
comes down into the LA basin so this

360
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,890
thing right here it's like a bunch of

361
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,710
little stairs

362
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:47,790
that's water coming down into Los

363
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:50,370
Angeles so the guy that I was in charge

364
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:53,220
of this is William Mulholland and

365
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,410
Mulholland is this kind of famous name

366
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,140
in LA there's Mulholland Drive and

367
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:03,240
you'll hear songs and movies referencing

368
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:06,540
Mulholland so that guy was he was in

369
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,120
charge of this project and in the 1980s

370
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,840
there was a pretty famous book written

371
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,030
called Cadillac desert and it goes into

372
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,020
detail about this and some of the other

373
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:22,170
water projects were talking about and

374
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:24,540
PBS in the mid 90s put out this big

375
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,700
mini-series on Cadillac desert and I

376
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,650
think it was like like nine hours long

377
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,630
something like that and for whatever

378
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,150
reason they never released it as an

379
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:35,460
actual video that you can watch today so

380
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,310
the only parts of it that exist are

381
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:42,090
parts that were recorded on VCRs back in

382
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:44,220
the 90s and uploaded to YouTube so the

383
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,440
quality is really really poor and I'm

384
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,020
just gonna show you a couple minutes of

385
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,570
a clip of them building the LA aqueduct

386
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,770
so again I apologize the quality is

387
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,200
pretty poor it's the only thing we

388
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,420
really have today so I'm going to show

389
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,660
that real quick here

390
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:04,629
[Music]

391
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,490
it was a great drama it was a great epic

392
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:11,039
drama of the building of that aqueduct

393
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:15,309
do you have mule teams and you have men

394
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:19,659
they were working in desert heat arid

395
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:21,699
conditions water was a problem

396
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:24,189
ironically enough here in this giant

397
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,709
water project they had they had to worry

398
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:30,000
about adequate water for the working

399
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,000
stock and the men

400
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,710
it can be almost freezing it at night

401
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:42,960
and then 110 degrees in the daytime

402
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:45,910
practically maja was there all the time

403
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,790
chief engineer Mulholland had no formal

404
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,860
training in civil engineering he had in

405
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,560
fact never graduated from grade school

406
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,140
the automobile had barely been invented

407
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,570
clipper ships were still sailing the

408
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,580
seas and this was an engineering project

409
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,210
the likes of which the world had really

410
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,210
never seen before

411
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,370
Mulholland ordered two 12-foot steel

412
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,920
pipe forged in Germany and shipped

413
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,620
around the horn a hundred thousand men

414
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,570
and women worked on the aqueducts but

415
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,760
never more than a few thousand at a time

416
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:24,100
because the exhausting and dangerous

417
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:27,160
work kept turnover so high they had been

418
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,610
farmhands cowboys and hard rock miners

419
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,790
but now they were city employees civil

420
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,610
servants like the chief himself with no

421
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:39,340
air-conditioning no refrigeration no

422
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,530
hard hats in 110 degree heat

423
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,450
they crossed the Mojave in five years

424
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,900
with a pipe big enough to hold a

425
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,900
locomotive

426
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,870
this was you know an aqueduct that would

427
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:54,779
have reached all the way across

428
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:59,419
Massachusetts and then almost all the

429
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:02,130
way back through a desert with mountains

430
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:06,299
what they were really building was was

431
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:08,159
the world's largest garden hose surveyor

432
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,590
said they could build the aqueduct

433
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,779
simply by following the trail of whiskey

434
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:17,149
bottles Mulholland and Eaton had thrown

435
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:17,149
off the back of their buckboard in 1904

436
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,070
in the end the chief and his lieutenants

437
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,430
finished the job under budget and ahead

438
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,430
of schedule

439
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,889
William Mulholland built his original

440
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:35,139
aqueduct so well that to this day it

441
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:37,859
still carries the Owens River to the

442
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,859
people of Los Angeles

443
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:46,440
the phrase Grandpa's aqueduct will

444
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,440
remind my first words

445
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:53,730
the day of the dedication of the

446
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,860
aqueduct was without a doubt the high

447
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:03,600
point of my grandfather's life

448
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:05,610
a crowd of 30 to 40,000 Los Angelenos

449
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,030
had gathered at the base of the spillway

450
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:11,160
there was a formal program but once the

451
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,080
water spilled down the Cascade the

452
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,120
formal program was abandoned because

453
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,690
thousands of people rushed with their

454
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,420
tin cups to drink the water

455
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,420
[Music]

456
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,780
when the water came cascading down there

457
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,290
Mahal and who was really exhausted at

458
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:31,570
the time gave what I think is the most

459
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:34,420
concise dedication speech in history he

460
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:40,500
unfurled an American flag he turned to

461
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:40,500
the water and he said there it is taken

462
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,870
[Applause]

463
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,059
based on Mulholland predictions it was

464
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:58,390
four times more water than Los Angeles

465
00:20:52,059 --> 00:21:00,669
could use so you probably figured out

466
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,410
that was mo Holland's granddaughter in

467
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,730
that in that movie

468
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,600
the other thing they wanted you to pay

469
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,850
attention to is in the opening ceremony

470
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,400
yeah the release the water comes down

471
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,530
the spillway and all that and Mulholland

472
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,929
says this is four times the amount of

473
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,600
water that Los Angeles is ever going to

474
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:22,270
need so keep that in mind okay

475
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,830
so they take the waters that are

476
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,470
supposed to be going into Owens Lake

477
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:29,590
they redirect them to LA what happens to

478
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,980
the lake dries up okay so if you're one

479
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,780
of my students and you're trying to find

480
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,179
Owens Lake on the map you may have had

481
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,350
some trouble because the lake no longer

482
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:44,590
exists here we can see where it was this

483
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,710
big brown spot used to be full of water

484
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:50,590
okay and notice what's around right this

485
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:54,640
is pretty dry sagebrush we're in a

486
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,540
pretty dry area and you can see from

487
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,450
space

488
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,429
where the lake used to be so this again

489
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,030
kind of light-colored spot right there

490
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:06,669
and this lake was pretty important to

491
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,490
the environment because when you have a

492
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:11,590
lake sitting out here in the desert it's

493
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,830
super important for all kinds of

494
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,630
organisms to survive out there and that

495
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,870
includes those that live around the lake

496
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:22,630
plus a lot of the migratory animals that

497
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,390
stopped there to refuel and

498
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,280
what-have-you before they move on so you

499
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,800
know a lot of migratory birds for

500
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,260
example used to stop at Owens Lake on

501
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,000
their way one way or the other and now

502
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,600
they can't do that because that Lake is

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,630
no longer

504
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,429
there so this is you know there was a

505
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,070
complete collapse of the ecosystem

506
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:45,280
around from the disappearance of Lake

507
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,809
Owens and you'll notice here that this

508
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,500
so this is what it looks like today

509
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:52,720
these are all mostly kind of salts that

510
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,669
were left behind after the lake dried up

511
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,160
see this kind of white if you walk on

512
00:22:54,669 --> 00:23:00,100
this is kind of white crunchy texture to

513
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,799
it and when the wind blows it blows up

514
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,590
dust from this lake bed now if you

515
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,260
remember a few lectures ago on air

516
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:13,480
pollution we said that particulate

517
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:16,299
matter PM is one of the regulated

518
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,520
pollutants that we keep track of in this

519
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:21,280
country from the Clean Air Act so in the

520
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,669
80s the EPA goes to the city of Los

521
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,010
Angeles and says see all this PM that's

522
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:29,230
your guys's fault okay cuz you caused

523
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,429
this lake to dry up and now the winds

524
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,390
blow and that dust and you're

525
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:37,059
responsible so la says okay here's what

526
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,130
we're going to do we will drill a well

527
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,080
and we're going to install sprinklers on

528
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,140
the bottom oh it used to be the lake bed

529
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,870
so they're irrigating the bottom of the

530
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,840
dried-up lake bed to prevent the dust

531
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:52,990
from blowing all this PM up into the air

532
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,030
okay that's their solution there's been

533
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,890
a few attempts to try to reintroduce a

534
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,330
little bit of water into the lake to try

535
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,909
to get some of the wildlife to come back

536
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,919
you can see this little sector here has

537
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:04,210
a little bit of water in it when I say a

538
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:06,370
little bit it's literally just a few

539
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,309
inches of deep right so all the white

540
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:13,030
area that's that's the salty spots again

541
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:15,669
so a little bit but not enough to really

542
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:20,650
bring it back to anywhere where in the

543
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:23,530
status it used to be well that works for

544
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,850
a while and we get to 1930 and the

545
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:31,299
population of LA has increased tenfold

546
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:34,000
again to over a million people and oh

547
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:36,429
look we're out of water so no it wasn't

548
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,640
four times the amount of water that la

549
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:42,039
would need thirty years or so later

550
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,090
they're already out of water so what are

551
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:48,670
they gonna do so they look around on the

552
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:54,220
map and I said well

553
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:57,670
here's a crazy idea way up north there's

554
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,640
another Lake Cod Mono Lake how about we

555
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:03,010
do this same game plan and we extend our

556
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,320
aqueduct up here and take the water

557
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:09,730
that's supposed to be going into Mono

558
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,740
Lake so this is the plan and what they

559
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,930
do is they extend that aqueduct that

560
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,990
went up to Owens Lake and they continue

561
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:19,720
on this red line here in a 1941 they get

562
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,790
all the way to Mono Lake and they start

563
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,960
taking the waters that are supposed to

564
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:28,180
be going into Mono Lake well this is

565
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,490
what Mono Lake looks like today now it

566
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,530
has not dried up yet and we'll talk

567
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,540
about why in a second but you can see

568
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,370
the lake used to be a lot bigger you can

569
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,470
see where the old shorelines used to be

570
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,940
out here

571
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,630
these are islands that used to be

572
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,090
underwater

573
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:47,490
okay so it used to me about twice as big

574
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:51,940
as it is today well it was drying up and

575
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:56,080
in fact by the time you get to about

576
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:59,200
1960 or so the volume of the lake had

577
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,330
halved and the salinity had doubled so

578
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,970
you see in this body of water it's twice

579
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,370
as salty as it was before and animals

580
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,950
are having trouble surviving things are

581
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,860
starting to die out and it looks like to

582
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,140
everybody that the whole ecosystem is

583
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:17,980
collapsing just like Owens Lake did

584
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:21,070
right so a bunch of citizens got

585
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,410
together and they cited before this lake

586
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,990
completely dries up like Owens Lake

587
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:28,450
we're gonna fight this in court and they

588
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,950
got together and they sued city of Los

589
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:33,820
Angeles and there was in the 1970s

590
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:37,090
there's something called the Mono Lake

591
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,490
committee citizens and some scientists

592
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:43,300
got together and started these lawsuits

593
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:46,390
to try to slow the destruction of Mono

594
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:52,210
Lake and it goes to court and after

595
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:54,670
several years they decided that they

596
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:58,830
said okay he the court decision

597
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:01,690
essentially was if I go back here

598
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,610
la is allowed to take water

599
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,710
but they cannot allow the lake to go

600
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,039
below a certain level which is the level

601
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:11,649
you see here in this picture so it's not

602
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,299
going to get any deeper it's not gonna

603
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:15,850
get any fuller but it's also not

604
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,470
supposed to go down anymore okay so

605
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,809
that's the ruling that came out and

606
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:23,230
again this was 70s and 80s when this

607
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:24,909
happens and so that you know that was a

608
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,539
result of citizens just getting together

609
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:30,789
and suing and trying to prevent this

610
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:35,549
whole ecosystem from collapsing in the

611
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:39,039
same way that Owens Lake did okay well

612
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:41,769
by time he gets in 1960 the population

613
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:45,120
has now doubled since 1930 when they

614
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:48,220
started to go to Mono Lake and again

615
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,889
they're out of water right so another

616
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,549
solution they come up with is to double

617
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:56,470
up the aqueduct and so there's a second

618
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:59,590
LA aqueduct that goes parallel to the

619
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:02,230
first one so on this picture this is the

620
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,120
first one that pipe right there that's

621
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,710
the second one okay over here there's

622
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,480
the first one there is a second one so

623
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,700
they just have two pipes right next to

624
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,440
each other going right up to Lake Owens

625
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,250
so that they can take twice as much

626
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,289
water so from LA up to Owens Lake

627
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,149
there's actually two pipes next to each

628
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:23,250
other and then there's only one that

629
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:28,690
goes the rest of the way to Mono Lake

630
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:31,840
okay well Ellie's out of water still

631
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,759
after going to Owens Lake after going to

632
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,370
Mono Lake after doubling up the

633
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,460
aqueducts after getting the water out of

634
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:41,169
the rivers after getting the well water

635
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,360
so they start looking around right well

636
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:46,600
you know what there's a nice little

637
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,419
river over here called the Colorado sure

638
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,789
would be nice would take if we could

639
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:53,970
take some water out of that so this

640
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:57,879
brings up an important point which is

641
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:59,860
who legally is able to take water out of

642
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:02,950
a river if the river is shared between

643
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:06,250
several states so this is the Colorado

644
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:09,750
River starts in Colorado up up up here

645
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:12,970
off the map actually comes down through

646
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,580
from Colorado through Utah through

647
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,999
Arizona it's on the border

648
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,230
between Arizona and Nevada it's also on

649
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:22,899
the border between Arizona and

650
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:27,220
California it goes to Mexico goes out

651
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:30,759
into the Gulf of California so here's

652
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:32,110
the problem let's say Arizona says ok so

653
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,419
in case you didn't know this is the

654
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,070
Grand Canyon right here right so what's

655
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:38,529
preventing Arizona from saying we're

656
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,330
gonna put in a giant dam right here or

657
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,830
we're gonna block the water we're gonna

658
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:44,080
make this giant we're gonna fill the

659
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,519
whole Grand Canyon full of water and

660
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,769
we're just going to keep it and nobody

661
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:51,340
downstream is going to get any of it so

662
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:53,139
none of it goes to California so what's

663
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,799
preventing Arizona from doing that

664
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:59,379
because technically any state on the

665
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,919
river here could put up some kind of dam

666
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:06,609
and everybody downstream would would

667
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,960
suffer right so States realized they got

668
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:09,100
to figure something now this is about a

669
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,109
hundred years ago and they're thinking

670
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,940
about this so what they decide is that

671
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:18,879
if you are part of what's called the

672
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,730
Colorado River watershed you are

673
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:24,809
entitled to a portion of the Colorado

674
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:29,049
River water now what is a watershed so

675
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:30,940
all of these little red lines are Little

676
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:34,629
rivers and little creeks that ultimately

677
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,580
go into the Colorado River right so if

678
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:38,799
you are raindrop and you fall and you

679
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,960
land in this red zone anywhere here

680
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:45,100
you'll end up in the Colorado River

681
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,739
that's the watershed ok this whole area

682
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:51,009
are all these rivers that ultimately

683
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:54,940
feed the Colorado River we're gonna zoom

684
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:59,049
in a little bit here so the Colorado

685
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:01,239
River itself doesn't even go through New

686
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:02,830
Mexico for example right it's over here

687
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:06,039
ok and it goes this way

688
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:07,450
but here we are here's New Mexico and

689
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:10,239
notice that we have some of those little

690
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:13,690
red lines over here so we have a bunch

691
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:15,669
of little creeks that ultimately flow to

692
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,999
the west and end up in the Colorado

693
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:21,940
River so what this means is states like

694
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:26,139
ours we don't have the Colorado River

695
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,879
but because our little streams feed the

696
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:30,249
Colorado River we

697
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:33,309
are legally entitled to a portion of the

698
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:36,279
Colorado River water as are all the

699
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:41,379
states that have a little bit of these

700
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:43,899
red lines okay including California now

701
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:45,789
California has a pretty tiny measly

702
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:48,069
amount of watershed right it's just like

703
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:49,989
a couple little chunks of red line here

704
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:51,999
that's the only thing that feeds the

705
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:54,219
Colorado River and they're in the desert

706
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:57,129
anyway so that's not a lot of water but

707
00:31:54,219 --> 00:32:01,119
technically they're allowed to have some

708
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:02,559
of the Colorado River water well they

709
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,119
decided that what they're going to do is

710
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,799
they're going to split up all of these

711
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:07,749
states into what we call upper basin

712
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,129
States and lower Basin States so these

713
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:11,739
are all states that are part of that

714
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:15,489
watershed they all legally get some

715
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:17,019
water okay but they're gonna subdivide

716
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:19,989
and again here's that little bit though

717
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:23,019
of California here but they're gonna sub

718
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:25,539
you're gonna subdivide the Colorado

719
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:27,249
River water up between all of the states

720
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:30,459
that have part of this either upper

721
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:34,569
basin or lower basin shading okay so all

722
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:36,639
these states get something so in 1922 a

723
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:38,099
bunch of politicians get together to

724
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:42,639
hash out what's called the Colorado

725
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:45,759
River Compact the Colorado River Compact

726
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,649
is like a treaty among instead of treaty

727
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,579
among nations as a treaty among states

728
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:55,539
and they decide okay we're gonna figure

729
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:59,619
out who gets what now is it evenly

730
00:32:55,539 --> 00:33:03,399
divided based on the watershed know who

731
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:06,489
gets the most amount of water California

732
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:09,249
gets the biggest amount of water even

733
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:11,559
though they have a very tiny portion of

734
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:13,959
the watershed but they had the biggest

735
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:17,079
population so they had most political

736
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:21,459
weight when this is all decided there's

737
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:25,089
a unit here capital am capital a FY that

738
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:28,959
stands for million acre feet per year

739
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:31,269
what does that mean an acre imagine a

740
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:32,769
football field okay now imagine a

741
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,109
football field that you flood with

742
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,789
twelve inches of water a foot so now

743
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:39,069
you've got a flooded football field with

744
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:42,370
a foot of water on it that's called an

745
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:44,770
acre foot of water now imagine

746
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:48,340
you can't really but a million of those

747
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,110
that's a million acre-feet okay so what

748
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,760
this is saying is that Colorado you get

749
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:54,940
three point eight eight six million

750
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,390
acre-feet per year and Nevada you get

751
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:02,580
point three million acre-feet per year

752
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:04,600
so this is all hashed out in 1922 now

753
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,100
how did they come up with these numbers

754
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,440
well what they did is they went and they

755
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,320
surveyed the Colorado River and they

756
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,590
wanted to figure out how much water does

757
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,659
the Colorado River deliver okay so in

758
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,280
1922 they go out with a bunch of gauges

759
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,350
and they're measuring how much flow was

760
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,300
coming down the Colorado and then they

761
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,750
look at that number and they divide it

762
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:29,169
up between all these states well we now

763
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,960
know there was a problem with that 1922

764
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:35,220
was an unusually wet year and we've had

765
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,770
very few years since then as wet as 1922

766
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:41,620
so all of these numbers are based on an

767
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:46,510
unusually wet year which means that

768
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:50,830
today on a normal drier year that these

769
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:54,460
numbers cannot be obtained but there's a

770
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:57,070
treaty in 1922 that says each state gets

771
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,230
to have this much water so right away

772
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,820
out of the gate we get a problem because

773
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,440
the states are now fighting each other

774
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,860
that they're not getting their fair

775
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,080
share of water we are we've been in the

776
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:11,080
drought we'll talk about this later for

777
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:13,680
many years in the southwest which means

778
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,820
that these numbers are much lower than

779
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,400
you know much much lower than they were

780
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,680
in 1922 so this is a cause for friction

781
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,450
in in the southwest because everybody

782
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,860
wants to the water they're legally

783
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:28,060
entitled to it but there's just not

784
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:32,200
enough to go around okay

785
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:33,910
so once that's hashed out in 1922 and it

786
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,830
races okay you get this much do you get

787
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,490
this much do you get this much now

788
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:41,080
people can start building dams and

789
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,910
taking water out of the Colorado River

790
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,760
okay so again if you're one of my

791
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:48,700
students we on your map I had you find

792
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,520
some of these dams and sand outline some

793
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,160
of these reservoirs and again I have put

794
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,780
a map on learn with what these features

795
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,180
on there

796
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,330
one of the very first dams major dams

797
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:04,030
that's get gets built is Hoover Dam okay

798
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:08,260
which is now next to modern-day Las

799
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:10,210
Vegas this is what Hoover Dam looks like

800
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,640
before they built it as the site of

801
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:15,160
Hoover Dam you see how these rock

802
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,470
there's that there's a narrow kind of a

803
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,090
v-shape here whenever they're trying to

804
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,360
build a dam they're looking for a spot

805
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,880
where the River narrows because it makes

806
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,400
it easier to build across this so

807
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,890
they're gonna fill up this V in this

808
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,290
Canyon with concrete and that's gonna be

809
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,270
Hoover Dam so here they are building it

810
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,770
this is in the 30s kind of a

811
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,350
depression-era project puts a lot of

812
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,750
people to work and here's what it looks

813
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,670
like when it's done so this is the

814
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,450
Colorado River now it's stuck behind

815
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:49,330
this wall that's over dam and notice

816
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,680
these towers here okay and I'm going to

817
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,590
show you another picture of referencing

818
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,620
these towers in a second so they build

819
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:58,420
this dam 1935 and the Colorado River

820
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,580
comes up behind it and gets stuck and

821
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,920
starts to fill up with water and that's

822
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,870
going to become Lake Mead so here we are

823
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,600
filling up the dam here's those four

824
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:09,160
towers again and here's what it looks

825
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,890
like when it's full there's the four

826
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,340
towers all the ones off the picture this

827
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:18,280
is one of the few times that Lake Mead

828
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:22,180
was full in fact it's flowing over this

829
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,730
this overspill area right here this is

830
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,700
in the 1980s and then usually what time

831
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:29,410
turns out it's almost never ever ever

832
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,300
looks like this okay this is what it

833
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:35,650
looks like when like me and is actually

834
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:38,230
full so the lake you realize was formed

835
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:40,780
by just flooding the river that was

836
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,970
behind the dam right so we the river was

837
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,160
coming along and doing its own thing we

838
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,260
fill this up with concrete and now the

839
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,450
water starts to build up behind it so

840
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,820
this is gonna make a lake but it's a

841
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:54,280
weird Lake like normally if you if you

842
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,230
explain if you tell somebody I'm going

843
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,730
to go up to a lake they're kind of

844
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,160
visualizing usually something kind of

845
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:03,160
roundish but we're making artificial

846
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,310
lakes here by putting a dam up and and

847
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,520
so we're flooding a what used to be a

848
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:14,530
river and it just floods it up straight

849
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:18,400
and makes a makes a very unusual shaped

850
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:22,060
lake and here you can see those how dry

851
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,010
this is okay what if you haven't been to

852
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:27,010
Las Vegas you know what's it like

853
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,930
this is temperatures routinely over 100

854
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,020
degrees in the summer the relative

855
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:35,950
humidity is a few percent routinely

856
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:38,230
here's like Mead winding out into the

857
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,910
distance rakes this is just this was a

858
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:43,360
river valley but now it's full of water

859
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,380
look how dry it is right nothing nothing

860
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,900
growing here at all

861
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,840
what's the evaporation rate do you think

862
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:52,240
you got temperatures over a hundred

863
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,480
degrees routinely relative humidity

864
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,810
single percent big surface area right

865
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:03,400
big surface area you're losing a lot of

866
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:05,590
water to to evaporation and so you're in

867
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,470
this area that's super dry you're

868
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,560
building dams to store water because you

869
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,210
want water to live where it's super dry

870
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,270
but you're also losing a lot of it

871
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:20,740
through evaporation

872
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:22,210
well once Lake Mead is built or if sorry

873
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,950
once Hoover Dam is built and the Lake

874
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:31,210
Mead is their loss and Las Vegas was

875
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:33,040
this little tiny nothing in 1930 this is

876
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,920
the whole city but now you've got a

877
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,520
source of water the dam is producing

878
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,830
electricity so yeah source electricity

879
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,840
prohibition ends and also we had a

880
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:47,410
moratorium on gambling most people don't

881
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,990
know this but back prohibition days you

882
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,380
couldn't gamble either and so all those

883
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,990
things

884
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,190
prohibition ends gambling is legal you

885
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,560
got a source of water you got

886
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,010
electricity Las Vegas just explodes

887
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,180
right

888
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:04,210
and so water use in Las Vegas explodes

889
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:07,300
along with it so here's a population and

890
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,730
this is in thousands so so a thousand

891
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,730
thousand is a million right so the

892
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:16,000
population is going up that's these dots

893
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:18,790
right and then as it goes up the water

894
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,610
consumption goes up to in millions of

895
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:23,680
gallons per day now this is coming out

896
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:26,529
of the groundwater there

897
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,299
so they're using groundwater whether

898
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:30,069
they can they're using water out of Lake

899
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:33,849
Mead because it's there and they're

900
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:37,150
legally entitled to some of it but of

901
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:39,489
course the water is very much needed for

902
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,049
very important things like the Bellagio

903
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:42,460
fountains right you've got to have that

904
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:44,650
do you think there's any evaporation

905
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,529
going on here you're throwing little

906
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,900
droplets of water up into a hundred plus

907
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:52,390
degree air with relative humidities and

908
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,430
single digits how much water do you

909
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,489
suppose they're losing here just an

910
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,109
evaporation or maybe you need to use

911
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:01,569
that water for other very important

912
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:03,430
things like golf courses and I

913
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:06,249
especially like this picture to show the

914
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:08,769
stark contrast between the super dry

915
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:12,700
desert here in the background and the

916
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:14,499
heavily irrigated Golf Course right next

917
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,900
to it so that's where a lot of this

918
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:17,609
water ends up going out of the Colorado

919
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,430
River

920
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:23,859
so that is Hoover Dam and Lake Mead

921
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,329
right we go upstream we go through the

922
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,099
Grand Canyon go through the Grand Canyon

923
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:29,440
go through the Grand Canyon and we get

924
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:31,690
up here and there's another dam called

925
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,380
the Glen Canyon Dam and behind the Glen

926
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:37,210
Canyon Dam is Lake Powell so same idea

927
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,730
the Colorado River was coming through

928
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:43,539
here minding its own business we put up

929
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:46,059
this big dam we block it the river

930
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:48,730
canyon floods and so now we have this

931
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:51,849
big funny windy looking lake called Lake

932
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:53,920
Powell which is just a flooded river

933
00:41:51,849 --> 00:42:00,309
canyon so it's this weird windy looking

934
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:02,589
thing well glen canyon dam was built at

935
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:05,549
a time when this was in the 50s and

936
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:08,230
there's actually a significant amount of

937
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:12,130
protests around building this dam and

938
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:16,210
the reason for that is because glen

939
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:18,249
canyon itself was a canyon that people

940
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,579
actually like to visit it was kind of an

941
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:23,769
extension of the Grand Canyon so the

942
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:26,079
picture on the right is what it looked

943
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:28,450
like before they flooded it so all this

944
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,849
water is flooding this Canyon right

945
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:32,710
there's water up to the top of this

946
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:34,660
canyon at least there is in this picture

947
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,789
this is what it looked like this is what

948
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,060
they flooded and there's a significant

949
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:39,340
number

950
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,050
people who thought this is a really bad

951
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,060
idea because this is a really beautiful

952
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:45,250
place it's one of the nicest places in

953
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,920
the world to go you can go rafting you

954
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,320
go fishing you can go camping and we

955
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,610
don't want to lose this we don't want to

956
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,890
flood it like this doesn't make any

957
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,930
sense and people fought this and so

958
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,060
these pictures I'm showing you are what

959
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:00,480
it looked like before the dam was built

960
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,670
so these are all pictures from the 1950s

961
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,410
or before so you can see it's a pretty

962
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,160
nice place right I mean it carrying

963
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:11,130
mines you of the Grand Canyon it's it's

964
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,110
similar to to the Grand Canyon except

965
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:17,220
it's now all underwater people used to

966
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:20,860
go rafting slot canyons the whole thing

967
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:22,930
here they are starting to build the dam

968
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,790
the dam is going to go right here okay

969
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:27,730
so that Canyon behind us that's going to

970
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,710
be filled with water now an interesting

971
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,750
point to this story is that because

972
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:35,680
we've had a lot of drought in the last

973
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:38,650
20 years in the southwest that Lake

974
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,870
Powell is no longer up to the top like I

975
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,300
showed you in those earlier pictures and

976
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:47,430
as the lake has been receding it's

977
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:49,900
revealing some of the original Canyon

978
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,140
not like it used to be but you you're

979
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,780
starting to actually see a canyon again

980
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,790
so that's an example where some you know

981
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:02,050
groups got together they fought the

982
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:04,240
formation of a dam didn't work out it's

983
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,400
dam was still built there are still

984
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,040
groups today fighting to get the dam

985
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,540
removed okay so this is I mean I don't

986
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,610
think they have a very good chance of

987
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,310
this but there's still people are still

988
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,590
trying to get that damn removed worth

989
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:20,380
pointing out that there was also another

990
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:24,180
dam that was going to go up somewhere

991
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:26,740
around in here kind of in the middle of

992
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:30,340
between Hoover Dam and Glen Canyon Dam

993
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:33,040
and that one was also fought and that

994
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,110
one was dropped so we could have had

995
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,440
another dam that would have floated a

996
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:41,950
good portion of the Grand Canyon and our

997
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,690
predecessors thankfully I think fought

998
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:45,570
that and per invented that so we

999
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,570
actually have the Grand Canyon as it is

1000
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,570
today

1001
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:52,670
so we're going to talk a little bit

1002
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,450
about some of the problems of putting

1003
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:59,239
dams on a river like the Colorado and

1004
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:01,339
let's just imagine that we had you know

1005
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:04,309
think about a river going down a slope

1006
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:07,009
and the water is coming down doing what

1007
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:13,339
rivers do and then what I'm gonna do is

1008
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:17,839
put up this dam and the water is going

1009
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:21,049
to accumulate behind the dam fill up and

1010
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:23,150
produce a reservoir right and then I'm

1011
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:26,569
gonna have some way of releasing a

1012
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,029
little bit of water out the bottom that

1013
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:30,259
continues on down the stream right so

1014
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:33,499
that's the system that we have in place

1015
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:36,410
so what's the problem with that so one

1016
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:40,009
of the biggest problems is if you are an

1017
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:44,989
organism like a fish and you are trying

1018
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:46,609
to say get from here to here you've got

1019
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:50,390
a problem because you've got this big

1020
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:53,719
dam structure in the way okay and some

1021
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:57,829
fish really need to migrate that's part

1022
00:45:53,719 --> 00:46:01,190
of their natural life cycle so salmon

1023
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:04,729
are a classic example so salmon start

1024
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:08,209
start their life out up in a very

1025
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:12,289
shallow slow-moving Creek and they lay

1026
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:18,380
eggs okay and then the parents die off

1027
00:46:12,289 --> 00:46:20,479
and the eggs hatch in the spring and you

1028
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:24,469
got a little baby salmon with you guys

1029
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:26,509
and they grow in this river again a very

1030
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:28,339
slow moving River usually for a couple

1031
00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:30,920
years and then when they get big enough

1032
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:31,670
they migrate downstream and they head

1033
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,650
towards the ocean

1034
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:38,180
so they come out into the ocean and

1035
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:41,529
they'll spend years out in the ocean

1036
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:46,880
swimming around doing whatever salmon do

1037
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:49,579
late in life they come back to the same

1038
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,380
river that they came out of and we don't

1039
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:52,759
know how they do this they must they

1040
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,609
must every River must have a unique

1041
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:58,999
chemical signature that they can detect

1042
00:46:55,609 --> 00:47:01,819
somehow but they'll go back and find the

1043
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:02,570
same river they came from and they'll go

1044
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,840
upstream

1045
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:07,970
so they gotta go up the river now and so

1046
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:11,690
whenever you see pictures of salmon

1047
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:13,520
jumping trying to get up little rapids

1048
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:16,040
or waterfalls they're trying to get back

1049
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,420
to the place where they were born now go

1050
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,900
all the way back to the place where they

1051
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:23,420
were born they find a mate they lay eggs

1052
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,410
and then they die and the whole process

1053
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,350
starts again

1054
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:30,050
right so this is what salmon do so if

1055
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,400
you put up a dam in the middle of that

1056
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:33,440
whole process

1057
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,870
you've just prevented this whole

1058
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,630
lifecycle from taking place

1059
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:40,390
right which is a major bummer if you're

1060
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:43,430
a salmon trying to make a living now

1061
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:46,250
there's a few things that have been done

1062
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:49,610
to try to mitigate this namely something

1063
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:53,420
called fish ladders so the dam is over

1064
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:55,220
here okay and so just to orient you so

1065
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:58,100
there's a there's a stream that would be

1066
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,870
kind of behind us so before the dam was

1067
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,570
in place the salmon would come this way

1068
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:04,850
and then they just go upstream to where

1069
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:06,680
you know this concrete would not have

1070
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,780
been there originally and they just go

1071
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,000
up to where they need to go but now this

1072
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,310
concrete's here so what they have is you

1073
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,850
can see these little look like little

1074
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,000
steps

1075
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,830
that's a fish ladder and so the salmon

1076
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,660
figure out that there's water coming

1077
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:23,030
down this way so they instinctively go

1078
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,880
up and they go up all the way these

1079
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:28,250
through these steps up up up up up up up

1080
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,930
and then they jump off and they land on

1081
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,480
the other side of the dam that's a fish

1082
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,890
ladder and there are places where you

1083
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,140
can actually kind of watch this in

1084
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:39,350
action so here's a salmon trying to jump

1085
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,420
the stairs of a fish ladder and there's

1086
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:43,420
you see a bunch of them trying to get up

1087
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,770
the fish ladder so it kind of works

1088
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,410
definitely some salmon are able to

1089
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:53,240
return home through fish ladders and

1090
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:56,390
keep going but a big problem you have is

1091
00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:00,230
with oxygenation so back in my picture

1092
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:02,990
of this dam here if this fills with

1093
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:05,990
water the water down here is very

1094
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:10,600
stagnant okay and because it's very

1095
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,600
stagnant has very little oxygen

1096
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:21,100
and dams are designed to release water

1097
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:24,790
out at the bottom so the water that

1098
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:29,080
comes out of the bottom of this dam also

1099
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:30,760
has little oxygen now that's not true

1100
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,770
with the water that goes into the dam

1101
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,110
right you've got Rapids

1102
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,790
you've got fast-moving water gurgling

1103
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:40,230
bubbling there's a lot of oxygen in

1104
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:43,840
there it fills up this reservoir and

1105
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:47,530
stagnates and that little oxygen water

1106
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:50,290
comes out goes down stream so any

1107
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:53,110
animals that are down here are stuck in

1108
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:56,880
this water that has relatively little

1109
00:49:53,110 --> 00:50:01,210
oxygen a lot of them don't like that

1110
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:04,030
sometimes your deoxygenation can get to

1111
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:07,030
the point that fish actually die so this

1112
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:09,580
is here we're in the dam okay so now

1113
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,500
we're we're talking about fish living in

1114
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,390
this part in the reservoir and the

1115
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,670
oxygen level got so low that a whole

1116
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,650
bunch of fish died and usually happens

1117
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,910
overnight so during the day there's some

1118
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:21,100
photosynthesis that's helping

1119
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,600
reoxygenate the water but then

1120
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,700
respiration is happening all night long

1121
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,430
and that's when your oxygen level goes

1122
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:30,390
down so this can happen if you don't

1123
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:34,840
have enough oxygen in your reservoirs

1124
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:37,060
the deep water also is colder so this

1125
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:41,140
water that comes out down here not only

1126
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:43,420
is low oxygen but it's cold and again

1127
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:46,270
we're thinking about the animals that

1128
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,100
lived in the in the water before the dam

1129
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:50,470
was built they are used to pretty

1130
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:53,470
shallow pretty fast-moving water which

1131
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:55,450
is oxygenated and warmer than what's

1132
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:57,700
coming out of the dam right so what's

1133
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:00,160
coming out of the dam now is colder it

1134
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:02,710
has less oxygen and a lot of the animals

1135
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,750
just can't survive in that the other

1136
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:07,750
weird thing is that this water up here

1137
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:10,720
at the very top of the dam is actually

1138
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,490
warmer than it normally is it's stagnant

1139
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,370
there's isn't there's not a lot of

1140
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:17,530
mixing the Sun's up every day and it's

1141
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:21,730
warming the the top layer of that water

1142
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:25,990
and so for example you take something

1143
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:26,840
like this Glen Canyon Dam is we've seen

1144
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:29,900
this picture before

1145
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,610
Canyon Dam and Lake Powell and this used

1146
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:37,610
to be a fast-moving river which is now

1147
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:39,920
just pretty stagnant and you go from the

1148
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:42,410
water that was in the Glen Canyon Dam or

1149
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,600
I'm sorry in Glen Canyon before the dam

1150
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:48,080
and you can see it's kind of choppy and

1151
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:51,490
it's aerated and could cooler

1152
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,200
temperature compared to the surface of

1153
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:56,800
what's on lake powell today and see how

1154
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,480
all those green stuff that's algae

1155
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,220
analogy is happy in this environment

1156
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,200
where there's not a lot of motion and

1157
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,090
it's relatively warm because we're

1158
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,530
talking about water at the top of the

1159
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,990
lake now not the bottom the bottom is

1160
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,690
called but the top isn't is warm so this

1161
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:13,490
is what it looks like now this is what

1162
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:16,340
when we built that dam Glen Canyon Dam

1163
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:18,230
we transformed this kind of water to

1164
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,240
this kind of water and that's again

1165
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:24,980
because it's stagnant it has really warm

1166
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:27,620
along the surface they prevent sediment

1167
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:32,360
from moving downstream okay so if you've

1168
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:35,420
got sediment coming down normally coming

1169
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:38,780
down it's being washed down and it heads

1170
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:41,690
out to the ocean but what happens is it

1171
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:44,150
starts to pile up behind the dam okay

1172
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,940
now why would that be important if you

1173
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:48,650
look at the mouth of a normal River so

1174
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,560
here comes here comes the river dumping

1175
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:54,620
out into the ocean you can see all this

1176
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:57,050
mud and you can see in the water that it

1177
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,910
has this brown or color this is sediment

1178
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:01,420
and this sediment is actually really

1179
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:04,070
needed by a lot of the ecosystems

1180
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:08,050
downstream from where the dam is is

1181
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:10,790
built so here's a couple of examples so

1182
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:12,740
here's our dam and here's the sediments

1183
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:16,580
that are accumulated behind the dam and

1184
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:20,560
the water is coming out so at first the

1185
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:24,500
water is flowing where it used to okay

1186
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:28,970
but because we are keeping the sediment

1187
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:33,430
trap back here that River will start to

1188
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:36,320
cut down into the surrounding rock and

1189
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,630
there's no sediment to come back and

1190
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,640
rebuild anything so what happens is the

1191
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:43,789
river starts actually cutting down

1192
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,670
word into the landscape

1193
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:48,829
now when the river cuts down the other

1194
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:51,740
thing that happens is it the water table

1195
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:54,920
also goes down with it so let's say in

1196
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:57,740
this scenario we had a river that was

1197
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:00,380
kind of near the surface here but and we

1198
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:02,089
had some trees let's just draw here

1199
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,279
let's say we've got some trees growing

1200
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:04,970
kind of by the river and they have a

1201
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:06,440
root system

1202
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:12,589
okay the root system comes down like

1203
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:17,390
this okay now as the river cuts down

1204
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:20,119
right as the river cuts down into the

1205
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:26,150
surrounding country eventually the water

1206
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:29,329
table goes down with it and the roots

1207
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:32,299
which used to be able to get ground

1208
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:34,519
water from the surrounding river now are

1209
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:38,029
dry because the river has now cut down

1210
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:40,279
below where the root systems are okay so

1211
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:43,369
that so I'm exaggerating this to

1212
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:48,140
illustrate a point but if the sediment

1213
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:50,450
is blocked then the river cuts cuts down

1214
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:52,970
cuts down cuts down water table drops

1215
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,980
with it and eventually you can drop far

1216
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,549
enough down that some vegetation

1217
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:02,990
downstream will eventually die because

1218
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:05,569
it can get water so therefore if you

1219
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:08,420
block sediment then the river downstream

1220
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:10,940
well you wrote away case we just talked

1221
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:12,079
about that rivers downstream cut down

1222
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,359
deeper than they used to

1223
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,789
okay so we talked about that and the

1224
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:20,900
water table lowers downstream and

1225
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:23,119
vegetation can die okay so those things

1226
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:26,410
can happen by just blocking the

1227
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,519
sediments from going downstream now

1228
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:32,680
everything we've been talking about is

1229
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:35,240
how the natural animals and plant life

1230
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,099
don't like these changes they don't like

1231
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,380
though the water that might be cold or

1232
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:41,329
has less oxygen or whatever or there's

1233
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,910
something that will right if you set up

1234
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:45,289
an artificial lake essentially and you

1235
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:48,799
change the temperature and you change

1236
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:50,480
the oxygen and there's some other

1237
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,700
organism that's actually going to thrive

1238
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,289
in that and they're going to get into

1239
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,099
these lakes and they're going to do well

1240
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:56,749
and you're going to

1241
00:55:55,099 --> 00:56:00,529
an invasive species problem on your

1242
00:55:56,749 --> 00:56:02,089
hands so by building dams and building

1243
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:05,960
these artificial reservoirs

1244
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:07,880
we're setting up situations environments

1245
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:12,999
for innovate invasive species to come in

1246
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:15,650
and wreak havoc on the natural ecosystem

1247
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:18,079
if you are in my class you had to

1248
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:21,769
identify a few major dams on a few

1249
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:24,019
rivers but realize there's a lot more

1250
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:26,479
than what the ones that we're talking

1251
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:29,150
about here so on the map that we're

1252
00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:32,359
using in my class which again is on

1253
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:36,380
learn or on my website here's a number

1254
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:39,140
of dams in various states which means

1255
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:41,839
that there's over 5,000 dams that are on

1256
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:43,940
that map I just had to identify a

1257
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:46,220
handful of them they're all different

1258
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:49,640
sizes right so they're not as always big

1259
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:51,289
as Hoover Dam some of them they're just

1260
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,210
a little structure just right underneath

1261
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:54,559
the water that you wouldn't even notice

1262
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,420
if you're standing there looking at it

1263
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:00,940
and some are these giant you know

1264
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:04,549
concrete structures so pretty much every

1265
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:07,339
water system River Creek whatever you

1266
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:09,019
want to call it is under control now

1267
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:11,809
that we have everything pretty much

1268
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:13,759
dammed up and we as humans control when

1269
00:57:11,809 --> 00:57:16,130
the rivers flow when they don't flow

1270
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:20,420
when they're allowed to flood etc

1271
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:22,849
there's very few waterways left in fact

1272
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:27,200
in the United States in general that are

1273
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:29,299
actually naturally flowing anymore so

1274
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,729
one thing that is on your map is

1275
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:33,859
something called the Continental Divide

1276
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:37,339
and the Continental Divide here is shown

1277
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:39,109
as the margin of this these two areas

1278
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:41,299
that lower Basin an upper basin

1279
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:43,009
what's the Continental Divide that's

1280
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:45,469
supposed to be the place in the country

1281
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:47,150
where if you're a raindrop and you fall

1282
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:49,819
on the east side of the Continental

1283
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:52,549
Divide you will eventually flow to the

1284
00:57:49,819 --> 00:57:53,749
east and into the Atlantic Ocean or

1285
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:56,239
maybe the Gulf of Mexico

1286
00:57:53,749 --> 00:57:58,460
if you range up and you fall on this

1287
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,900
side of the Continental Divide you flow

1288
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,489
to the west and you end up in the

1289
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,749
Pacific or you end up in the Gulf of

1290
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:07,640
California okay

1291
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:09,019
ask Continental Divide well Continental

1292
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,019
Divide is a natural

1293
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:15,679
boundary between where water drains

1294
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:18,319
right but there are several instances

1295
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,819
where humans would like to take water

1296
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:23,259
from one side of the Continental Divide

1297
00:58:19,819 --> 00:58:25,819
and bring it over to the other and

1298
00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:29,119
Colorado is one of those places so

1299
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:31,399
Colorado is entitled to a portion of the

1300
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,999
Colorado River water that's part of the

1301
00:58:31,399 --> 00:58:36,079
1922 agreement where are all the people

1302
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:39,499
in Colorado

1303
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:42,349
well Denver is over here and the rivers

1304
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:43,939
are over here now before Denver they

1305
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:45,919
still wanted water over here for

1306
00:58:43,939 --> 00:58:48,319
agricultural reasons right there's a lot

1307
00:58:45,919 --> 00:58:51,199
of reasons you might want to have water

1308
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:54,439
over here but it's draining the wrong

1309
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,649
way so what do you do you well what they

1310
00:58:54,439 --> 00:59:00,339
decided to do is they've decided to

1311
00:58:56,649 --> 00:59:02,539
drill tunnels through the mountains in

1312
00:59:00,339 --> 00:59:05,149
something called a trans mountain

1313
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:07,909
diversion trans mountain diversion means

1314
00:59:05,149 --> 00:59:09,130
the natural flow of the water is it's

1315
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:11,029
going to go on one side of the mountain

1316
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,259
but what we're going to do is we're

1317
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:14,209
going to put in some tunnels and we're

1318
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:17,749
going to redirect it through the other

1319
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:19,369
side okay so if you go in Colorado

1320
00:59:17,749 --> 00:59:22,759
you'll find some of these diversion

1321
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:24,739
tunnels in this water just literally

1322
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:26,869
going through a tunnel and through a

1323
00:59:24,739 --> 00:59:28,609
mountain coming out the other side this

1324
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:32,089
is water that's supposed to go in the

1325
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:34,669
Colorado River Colorado decided that

1326
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:37,699
what they wanted to do with their

1327
00:59:34,669 --> 00:59:40,130
Colorado River water is directed through

1328
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:42,259
under underground through the mountains

1329
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:46,279
and out the other side you know over

1330
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:48,979
towards in direction of Denver okay so

1331
00:59:46,279 --> 00:59:50,899
all of those things are happening along

1332
00:59:48,979 --> 00:59:53,269
the Colorado River we're building dams

1333
00:59:50,899 --> 00:59:54,549
we got trans mountain diversions let's

1334
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:57,049
go back to our friends in California

1335
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:58,969
remember they were running out of water

1336
00:59:57,049 --> 01:00:01,880
over and over and over and they were

1337
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:04,549
looking towards the Colorado and after

1338
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,169
1922 and that treaty has passed they're

1339
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:09,079
now allowed to take water from the

1340
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:10,929
Colorado and so there's a little dam

1341
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:13,909
that's on your map called Parker dam and

1342
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:16,819
it backs up the Colorado to this lake

1343
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:18,619
called Lake Havasu and if you go there

1344
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:20,929
this is what it looks like okay so

1345
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:22,219
there's a lake havasu in the back and

1346
01:00:20,929 --> 01:00:22,550
you notice there's water that kind of

1347
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,640
goes

1348
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:27,290
off to the left here that goes into a

1349
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:31,130
canal that's called the Colorado

1350
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:34,510
aqueduct and it takes water from the

1351
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:37,790
Colorado River across the desert and

1352
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:42,710
into Los Angeles this is what it looks

1353
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:44,840
like so it's a concrete lined ditch for

1354
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:50,600
the most part and the water goes across

1355
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:55,250
the desert and into modern-day Los

1356
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:58,160
Angeles as it makes its way there there

1357
01:00:55,250 --> 01:01:00,500
are opportunities for farmers to get

1358
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:03,560
water out of that and this is one of the

1359
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:05,510
early promotional traveling exhibits for

1360
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:09,500
the water that's coming to Los Angeles

1361
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:14,900
and this helped build up the

1362
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:17,690
agricultural areas around there well if

1363
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:20,840
there is a worse place to build a city

1364
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:24,170
than Las Vegas it might be Phoenix okay

1365
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,810
so it's just as hot as Las Vegas or

1366
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:30,080
hotter it's far away from any bodies of

1367
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:32,330
water out in the middle Arizona and so

1368
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:36,110
Phoenix is also having its own water

1369
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:38,470
difficulties and just like in California

1370
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,610
and all these places we're talking about

1371
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:43,610
they've been running out of ground water

1372
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:45,350
so this is not a great graphic this as

1373
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:50,030
approximate decline in groundwater

1374
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:56,030
levels from 1940 to 1995 so this is

1375
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:58,310
we're looking at feet so - 150 - 200 -

1376
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:01,250
50 that's how far the water groundwater

1377
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:03,230
level has dropped so what that means is

1378
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:06,850
if you lived saying in the bullseye you

1379
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:10,010
have to drill down 200 feet deeper in

1380
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:12,080
1995 to hit water than you did in 1940

1381
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:13,760
and what happens is as the groundwater

1382
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,530
goes down and down and down at some

1383
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,990
point it just becomes impractical to

1384
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:21,770
actually be able to drill a hole that

1385
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:24,590
deep and extract water the other problem

1386
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:26,600
that they're having in Phoenix is that

1387
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:29,000
they've been pumping so much groundwater

1388
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,820
out of the ground for so long that the

1389
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,540
ground is starting to sink and so here's

1390
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,620
a map of what we call a subsidence of of

1391
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:39,580
the ground

1392
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:42,710
so it says land surface displacement and

1393
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:45,950
the numbers are in centimeters so red

1394
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:48,320
means - 15 centimeters so this number

1395
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:51,140
here that's -12 that means the ground

1396
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:55,970
has literally sunk 12 centimeters

1397
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:59,560
between 1996 and the year 2000 right so

1398
01:02:55,970 --> 01:03:02,600
in 4 years this is how much recorded

1399
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:04,490
subsidence how much did the ground sink

1400
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:07,760
right and so you see this whole area

1401
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:10,430
here has been sinking and as a result of

1402
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,950
the area sinking there are these really

1403
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:15,410
strange fissures opening up around

1404
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:17,750
Phoenix because the ground is all

1405
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:20,090
sinking as they suck up all this ground

1406
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:25,040
water and these big fissures have been

1407
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:29,900
opening up all around so they need water

1408
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:33,260
right and they are entitled to Colorado

1409
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:35,360
River water so in fact if you go back to

1410
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:39,230
Parker dam which is when we just saw

1411
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:42,560
there is another project another canal

1412
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:45,380
that takes water from that dam from the

1413
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:48,260
Colorado River goes all across the

1414
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:52,100
Arizona desert and goes into Phoenix and

1415
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:54,860
then actually about last 10 years or so

1416
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:58,190
they've extended it all the way to get

1417
01:03:54,860 --> 01:04:00,980
into Tucson this is how Phoenix can

1418
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:03,670
continue to survive in one of the

1419
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:06,710
hottest driest places in the country

1420
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:08,690
called the central Arizona Project and

1421
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:10,880
here's what it looks like right just

1422
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:13,430
weird like this artificial river going

1423
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,600
through the desert and I like this

1424
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:19,490
picture because here we are in central

1425
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,690
Arizona and yet oh look we have golf

1426
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:23,930
courses how could that be

1427
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:25,820
you can see the the canal right next to

1428
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:30,550
it with all the water coming from the

1429
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:34,640
Colorado River another picture here okay

1430
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:36,590
well California is not done and in fact

1431
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,720
if you go further south so that we've

1432
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:40,670
been looking at Parker dam we go all the

1433
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,310
way down to there's another little tiny

1434
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:45,470
dam called an imperial dam and coming

1435
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:48,890
off of Imperial dam something called the

1436
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:50,420
All American canal I don't know exactly

1437
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:51,770
who named it but it's ironic

1438
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,109
that's right on the border with Mexico

1439
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:56,390
right right over here the all-american

1440
01:04:54,109 --> 01:04:57,680
canal and you see it branches up there's

1441
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,990
a whole bunch of branches that come off

1442
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:03,069
of this and there's actually hundreds of

1443
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:06,530
them I just drew a few of them on here

1444
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:07,790
if you would look at a satellite image

1445
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:10,569
of this part of the world

1446
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:13,400
so there's Central Valley of California

1447
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:16,460
okay and it's kind of green and there

1448
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:20,180
are dams in Northern California that

1449
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:21,680
bring water down and irrigate a lot of

1450
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,480
the fields plus they have a lot of wells

1451
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,750
there and they didn't notice it gets

1452
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:29,180
super dry right this is super dry we're

1453
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:33,530
in the desert here and then notice down

1454
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:38,540
here there's a blob of green there and

1455
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:40,819
blob of green there on the zoom in this

1456
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:44,119
blob of green right here there's that's

1457
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:47,020
the international boundary border right

1458
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:51,530
here this is called the Imperial Valley

1459
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:55,119
this and this and if you look right

1460
01:05:51,530 --> 01:06:01,220
there on if you can tell this or not

1461
01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:03,230
yeah these are sand dunes and this is

1462
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:06,130
what it looks like okay so this is a

1463
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:09,020
picture taken from that spot right there

1464
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:11,150
okay this is how dry this area is

1465
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:13,910
supposed to be remember we're in the

1466
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:16,960
area of the Pacific subtropical high for

1467
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:21,319
a big portion of the year very dry very

1468
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,829
hot you see nothing green in this

1469
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:26,270
picture

1470
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:27,920
right but by bringing in water for this

1471
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:30,230
all-american canal you can see it right

1472
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,440
there comes right through here and then

1473
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:35,770
this whole Green Zone is one of the

1474
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,720
richest agricultural areas in the world

1475
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:40,700
very likely you have eaten something

1476
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:43,609
today that has come from this area

1477
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:45,109
called the Imperial Valley and here

1478
01:06:43,609 --> 01:06:48,049
comes the all-american canal going

1479
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:50,180
through the sand dunes on its way

1480
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:52,400
through the desert until we get to this

1481
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:55,069
you can see you're super dry mountains

1482
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:58,670
in the distance very green fields up

1483
01:06:55,069 --> 01:07:02,030
ahead and all of these green fields here

1484
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:04,010
are being watered with Colorado River

1485
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:06,590
water it's a perfect

1486
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:10,010
to grow crops it's sunny almost every

1487
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:12,320
day it's warm the soil is good you just

1488
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:13,450
don't have any water problem solved

1489
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,280
we've got the all-american canal

1490
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:21,470
bringing in water down from the Colorado

1491
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:27,440
River so that's what's happening here

1492
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:30,470
and my question then is okay if if the

1493
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:34,040
Colorado River comes down and crosses

1494
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:37,610
into Mexico and then goes in dumps into

1495
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:39,290
the Gulf of California after we divert

1496
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:41,120
it through all these different canals

1497
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:41,830
and all these different dams and

1498
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,470
what-have-you

1499
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:47,450
what what's left when it crosses the

1500
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:50,290
border and what's left when it goes into

1501
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:54,590
the Gulf of California so I'm gonna look

1502
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:56,440
we're gonna zoom in right in here here's

1503
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:59,540
the international border right there

1504
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:02,210
this is the path of the Colorado and I'm

1505
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:05,840
gonna zoom in here for you and I'm gonna

1506
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:07,990
zoom in a little bit more right here

1507
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:13,400
zoom in a little more

1508
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:15,260
that's the Colorado River notice there's

1509
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,109
no River right you can see where people

1510
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:22,460
in spending donuts out here in the in

1511
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:25,880
the dust the Colorado River has not

1512
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:28,160
reached the ocean since 1983 except for

1513
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,009
a couple exceptions to that where they

1514
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:34,190
released a little bit of water so the

1515
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:37,549
Colorado River a hundred percent of the

1516
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:38,779
river is used up by people so and all

1517
01:08:37,549 --> 01:08:41,000
these different water projects were

1518
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:43,009
talking about the Colorado River split

1519
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,540
up all these different ways and if you

1520
01:08:43,009 --> 01:08:47,690
remember when we started talking about

1521
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:50,660
this I said that 1922 is a record wet

1522
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:52,520
year and nobody gets the amount of water

1523
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:55,730
they want everybody's arguing about it

1524
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:59,029
none of it gets to the ocean anymore in

1525
01:08:55,730 --> 01:09:01,670
that ecosystem from Neal from here South

1526
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:04,730
all the way in New Mexico that whole

1527
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:06,650
ecosystem around the river completely

1528
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:10,040
collapsed right because that all that

1529
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:13,720
water just got turned off so where the

1530
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:16,549
Colorado River has that 1922 agreement

1531
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,720
there was a similar agreement for the

1532
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:21,260
Rio Grande

1533
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:25,070
the Rio Grande compact and the Rio

1534
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:28,010
Grande itself starts out up here in

1535
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:30,140
Colorado then comes down through New

1536
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:33,530
Mexico and forms the border between

1537
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:36,830
Texas and Mexico right and so there's

1538
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:39,860
three American states that share the

1539
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:43,010
river and so there is a legal agreement

1540
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:46,730
as to how much each state gets from that

1541
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:51,290
River and so we also have several dams

1542
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:53,870
along the Rio Grande River and so if i

1543
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:56,090
zoom in a little bit so here comes the

1544
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:58,340
Rio Grande kinda makes this Big Bend as

1545
01:09:56,090 --> 01:10:02,000
it goes into New Mexico here's one

1546
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:04,940
Cochiti if you're from around here you

1547
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:08,090
might be familiar with Cochiti dam here

1548
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:11,710
comes the river and the river continues

1549
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:14,890
down here and there's the earthen dam

1550
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:18,050
Cochiti dam was built in the 70s and

1551
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:19,730
initially it was supposed to be a much

1552
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:22,610
bigger reservoir than what you see in

1553
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:24,650
this picture in fact if you look at this

1554
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:29,120
it looks like it needs a lot more water

1555
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:31,550
in it partly that's the drought partly

1556
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,420
because when they built this they kind

1557
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:34,670
of screwed up

1558
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:37,460
and it turns out that if you put too

1559
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:40,220
much water in this reservoir over here

1560
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:42,710
it comes boiling out of the ground over

1561
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:45,010
here and that's because they didn't

1562
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:49,130
study the subsurface geology correctly

1563
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:51,590
so this dam this reservoir will never

1564
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:54,260
get any higher really than what you see

1565
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:59,270
in this in these pictures but people

1566
01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:00,770
still use it and so Cochiti dam is is is

1567
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:02,570
is up here

1568
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:04,880
Albuquerque's right there and you need

1569
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:06,230
go all the way down here in the southern

1570
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,390
part of the state you can get to a

1571
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:10,790
couple of dams that are also pretty well

1572
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:14,300
known in particular Elephant Butte dam

1573
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:19,790
and Elephant Butte reservoir is actually

1574
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:21,950
a pretty old reservoir today after the

1575
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:25,300
Rio Grande compact its centrally like a

1576
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:28,460
holding pond for Texas meaning that

1577
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:31,800
Texas is legally entitled to a certain

1578
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:34,320
portion of the Rio Grande water

1579
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,090
and we as New Mexicans have to be able

1580
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,260
to deliver to them when they want that's

1581
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:41,520
part of the agreement

1582
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:44,580
so Elephant Butte is you know the

1583
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,220
reservoir itself is water that is

1584
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:49,230
waiting to go to Texas and then when

1585
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:52,560
they say we need them you know we need a

1586
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:55,920
hundred thousand acre feet we send it on

1587
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,810
down to them okay we've been in a

1588
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,060
drought situation for a long time and

1589
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:02,340
you can kind of see by the rings on this

1590
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:05,460
rock here that the lake level should be

1591
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:08,460
a lot higher than it is in fact it's

1592
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:11,880
only been a bit like a few percent full

1593
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:14,370
for the last several years now one of

1594
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:19,260
the problems is similar to Lake Mead

1595
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:22,740
here you have desert area it's hot it's

1596
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:25,890
dry low relative humidity lots of

1597
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:29,010
surface area right so how much are we

1598
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:31,530
losing in evaporation each year a lot

1599
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:33,660
right and if we're giving in legal

1600
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:35,340
trouble with Texas because if we don't

1601
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:37,170
have enough water to send the Texas and

1602
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:40,290
we can get fined we have to pay them and

1603
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:44,280
who wants to pay Texas so we have to

1604
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:45,600
have a way to prevent losing so much

1605
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:47,790
water and people have been working on

1606
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,750
like what what could we do to prevent

1607
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:54,750
all this evaporation and so this sounds

1608
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:57,380
crazy but one idea might be to cover the

1609
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:59,460
entire lake with like ping-pong balls

1610
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:02,040
now these are not ping-pong balls

1611
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:04,290
they're bigger this is a reservoir in

1612
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,240
California where they're they've been

1613
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:08,640
they've had a water crisis there forever

1614
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:12,120
and they decided that they would cover

1615
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:15,360
the entire lake with these plastic balls

1616
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:18,450
and it forms a layer and prevents

1617
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,040
evaporation rate so we might have to do

1618
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:24,870
something like that with a Elephant

1619
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:27,120
Butte someday now here's a magazine ad

1620
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:30,240
this is pretty low quality it's the only

1621
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:32,880
one I can find it says name a great

1622
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:35,790
American city on a large body of water

1623
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,080
and it shows a guy windsurfing out here

1624
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:38,580
and you look at those buildings in the

1625
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:41,130
background and I know it's a really

1626
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:43,020
crappy image but is there anything back

1627
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:45,240
there you might recognize because this

1628
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:48,720
is supposed to be a picture

1629
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:51,390
downtown Albuquerque and it may seem

1630
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:53,250
crazy to us now but there is a time when

1631
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:56,280
they were advertising people to please

1632
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:59,160
come here because we have so much water

1633
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:02,790
yeah we're in a desert but guess what

1634
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:05,040
underneath Albuquerque huge amounts of

1635
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:07,320
groundwater so much groundwater is as

1636
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:11,400
much as a great lake much as Lake Erie

1637
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:14,370
something like that well back then in

1638
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:17,040
the 80s they did some research and they

1639
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:18,980
decided that yes there's this huge

1640
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:21,330
reservoir of groundwater beneath us

1641
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:24,060
bigger it you know I guess at Lake Erie

1642
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:26,700
size body of water this is something

1643
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:28,290
called a cross-section and so you're

1644
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:30,180
you're you're cutting the earth in half

1645
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:32,610
and you're looking at it from the side

1646
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:35,760
here's the Sandia's northeast heights

1647
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:38,220
there's the river then there's West Mesa

1648
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,850
over here so Rio Rancho is over here

1649
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:45,180
right and this is has what we call a

1650
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:47,400
high vertical exaggeration so you know

1651
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:50,100
how was the distance here it's it's you

1652
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,890
know I don't know 10 miles but what is

1653
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:56,480
this distance right one mile from here

1654
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:58,590
to here so it's been vertically

1655
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:02,100
exaggerated much more than the

1656
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:04,380
horizontal scale so point is though they

1657
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:06,630
thought all of this was groundwater down

1658
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:08,460
here and they thought this because they

1659
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:09,930
draw the few they drilled a few wells

1660
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,640
and I kept finding groundwater and

1661
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:15,450
they're like oh this is great there's

1662
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:19,020
Lake Erie underneath the ground here but

1663
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:22,800
then they did some more studies after

1664
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:24,960
they published those magazine ads and

1665
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,680
they realized that oh actually it's a

1666
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:30,180
pretty small amount of groundwater and

1667
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,710
it's really really old like the water

1668
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,280
down here is like ten thousand years old

1669
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:37,380
it's left over from the last ice age and

1670
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:41,070
what's it like under say oh I don't know

1671
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:43,320
Rio Rancho a whole lot of nothing and so

1672
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:46,980
all these people are removing hid here

1673
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:49,080
Intel set up Rio Rancho and all that and

1674
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:51,960
they realized oh wait we don't actually

1675
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:54,570
have any groundwater in the groundwater

1676
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,910
that we do have we have to drill deeper

1677
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:59,040
and deeper and deeper and our wells are

1678
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:02,490
well over 500 feet deep

1679
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:06,860
to get to groundwater what are we going

1680
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:10,620
to do so on the original 1922 compact

1681
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:13,890
they are entitled to a portion of the

1682
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:16,410
Colorado River water even though as we

1683
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:19,110
said before the Colorado River does not

1684
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:22,140
go through the state of New Mexico but

1685
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:23,340
we're in the watershed so these three

1686
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:24,750
rivers and there's actually a whole

1687
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:29,040
bunch of little ones but these three are

1688
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:32,130
the larger ones these feed in to the San

1689
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,660
Juan which this is Navajo dam here but

1690
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:36,510
this is the San Juan River and that

1691
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:40,740
eventually dumps into the Colorado River

1692
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:42,780
and so legally we're entitled to a

1693
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:45,930
portion of the Colorado River water but

1694
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:47,910
we don't have to drill a hole and run a

1695
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:50,730
pipe all the way to the Colorado River

1696
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:52,770
what we can do is we can take water out

1697
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:56,040
of these rivers these tributaries that

1698
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:59,040
feed the Colorado River we can take

1699
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,720
water from their second problem how do

1700
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,640
we get it to Albuquerque where we need

1701
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:05,640
it well we're on the wrong side of the

1702
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,650
Continental Divide so here's the

1703
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:09,600
Continental Divide which is green on

1704
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:13,080
this map I believe it's pink on maybe on

1705
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:15,630
your map so the water naturally wants to

1706
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:17,550
run to the west we needed to get over

1707
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:20,820
here to the east so we're going to use a

1708
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:22,380
trick from Colorado's book and we're

1709
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:24,570
going to drill holes underneath the

1710
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:27,420
mountain and we're going to drop that

1711
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:29,730
water into the Chama River which is then

1712
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:32,040
going to flow down and dump into the Rio

1713
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:34,380
Grande which is then gonna take it all

1714
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,210
the way to Albuquerque this is called

1715
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:38,220
the San Juan Chama drinking water

1716
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:40,500
project okay so here's those three

1717
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:43,230
rivers that dump into the San Juan which

1718
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,960
dumps into the Colorado we're gonna put

1719
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:47,820
26 miles of tunnels through the

1720
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,470
mountains and come out the other side in

1721
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:53,340
dump and there's a couple of little

1722
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:55,290
reservoirs over here along the Chama but

1723
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:58,590
eventually that water gets down and

1724
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:59,010
joins the Rio Grande and then makes its

1725
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,990
way

1726
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:05,310
first through Kochi and then eventually

1727
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:07,410
down to Albuquerque so this is what it

1728
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:09,510
looks like on your map I've got this red

1729
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:10,470
line here representing those tunnels San

1730
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:12,820
Juan Chama

1731
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:15,070
diversion okay so it's another train

1732
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:17,860
mountain diversion waters supposed to

1733
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:20,139
land on west of the Continental Divide

1734
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:21,760
but we're going to redirect it east

1735
01:18:20,139 --> 01:18:23,409
through the divide and out the other

1736
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:28,420
side with where these tiny little dams

1737
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:29,889
are so unlike California we're not going

1738
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,940
to have a big long pipe that goes

1739
01:18:29,889 --> 01:18:32,650
hundreds of miles

1740
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:34,810
unlike Arizona we're not going to have

1741
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:37,300
canal that goes hundreds of miles what

1742
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:38,980
we're going to do is we're going to have

1743
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:41,050
tunnels through the mountain but then

1744
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:44,560
we're going to use the natural rivers to

1745
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:47,969
take that water to Albuquerque here's

1746
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:50,230
where the water goes under the mountain

1747
01:18:47,969 --> 01:18:52,659
into the tunnels or enters into the

1748
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:55,690
tunnels kind of here's where it comes

1749
01:18:52,659 --> 01:18:58,000
out the other side here on Dam and then

1750
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:59,770
eventually it comes all the way down the

1751
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,170
Rio Grande and it gets to Albuquerque

1752
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:04,000
does anybody want to drink water out of

1753
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:06,190
the Rio Grande no they do not

1754
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,949
so part of this project is you also had

1755
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:11,079
to build a world-class water filtration

1756
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:13,210
system for this water because what's

1757
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:14,800
going to happen is that water comes down

1758
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:16,840
the Rio Grande and we just pump it out

1759
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:20,829
of the river and ultimately we want to

1760
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:23,079
drink this so here's where the what here

1761
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:25,179
comes the water down the Rio Grande

1762
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:26,500
there's a little dam you can't even see

1763
01:19:25,179 --> 01:19:28,420
it it goes up and down it's right

1764
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:31,150
through here they raise it up when they

1765
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:33,460
wouldn't take water out they lower it

1766
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:35,829
down when they don't if their Dam is

1767
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:37,900
raised and the fish are coming by and

1768
01:19:35,829 --> 01:19:39,909
they can't get around little problem we

1769
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:43,869
got a little fish passage where they can

1770
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:46,179
go around the dam and this is our water

1771
01:19:43,869 --> 01:19:47,770
treatment facility and if you're

1772
01:19:46,179 --> 01:19:50,199
familiar with Albuquerque it's kind of

1773
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:52,380
round the Renaissance area so there's

1774
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:54,880
like a home depot and stuff around there

1775
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:57,190
big old building but what they're doing

1776
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:00,429
is they're taking all kinds of stuff out

1777
01:19:57,190 --> 01:20:02,380
of the water and making it drinkable and

1778
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:04,780
then from there it gets pumped through

1779
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:07,540
throughout the city there's a second

1780
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:09,550
system that takes river water that's not

1781
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:12,070
treated and it takes it to golf courses

1782
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:14,260
and parks all right so don't drink the

1783
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:18,760
water out of the sprinklers because it

1784
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:21,190
may be untreated river water so this was

1785
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:24,849
started you know this project took a

1786
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:26,949
long time to build and and alongside of

1787
01:20:24,849 --> 01:20:29,199
that was this big

1788
01:20:26,949 --> 01:20:33,550
citywide project to get people to save

1789
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:35,409
water so back in the mid-90s your

1790
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:39,400
average person in Albuquerque was

1791
01:20:35,409 --> 01:20:42,639
consuming 250 gallons of water a day now

1792
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,559
that's mostly outdoor watering okay so a

1793
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,239
lot of this is convincing people that

1794
01:20:44,559 --> 01:20:49,840
they don't need these big lush green

1795
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:51,550
lawns but there is a big campaign if you

1796
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,130
lived in Albuquerque you may remember

1797
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:56,170
there's lots of billboards about try not

1798
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:59,349
to you know you try to save water try

1799
01:20:56,170 --> 01:21:03,400
not to take long showers etc etc and

1800
01:20:59,349 --> 01:21:04,929
they got to by 2011 they got there to

1801
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,210
their goal of a hundred and fifty

1802
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:09,429
gallons per person per day which just

1803
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:11,590
still seems like a lot if you lined up

1804
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:13,599
150 gallons of water we think I use that

1805
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:14,889
every single day that's all still seems

1806
01:21:13,599 --> 01:21:16,750
like a lot compared to the rest of the

1807
01:21:14,889 --> 01:21:20,050
world but it's a hundred gallons less

1808
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:22,869
than what we started and so there is a

1809
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:26,829
campaign for that and then we slowly

1810
01:21:22,869 --> 01:21:29,710
switched off from the well water to this

1811
01:21:26,829 --> 01:21:32,380
the San Juan Chama water and it wasn't

1812
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:35,739
immediate they keep increasing the

1813
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:40,030
proportion of San Juan Chama water so

1814
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:44,949
this is a couple tables of depth to the

1815
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:48,099
water table 538 542 that's how many feet

1816
01:21:44,949 --> 01:21:50,110
down you'd have to drill to get to the

1817
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:52,960
water table in a couple of different

1818
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:55,539
areas in Albuquerque and so we see this

1819
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,770
kind of bump here over these waves

1820
01:21:55,539 --> 01:22:02,800
that's the wet dry wet dry season and

1821
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:05,800
then we see about 2007 is when we start

1822
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,840
to transition over we start shutting

1823
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:11,320
these wells down and we see the water

1824
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:13,239
table starting to rebound and you know

1825
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:15,130
it's still 500 feet below the ground

1826
01:22:13,239 --> 01:22:17,139
it's gonna take a really really long

1827
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:19,440
time for that to rebound all the way to

1828
01:22:17,139 --> 01:22:21,699
where it used to be but point being

1829
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:25,000
because we switched over the San Juan

1830
01:22:21,699 --> 01:22:27,460
Chama water our water tables are slowly

1831
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,050
starting to rise back up they'll take

1832
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:33,880
decades for them to get back to where

1833
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:36,989
they used to be so what allows us to

1834
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:39,639
stay here in Albuquerque San Juan Chama

1835
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:40,270
project that's what as actually allowing

1836
01:22:39,639 --> 01:22:41,620
us to have

1837
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:45,040
water every time we turn that the

1838
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:47,320
faucets on every city in the southwest

1839
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:49,360
has a story right

1840
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:51,580
the reason Phoenix can exist where it

1841
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,890
does the reason Las Vegas can exist

1842
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:55,960
where it does the reason Los Angeles can

1843
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:58,900
exist where it does are because these

1844
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:01,810
very major what we call water projects

1845
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:03,820
dams and reservoirs and aqueducts and

1846
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:06,070
canals and tunnels through mountains and

1847
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:08,380
all these things so there's this huge

1848
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,820
network of these projects that are

1849
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:12,580
millions and millions and billions of

1850
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:16,390
dollars have been invested to make this

1851
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:18,850
work there's a financial cost there's an

1852
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:21,730
environmental cost right we lost Owens

1853
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:23,710
Lake we lost half a Mono Lake the

1854
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,160
Colorado River no longer reaches the

1855
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:27,520
ocean

1856
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:29,440
we've got dams all over the place so

1857
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,930
there's an environmental cost for all of

1858
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,090
this as well but this is just sort of

1859
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:36,640
basic introduction to the big water

1860
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:40,530
projects that allow us to live in the

1861
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:40,530
driest place in the country

1862
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,340
