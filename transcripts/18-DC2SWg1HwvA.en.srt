1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,460
hey this is Mel and this lecture is on

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,280
greenhouse gases and the greenhouse

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,900
effect before we get into the greenhouse

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,130
stuff we're going to talk a little bit

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,310
about light and one of the ideas in

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,470
light is that light travels in waves

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,529
so there's several things in physics

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,500
that travel as ways so for example we

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,600
have sound waves right earthquake waves

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,090
so energy can propagate as waves

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,050
sometimes and light is one of those

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,480
things so if you think about what a wave

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:51,510
would look like so I'm just going to

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:54,710
draw some waves here so now when we get

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,989
into waves in physics there's some

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,629
terminology that we use a lot and one of

17
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,430
them is something called wavelength so

18
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,860
if I had a bunch of waves here and I

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:09,180
measure the distance between two

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:13,439
consecutive parts on a wave we call that

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:17,130
the wavelength so for example from

22
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,680
trough to trough or crest to crest

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,180
that's the literally the length of the

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,150
wave so light is made of waves that are

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,310
so small that you can't see them how

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,070
small are they so you can imagine if you

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,380
took a meter stick and you divide it

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,720
into million pieces and then you take

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,810
one of those pieces and you divide it

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,210
into about 10 to 50 pieces and take one

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,990
of those pieces that's about the length

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,860
of a wavelength of light okay so these

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,479
are sub microscopic waves right so we

34
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,159
think of them and we draw them like this

35
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,030
but we can't actually see the waves

36
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,170
themselves there's everything that's way

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,869
too microscopic okay

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,930
these waves the way our eyes and brains

39
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,690
are set up is what we perceive as color

40
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,690
are actually different wavelengths of

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,980
light so when I see red light that's a

42
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,540
certain wavelength when I

43
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,519
say blue light that's a different

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,920
wavelength the waves are physically

45
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,549
different sizes and our eyes and brains

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:33,540
interpret that as a color okay so what

47
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm gonna do is we're gonna draw if we

48
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,980
could look at all of the waves from the

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:44,459
Sun okay so I'm gonna make a graph here

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,860
on the x-axis are the waves shorter

51
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,160
waves are down here longer waves over

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,560
here and on the y-axis is intensity so

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,970
we're gonna look at all the light coming

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,269
from the Sun they were gonna make a

55
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:07,530
graph now I did so it would kind of look

56
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:09,569
like this so it's not symmetrical

57
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,190
there's a peak and then there's this

58
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,530
really long tail that actually goes on

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,000
forever off the page and if I drew it

60
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,620
correctly it would never come down to

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,819
zero but I kind of screwed up there a

62
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,569
little bit okay so let's explain kind of

63
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,750
what this means

64
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:28,109
on this end these are the waves coming

65
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,519
from the Sun that are really short so

66
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm gonna draw a little line kind of

67
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,340
right here because it turns out those

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,829
waves are too short for our eyes to see

69
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,130
then we start to get into waves that our

70
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:48,709
eyes can see and the shortest ones that

71
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:51,150
we can see our eyes interpret that as

72
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:55,260
violet so I'm just gonna shade this

73
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,299
cover violet purple cover and then

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,840
eventually as these waves get longer and

75
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,720
longer we interpret them to be more of a

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,720
blue color so I'm gonna put some blue in

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,859
here and I'm not gonna draw every color

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,799
that we can see I'm just kind of

79
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:17,310
generalizing here okay so then as the

80
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:23,490
waves get longer they turn more and more

81
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:40,180
of a green color so I'm gonna draw

82
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:43,300
some green Hey and then as they get

83
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:51,840
longer still we start to get into the

84
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:51,840
yellow and then we get into some orange

85
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:15,430
which then turns more and more towards a

86
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:17,590
red color okay so something like this so

87
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,140
I'm gonna put another little dashed line

88
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,940
right there

89
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:26,890
so roughly and this is really rough but

90
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,530
the idea is that over here we've got

91
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,930
waves that are too short to see then we

92
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,300
get into violet then in the blues greens

93
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,600
and then as the waves get longer and

94
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,350
longer we eventually see that as red and

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:45,520
eventually they are too long to see okay

96
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:53,530
now the ones that are too long to see we

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:57,580
call those infra red sometimes we

98
00:05:53,530 --> 00:06:03,870
abbreviate this as IR and the waves that

99
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:14,110
are too short to see we call those ultra

100
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:15,750
violet or UV so UV is this entire region

101
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,310
in here

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,390
infrared is this entire region that goes

103
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,030
off the page

104
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,590
let's talk about UV first so we've

105
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,990
talked about UV in the past we talked

106
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,040
about the ozone layer and how the ozone

107
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:34,560
layer blocks most but not quite all of

108
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,460
the UV from hitting the surface right so

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,460
UV

110
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,440
light comes in hits an ozone own so

111
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,540
breaks apart eventually gets back

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,350
together that releases heat to the

113
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,440
stratosphere okay so this little segment

114
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:54,550
right here

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,139
of UV is the UV that gets through it's

116
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:00,280
the UV that gets all the way to the

117
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:03,280
surface and the UV out here this is the

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:08,740
UV that's blocked by the ozone layer

119
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,660
okay so this whole the the shorter these

120
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,389
shorter waves it turns out have more

121
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,169
energy and they're more dangerous to us

122
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:19,960
so for us

123
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:22,300
things like x-rays and gamma rays those

124
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,100
are even shorter than this unfortunately

125
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,910
we have very few of those coming into

126
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,400
the atmosphere from the Sun but those

127
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,470
are very dangerous and then the longer

128
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,280
the wavelength is it turns out the safer

129
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,320
it is for for us for our bodies okay so

130
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,560
you don't want to get whacked with UV

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,000
radiation it's okay to get whacked with

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,530
visible radiation which is what we call

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,490
this part in here this is the part that

134
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:50,340
we can see then we get up here to these

135
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,440
longer wavelengths and now we're back to

136
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,349
waves that we can no longer see now the

137
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:03,700
ones that are pretty close to red in

138
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:05,620
here we call this near-infrared and the

139
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,539
ones that are way out here on this tail

140
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,550
we call these far infrared so everything

141
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,610
in the tail is infrared

142
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,440
NIR is this these guys far and it goes

143
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,550
goes on and on and on on this page goes

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,919
on forever

145
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:26,320
okay also when you get far out on this

146
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,840
tail and it's kind of off the page but

147
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:35,409
I'm going to draw it here anyway you get

148
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:37,770
to some radiation that is it we can't

149
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:41,409
see it but we have another sense for it

150
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:43,180
you would call this heat so if you were

151
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,240
up to let's say you walk up to a wall

152
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,829
and the wall is hot you have a sense

153
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,290
that it's hot without actually having to

154
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,060
touch it right like you can you can you

155
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,370
since it on your face like you feel

156
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:02,949
something and out here we call this

157
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:04,660
sensible heat not sensible because it

158
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:06,579
has good sense but sensible and that

159
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,050
it's not if you remember back some

160
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,759
lectures we talked about latent heat

161
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:14,199
latent heat is heat that is hidden

162
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,279
sensible heat is not hidden you can

163
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:20,199
touch it and feel it so what we perceive

164
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,759
as and what we talk about is sensible

165
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:24,670
heat that touched something warm and

166
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,910
feels warm that is actually I'm feeling

167
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:30,190
these waves way out here our eyes can't

168
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,370
see them now it's worth pointing out

169
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:36,130
that some animals can see other waves

170
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:41,589
that we cannot write so we can't see

171
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:43,930
near-infrared right here but snakes for

172
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:46,449
example pit vipers they have this little

173
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,839
pit on their head and it's a sensor and

174
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:52,089
they can see things that are warm and

175
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,889
they're kind of seeing they don't really

176
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:56,560
see this out here but they kind of see

177
00:09:53,889 --> 00:10:00,610
the near-infrared part of that a lot of

178
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,790
insects can see UV out here and so I

179
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:07,510
helps them see different flowers so our

180
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,980
our world is the visible you know the

181
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,260
vit what we call the visible light world

182
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,510
these are the ways that we see but we're

183
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,760
surrounded with these other waves that

184
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:22,300
we cannot so with that I'm going to then

185
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,800
move to talk about how this what this

186
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,310
has anything they do with greenhouse

187
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,560
effect what we do when we talked about

188
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,100
the greenhouse effect is we take all of

189
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,800
these waves and we group them into two

190
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:42,000
categories we basically say that

191
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:50,500
everything from about here onward is

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,959
called shortwave radiation okay and so

193
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,990
sometimes that means all the visible and

194
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,360
UV sometimes people also include the

195
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,199
near-infrared but it's the majority this

196
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,430
hump that's the shortwave radiation and

197
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:08,830
everything to the right of this

198
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:12,339
is long-wave radiation so that is this

199
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,410
long tail that again it's it's much it's

200
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,860
much longer than I'm showing here goes

201
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,420
off the page so all the waves to the

202
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,540
right of this we call long wave

203
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,420
radiation all the ways to the left of

204
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:29,200
this we call short wave radiation okay

205
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,510
so we're gonna talk about short wave

206
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,360
radiation long wave radiation and just

207
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,209
keep in mind when you hear short wave

208
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,459
it's the stuff you see with the UV when

209
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,260
you see long wave radiation it's these

210
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,690
really long waves that you can't see but

211
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,050
you might be able to feel as sensible

212
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,540
heat so one of the things that happens

213
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,050
on earth is that shortwave radiation

214
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,050
comes in from the Sun and the earth

215
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,600
absorbs that and turns it into long wave

216
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:02,110
radiation okay so the way I would draw

217
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,540
that is so here's the surface there's

218
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,980
the Sun and mostly what comes in from

219
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:11,160
the Sun is shortwave radiation that's

220
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,250
the big hump of radiation we just drew

221
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,560
and it comes down and it goes through

222
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,750
space unaffected goes through the

223
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,120
atmosphere mostly unaffected hits the

224
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:27,279
ground and the ground absorbs this and

225
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:31,690
then the ground turns it into a long

226
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:35,470
wave radiation and so coming off of the

227
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:39,270
ground beaming back into space is long

228
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,270
wave radiation so this is the long wave

229
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,529
this is the short way

230
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:54,940
okay so remember that from the previous

231
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,090
diagram shortwave that's all mostly the

232
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,650
visible plus a little bit on each side

233
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,690
what's coming back what's coming off the

234
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:05,050
earth is a stuff way out here including

235
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,060
the heat that you can feel so you can

236
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,300
kind of think of the earth is converting

237
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,780
one type of radiation to the other we

238
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:17,050
see visible light weak comes in hits the

239
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:21,190
ground turns into heat that you can feel

240
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:23,500
so here's an illustration sun's out turn

241
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,250
you back to the Sun you back gets warm

242
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,560
why it's not heat coming from the Sun

243
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,110
it's shortwave radiation coming from the

244
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,810
Sun your heat your back absorbs that

245
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,410
turns it into long wave and then you can

246
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,370
sense it

247
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,980
so objects that are in the sunlight

248
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,960
take that shortwave radiation convert it

249
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,000
to a long wave radiation now in the

250
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,300
earth this long wave radiation is

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,100
beaming back out into space okay so if

252
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,220
you have any object floating out in

253
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,310
space earth the moon whatever it absorbs

254
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,840
the shortwave beams long wave back so

255
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,570
you if you're floating around out in

256
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,700
space and you had a thermometer you

257
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,520
could point it at the earth you would

258
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,740
measure this coming off of it so the

259
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,310
earth is like beaming this long wave

260
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,560
radiation out in space kind of like how

261
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,860
the Sun beams shortwave radiation out

262
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,090
into space okay so this is what's going

263
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:24,850
on with the earth so with that we're

264
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,310
going to investigate what greenhouse

265
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,540
what the greenhouse gas what a

266
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,450
greenhouse gas is and what the

267
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,650
greenhouse effect is and all that so

268
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,450
this is another one of the Phet

269
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,330
simulations it's called the greenhouse

270
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,370
effect and what we have here is a box

271
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,990
and I can put a different kind of

272
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:46,840
molecule on the box so nitrogen oxygen

273
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:49,450
water co2 whatever and I've got a

274
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,120
flashlight that can shoot either

275
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,800
shortwave radiation or long-wave

276
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,410
radiation now what they're calling it

277
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,810
here is they're calling it infrared so

278
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,819
that's a long wave radiation and I can

279
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,489
turn on the slider and it's

280
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:06,239
start shooting well we call photons a

281
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:08,649
little packets of light that are either

282
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,939
so what they're calling infrared we just

283
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,709
call it a long way so these are a long

284
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:15,220
way this is little packets a long wave

285
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:16,629
radiation or I can switch it to the

286
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,799
visible light which is the shortwave

287
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,809
radiation okay

288
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,399
and it shows whether what it's showing

289
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:24,189
here is that the photons are just

290
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,649
passing right through my oxygen molecule

291
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:30,009
and nothing's happening and I can switch

292
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:32,679
this to nitrogen and again no matter

293
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:38,109
what I do the different types of light

294
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:39,850
just go right through so so far nothing

295
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:42,009
really interesting is happening what's

296
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,410
our atmosphere made out of roughly

297
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:47,499
eighty percent nitrogen twenty percent

298
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,789
oxygen and so when I put these molecules

299
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:54,399
in there nothing happens right okay so

300
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:56,979
let's say I change this though and I'm

301
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:02,169
gonna put in a water molecule okay so I

302
00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:04,629
got water molecules and so just remind

303
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,789
you there's the the two oxygen sorry the

304
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,049
two hydrogen's on one side and it kind

305
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,539
of has that Mickey Mouse head shape we

306
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:13,389
talked about in the past so if I change

307
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:15,489
this to shoot long wave radiation at it

308
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,499
I notice that finally something's

309
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:21,399
different starts happening and once in a

310
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:25,449
while the water molecule absorbs one of

311
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,509
those photons of long wave radiation it

312
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:30,269
gets excited it wiggles and then it

313
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:34,959
shoots it off in some random direction

314
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:36,519
okay so as I sit here and watch this you

315
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,519
know if I was standing behind this

316
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:43,089
flashlight doing this once in a while

317
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,289
one of those red photons of long wave

318
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:48,329
radiation would come back towards me now

319
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:51,129
we just said that long wave radiation

320
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:53,799
includes sensible heat which you can

321
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:55,749
feel alright so if you can imagine me

322
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,369
shooting these little photons of long

323
00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:00,249
wave radiation at this water molecule

324
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:02,229
and occasionally one of them comes back

325
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:05,529
towards me like that one right there

326
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:08,470
then my experience as the guy behind the

327
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:11,860
flashlight is I feel the warmth of that

328
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,360
little photons coming back okay so I'm

329
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,530
gonna make a bunch of them

330
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,990
let's build a nap

331
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:21,660
fear I'm gonna put a bunch of waters out

332
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:26,320
here and I'm gonna turn on my flashlight

333
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:29,950
America and I start spraying this box of

334
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,740
water molecules with photons of long

335
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,870
wave radiation and as I stand back here

336
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,580
I'll notice that occasionally some of

337
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:41,860
them come back towards me okay this is

338
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,160
what we call the greenhouse effect and

339
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:49,390
water is a greenhouse gas because it

340
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,790
does this not all gases do this so I

341
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:56,140
just Illustrated this but if I had a

342
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:56,680
bunch of let me take my waters back come

343
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,740
on

344
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,130
and I'm going to increase my got a bunch

345
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:08,740
of oxygens and I got a bunch of

346
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:13,300
nitrogen's and now I will shoot those

347
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:15,100
guys and that the the long wave

348
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,200
radiation just passes right through and

349
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,960
you sees molecules just don't care

350
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,640
nothing's happening so none of those

351
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,060
photons are getting reflected back

352
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:28,240
towards me at any point on the other

353
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:32,170
hand if I went to let's get rid of my

354
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:40,210
nitrogen let's get rid of my oxygen come

355
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:42,250
on and I could put in some co2 so co2 is

356
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,950
another one of these molecules that acts

357
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,950
as a greenhouse gas you can see they get

358
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,990
excited occasionally and they shoot off

359
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,570
a photon in some random direction and

360
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:59,200
that random direction might be back

361
00:18:52,570 --> 00:19:02,170
towards where I am methane nothing isn't

362
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,610
as a CH floor has carbon with four

363
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:11,700
hydrogen's so I go back here and make a

364
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:11,700
atmosphere with methane and

365
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,549
so as I shoot the methane with the

366
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:23,410
long-wave radiation you can see it also

367
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:24,240
gets partly absorbed and reflects back

368
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,620
towards me

369
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,170
it's also worth pointing out that if I

370
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,140
put the flashlight on visible so

371
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:38,250
shortwave radiation and I fill up the

372
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:38,250
atmosphere with nitrogen and oxygen that

373
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:45,370
the shortwave radiation goes through the

374
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:53,940
atmosphere completely unaffected and if

375
00:19:45,370 --> 00:20:00,760
I put in greenhouse gases so methane co2

376
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:02,020
water that nothing is affected here in

377
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,970
other words the shortwave radiation

378
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,340
pretty much just goes right through the

379
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,669
atmosphere so it's coming from the Sun

380
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:13,150
goes to the atmosphere does not interact

381
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:17,260
with hardly any gases it's the long-wave

382
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:18,429
radiation that is interacting with the

383
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,429
greenhouse gases

384
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:23,860
okay so oxygen nitrogen no interaction

385
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:26,200
whatsoever with anything the greenhouse

386
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,470
gases and so far we've seen co2 water

387
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,500
and methane do interact with a long wave

388
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,500
radiation

389
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,790
okay so let's return back to this

390
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:39,160
diagram that we just drew and what we

391
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,950
have drawn here is a scenario on a

392
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:45,130
planet that has no greenhouse gases so

393
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:48,580
let's just say our atmosphere was oxygen

394
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:51,010
nitrogen we have no greenhouse gases or

395
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,799
maybe no atmosphere at all shortwave

396
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,140
radiation comes in hits the ground goes

397
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:59,200
back out into space as long wave

398
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:02,820
radiation if the earth had no greenhouse

399
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:07,559
gases whatsoever just oxygen nitrogen

400
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,559
then our average temperature

401
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:19,070
the entire planet is somewhere around

402
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,799
four degrees Fahrenheit okay

403
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,480
so this takes into this is the whole

404
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,190
earth now so it's the poles is the

405
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,720
equator it's the summers it's the

406
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,030
winters the days of the night it's all

407
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,330
thrown together you get a number about

408
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:35,059
four degrees Fahrenheit so pretty close

409
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:38,210
to zero Fahrenheit what's what would the

410
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:40,580
earth be like if the average temperature

411
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,770
is about zero that means you're looking

412
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,080
at an earth that is essentially entirely

413
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:48,200
frozen the oceans would probably be

414
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,840
frozen completely over right so that's

415
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,659
what it would be like if we had no

416
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,299
greenhouse gases okay so now let's let's

417
00:21:53,659 --> 00:22:00,730
take this scenario and let's add one

418
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:05,059
thing what if we had a planet that had

419
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:10,309
clouds okay so we're just gonna do that

420
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:15,049
first so redraw okay so in this scenario

421
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:20,120
we have clouds and so I'm gonna draw

422
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:20,720
these as some physical objects in the

423
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,010
sky

424
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,640
okay and what happens

425
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,919
well shortwave radiation still comes

426
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:39,370
down from the Sun as before which I'm

427
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:42,350
drawing is blue and clouds will reflect

428
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,270
some of that shortwave radiation back

429
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,390
out into space okay so that's a

430
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:50,590
possibility and one of the things that

431
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:54,980
we'll do is that will help cool it down

432
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:57,559
during the day right so cloudy day

433
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,179
usually not as hot it's because we're we

434
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:06,200
are reflecting some of that shortwave

435
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:08,210
radiation back out into space but the

436
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,090
the short way some of it still gets to

437
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:15,919
the ground and still turns into long

438
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:19,250
wave and long wave then heads out into

439
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720
space just like before but the

440
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,140
difference now is that we have some

441
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,809
clouds so as so so some of it

442
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,659
we'll make it all about the space right

443
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:34,929
that will mix it up of space but maybe

444
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:38,960
this one hits this cloud and some of it

445
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:43,640
goes through but some of it reflects

446
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,570
back this one hits the cloud some of it

447
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:51,320
goes through some of it reflects back

448
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:57,740
okay so if you are an observer on the

449
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:59,690
ground down here so we're sitting we're

450
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,730
saying this is the same planet as before

451
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,880
so the planet before had no greenhouse

452
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,250
gases it was zero degrees the person on

453
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,100
that previous planet could feel the

454
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:12,169
warmth coming up from the surface this

455
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,960
person also feels the warmth coming up

456
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:17,210
from the surface but but now there's a

457
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,159
little portion of it that's coming down

458
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:28,090
from above so in other words this little

459
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:31,130
reflection may come down and hit you and

460
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:35,230
you now feel like there's a little bit

461
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:39,169
of warmth coming up from those clouds so

462
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:40,490
the presence of clouds and so we've kind

463
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:41,919
of skipped greenhouse gases here for a

464
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:52,240
little bit but the presence of clouds

465
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:56,049
means that you will have cooler days but

466
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,049
you'll have warmer nights

467
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,460
okay so generally speaking if it's

468
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,669
clutch you know especially in the winter

469
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,980
if it's cloudy at night it's gonna be

470
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,230
much warmer at night than it is if it's

471
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,860
clearer at night because a lot of this

472
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:14,240
long wave radiation that's coming up is

473
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,429
reflecting off of these clouds and

474
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
coming back towards you and so just to

475
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:22,789
be clear make sure what I'm doing here

476
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,919
all my red ones those are all long long

477
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,889
wave radiation going out towards this

478
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,350
toward space so so so the big picture

479
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:33,350
here is everything is the same as before

480
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,809
except these clouds are going to cause

481
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,640
some reflections some reflections of

482
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:39,980
shortwave back out into space

483
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,900
makes things cooler some reflection of

484
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,290
long wave radiation coming back down

485
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:48,860
makes things warmer so the big picture

486
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:51,250
is a cloudy planet going to be warmer at

487
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,610
night probably cooler during the day

488
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:58,070
okay so now here's our third scenario

489
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:59,690
now we have an atmosphere that has some

490
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,450
greenhouse gases and I've drawn some

491
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:05,270
greenhouse gases here I've not drawn in

492
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,730
oxygen in nitrogen because as we've just

493
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,590
kind of demonstrated they have nothing

494
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,100
to do with either a long wave or

495
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,990
shortwave radiation so I'm not drawing

496
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,880
them I just threw in some some

497
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,430
greenhouse gases we've got some methane

498
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:24,670
we've got some water we got some co2

499
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:27,320
okay so what happens in this scenario

500
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:33,190
shortwave radiation still comes in from

501
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,190
the Sun so here's my shortwave coming in

502
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:44,600
and long-wave radiation

503
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,930
heads out to space from the from the

504
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,420
surface and as it goes out you know some

505
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:52,880
of it comes out and goes all the way

506
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,540
until it you know it goes all the way

507
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,060
out into space and sometimes it will

508
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:01,670
interact with one of these greenhouse

509
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,470
gases so back to the animation where the

510
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,510
greenhouse gas got excited and wiggled

511
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,150
and it shot that photon in a random

512
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,450
direction well that's what's happening

513
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,130
here

514
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,950
this outgoing there's my long wave

515
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:20,510
coming out is going to interact with

516
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:23,680
this co2 co2 gets excited Wiggles shoots

517
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:28,840
out a photon in some random direction

518
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:32,200
okay and this is happening all

519
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:38,270
throughout here where some of these

520
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:40,790
interactions are sending the long-wave

521
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,560
radiation in various random directions

522
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,430
I'm just going to draw a few of them

523
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,430
because it takes forever

524
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,660
so well I'm trying to draw here is that

525
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,950
there's all these interactions occurring

526
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:59,160
with greenhouse gases now eventually

527
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:01,500
this long wave radiation will make it

528
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,960
out to space right you know it'll bounce

529
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,120
back and forth between one molecule and

530
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,480
what have you eventually it'll get out

531
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:17,060
but before it gets out the person on the

532
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:19,860
ground down here is experiencing these

533
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:24,120
photons a long wave radiation coming

534
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:26,100
back down out of the sky now before we

535
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,420
say they're coming down reflecting off a

536
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,970
cloud well in this case we have no

537
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,830
clouds but they're still coming back

538
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,700
down they're reflecting off of these

539
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,100
invisible gases these greenhouse gases

540
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,680
so if this one for example comes down to

541
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,890
the ground and hits this person this

542
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,240
person feels warmer well eventually if

543
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,720
we just think about where that

544
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,150
ultimately goes it'll eventually head

545
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,790
back out into space and it may reflect

546
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,470
back and forth several times but it'll

547
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:58,380
eventually get out it'll eventually go

548
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,180
out into into space but you can think of

549
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,310
this as like we're recycling some of

550
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,470
these long these parties photons of long

551
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:06,780
wave radiation it was all headed to

552
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,380
space it got intercepted on the way

553
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,660
there

554
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,600
got rerouted back down towards the

555
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,970
surface some of it and then as it hits

556
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,490
the surface that it's back headed back

557
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:21,030
out to space for a second or third or

558
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:23,220
fourth or fifth time so this is what we

559
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,980
mean by greenhouse effect the greenhouse

560
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,170
effect means we have these molecules

561
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,060
that has has this property of being able

562
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,400
to absorb

563
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,920
Longway radiation redirect it in a

564
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,350
random direction that random direction

565
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,840
could be back down towards the surface

566
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:43,010
in which case it makes the surface

567
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,350
warmer than initially was going to be

568
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:49,880
that's the greenhouse effect and because

569
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:53,660
of the greenhouse effect the worldwide

570
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,660
average temperature

571
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:03,250
is about 54 degrees okay

572
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:07,350
and that's lucky for us because that's

573
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,670
above freezing so we could not survive

574
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:12,520
without the greenhouse effect

575
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,440
so prior we said that without the

576
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,320
greenhouse effect the entire earth is

577
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,200
below freezing okay we have to have the

578
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,140
rehouse effect to survive on this planet

579
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,750
it just turns out that in the last 100

580
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,200
ish years or so we as humans have been

581
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,780
adding too much of a good thing to the

582
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,600
planet and into the atmosphere and we

583
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,580
are increasing this greenhouse effect so

584
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,310
as we get into climate change what what

585
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,110
I want you to keep clear is you got to

586
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:44,260
have the greenhouse effect you got to

587
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,180
have it otherwise we die right but we've

588
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,520
got it a little too much of it now and

589
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,970
so things are warming up because we are

590
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,530
reflecting more of those long wave

591
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,980
photons back towards the surface that

592
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:58,810
are that are supposed to be here okay

593
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,480
we're going to return to that Phet

594
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,640
animation and we were looking at this

595
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,650
tab called photon absorption and now

596
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,320
we're going to go over to greenhouse

597
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,850
effect and what they're trying to show

598
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,910
they're trying to animate basically what

599
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:15,100
we just drew they're using yellow to

600
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,810
represent shortwave radiation from the

601
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,750
Sun so these little yellow photons

602
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:22,120
that's the visible light plus the UV

603
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:25,780
maybe some near-infrared coming down and

604
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,230
this the red represents the long wave

605
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,330
radiation going back out into space okay

606
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,520
so this is what we drew as arrows I used

607
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,870
the color blue they're using the color

608
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,260
yellow

609
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:41,350
but there's photons coming down there's

610
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:44,550
photons going out no greenhouse gases

611
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:47,050
and it shows that the worldwide

612
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:49,300
temperature is about in this case looks

613
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,070
like it's about minus 2 pretty close to

614
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,760
zero zero degrees Fahrenheit right so

615
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:57,400
the world is frozen now what I can do

616
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,180
with this is I can put in greenhouse

617
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,670
gases and watch how things change so

618
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,040
right now this entire time I've had this

619
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,850
says greenhouse gas concentration have

620
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,280
had it all

621
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:13,270
and I'm gonna turn it up to somewhere in

622
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:16,300
the middle here and what I want you to

623
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,190
do is notice how the red ones change

624
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,540
their behavior you'll notice if you

625
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,570
watch one for a while it'll suddenly

626
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,220
change direction that's where it's

627
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,980
interacting with a greenhouse gas

628
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,400
molecule and kind of like I drew with

629
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:33,100
arrows reflecting these little photons

630
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,290
of long-wave radiation are headed out to

631
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,690
space but before they get there they

632
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,550
often get intercepted redirected and a

633
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,040
lot of them come back down towards the

634
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:43,510
surface so what that means is the

635
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,920
surface is getting warm and you can see

636
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:48,550
the temperature has been rising here

637
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,020
okay so this is the greenhouse effect

638
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,630
and they're not showing you the

639
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:55,750
molecules I drew those in on our last

640
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:59,070
paper but it's showing it's animating

641
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:04,000
the effect that the greenhouse effect

642
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:05,680
produces I could also just turn it all

643
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,230
the way up so I'm going to crank it all

644
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,250
that we have greenhouse gas

645
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,500
concentrations all the way Taurus has

646
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,960
lots and you'll see a lot more

647
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,120
interactions with the red maliki the red

648
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,740
photons you see a lot of them bouncing

649
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,960
around meaning that they're interacting

650
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,940
with greenhouse gas molecules coming

651
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,520
back towards the surface and we see that

652
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,080
that surface temperature is now

653
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,420
increasing looks like it's getting up to

654
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,790
over 70 degrees now remember what this

655
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,840
means this is not 70 degrees I mean that

656
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,450
doesn't sound bad at all

657
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,790
that's a worldwide global average so

658
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,620
it's also including the poles and the

659
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:43,030
days and nights and the winners and

660
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:46,420
everything right so worldwide the entire

661
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:50,200
temperature is increasing if I increase

662
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,340
the greenhouse gas concentrations so

663
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,380
we're going to talk about some of these

664
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,000
different greenhouse gases but before we

665
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,940
do that we're going to talk a little bit

666
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,410
about some of the gases we've talked

667
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:05,140
about so far in class and so early on in

668
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,570
the semester we talked about how the

669
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,630
atmosphere is mostly oxygen and nitrogen

670
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:13,570
a little bit of argon a little bit co2 a

671
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,970
little bit of water vapor and then up in

672
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:17,710
the stratosphere a little bit of ozone

673
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,980
right so these are all naturally

674
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,230
occurring

675
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:24,040
and we did a section on air pollution we

676
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,040
talked about gases some of these are

677
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,599
human created some of these are

678
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,300
naturally occurring but humans add to

679
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,089
that so things like carbon monoxide so2

680
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,010
NOx and all those things so that was

681
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:40,099
part of our air pollution unit okay so

682
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,619
now we have a third category gases that

683
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:44,869
we're calling greenhouse gases okay and

684
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:49,070
all of the greenhouse gases we can

685
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:51,919
subdivide them into two categories one

686
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:55,250
is naturally-occurring greenhouse gases

687
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,139
that we as humans are adding to and then

688
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,270
there's a second category of greenhouse

689
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,400
gases that we as humans have just

690
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,089
created there are synthetic molecules

691
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,990
okay

692
00:35:02,089 --> 00:35:10,460
so before we get to further in on this

693
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:13,790
we're going to really be focusing on

694
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:16,250
this group right here co2 ch4 and n2 oh

695
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:19,609
and we're not going to really talk about

696
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:22,220
water vapor even though water vapor is

697
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:24,319
the most abundant greenhouse gas in the

698
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,750
atmosphere so why would we not talk

699
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:28,940
about this well if you go back to when

700
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,260
we talked about humidity we said that

701
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,720
the amount of water vapor in the

702
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:35,060
atmosphere is controlled strongly by

703
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,089
temperature so warm air has a higher

704
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:40,160
possible maximum mixing ratio right and

705
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:42,079
if they cool the air down remember we

706
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,670
hit the dew point we condense water out

707
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,560
so what water vapor cannot stay in the

708
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:52,069
atmosphere if the atmosphere is too cold

709
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,109
right so if we all as humans got

710
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:56,829
together and started adding water vapor

711
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:59,480
to the atmosphere on purpose let's say

712
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:01,910
it won't stay in the atmosphere more

713
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,400
than maybe a few days before it drifts

714
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,660
off into someplace cold condenses out

715
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,819
and it gets removed from the atmosphere

716
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,589
the greenhouse gases that we're

717
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:12,349
interested in are the ones that are not

718
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:14,300
being removed in a short time okay so

719
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:16,400
that's why we're not really talking

720
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,230
about water vapor even though water

721
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,510
vapor is a pretty significant greenhouse

722
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:25,700
gas okay so so it turns out the

723
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:28,970
strengths of greenhouse gases are not

724
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,010
all the same and if you think back to

725
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,010
the animation we're shooting molecules

726
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,779
with the little gun

727
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,609
you know occasionally molecule got

728
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:39,680
excited and absorbed that photon of

729
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:44,150
radiation and then re-emitted it okay

730
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,460
well some molecules absorb radiation

731
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,619
much easier than others they are much

732
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,380
more efficient at being greenhouse gases

733
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:55,220
and so we have this system called global

734
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,890
warming potential or GWP and what we say

735
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,230
is that greenhouse gasses so on the Left

736
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,520
these are all greenhouse gases and by

737
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,760
the way if you're one of my students

738
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,260
what I'm showing you here are part of

739
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,089
what we used to have handouts and my

740
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,549
face-to-face class so this is on learn

741
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:14,420
so you can find this document in some of

742
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:17,750
the future slides too so what we say is

743
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:23,750
that co2 has a GWP of one okay we just

744
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:28,420
aren't this arbitrary so methane ch4 has

745
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:32,270
a GWP of 25 so what that means is ch4

746
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:35,900
per molecule is 25 times as powerful of

747
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:39,109
a greenhouse gas as co2 so if I had one

748
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:42,589
molecule of ch4 it's worth twenty-five

749
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:45,829
molecules of co2 or if I take nitrous

750
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:48,740
oxide n2o it has a global warming

751
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:52,579
potential 298 so one molecule of nitrous

752
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:54,440
oxide is worth 298 molecules of co2 so

753
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:57,079
greenhouse gases all have very different

754
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,450
strengths and what we want to do here is

755
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,609
we want to be able to compare different

756
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,960
sources to see which emissions are

757
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:09,349
actually affecting the greenhouse effect

758
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:12,920
more and so if I go back a slide these

759
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:15,410
were the naturally occurring ones and we

760
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,619
as humans add them that's these three

761
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,970
and then all these are synthetic we as

762
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:23,059
humans make them they don't occur in

763
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:26,779
nature notice though how strong some of

764
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:30,410
these are this one has a GWP 14800 so

765
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:34,670
one single molecule of HFC 23 is worth

766
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:36,849
about 15,000 co2 molecules also notice

767
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:39,319
that they are up in the atmosphere

768
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:42,559
sometimes for a very long time and we

769
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:45,710
look at this see CF 4 has an atmospheric

770
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:47,180
lifetime of 50,000 years meaning that

771
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,010
it gets in the atmosphere there's no

772
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,080
natural processes that break this down

773
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:55,099
it's gonna be up there a very very long

774
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:57,470
time okay so what we want to do is let's

775
00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:00,980
imagine a scenario we we've got three

776
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:03,109
different greenhouse gas emitters I'd

777
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,700
say three different factories but

778
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:07,430
they're not all emitting the same gas

779
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,470
you've got one emitting co2 you get one

780
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,349
emitting methane you get one mini

781
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:14,630
nitrous oxide and you want to know who's

782
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:17,420
actually making the biggest contribution

783
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,550
to the greenhouse effect so in order to

784
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,770
do this we have to convert all those

785
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:25,580
gasses to what we're gonna call co2

786
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:28,730
equivalent the analogy is like money if

787
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,650
I if I had something in dollars so I

788
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,089
have enough some item and that's worth a

789
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,530
certain amount of dollars I have another

790
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:35,720
item that's worth a certain amount of

791
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:38,210
pesos I got a third item that's worth

792
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,320
certain the number of euros and my

793
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,290
question is which one is the most

794
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,780
expensive I won't know till I convert

795
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,880
them all to the same currency what we're

796
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:50,150
doing here is we're going to convert all

797
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,040
the gases to the same currency of co2

798
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,990
and we're going to use a global warming

799
00:39:52,040 --> 00:40:02,260
potential to do this okay I'm gonna work

800
00:39:53,990 --> 00:40:09,280
through a problem so let's say we have a

801
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:13,390
cement plant and the cement plant is

802
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:21,430
emitting 1,200 kilograms of co2 per day

803
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:23,690
okay and then we have a gas plant that

804
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,740
processes natural gas we'll talk more

805
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:33,470
about this later and it is it is

806
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:38,830
emitting 150 kilograms of methane per

807
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,830
day okay then we have a fertilizer plant

808
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:51,910
and let's say it is emitting 25

809
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:52,270
kilograms of nitrous oxide per day all

810
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,250
right

811
00:40:52,270 --> 00:41:03,060
so the question is if this is the

812
00:40:54,250 --> 00:41:03,060
scenario where we focus here then I

813
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:10,170
compare these three who is contributing

814
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:25,930
the most to the greenhouse effect okay

815
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,300
so what we said a few minutes ago is

816
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:30,100
that we need the greenhouse effect to

817
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,530
survive on the planet but as humans

818
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,330
we're adding more to it here we have

819
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,400
three different outfits that are

820
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:39,580
emitting greenhouse gases but what we

821
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,110
want to know is who's adding the most ok

822
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,900
who's who's making the biggest

823
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:47,200
contribution to to the greenhouse effect

824
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,880
through greenhouse gas emissions so in

825
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,080
order to do this we're going to convert

826
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,080
everything to co2

827
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,340
now cement plant it's already n co2 so

828
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,120
I'd have to do anything ok

829
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:07,390
no work ok that's done so what I do have

830
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,120
to do is take the gas plant and I want

831
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:14,560
to convert I want to say ok if it if it

832
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:17,590
is emitting 150 kilograms of ch4 what is

833
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,710
the equivalent amount of co2 that that

834
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:27,600
would be or converting currency here ok

835
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:30,130
so I'm going to take 150 this is ch4 and

836
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,560
what I'm going to do is multiply that

837
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:35,080
number times the global warming

838
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,130
potential so the global warming

839
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:42,820
potential of methane ch4 is 25 1

840
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:46,750
molecule of ch4 is worth 25 co2 s all

841
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:55,150
right so I multiply that by 25 okay so

842
00:42:46,750 --> 00:43:05,450
I'm gonna take $150 25 I get 3000

843
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:10,190
750 kilograms of co2 equivalent okay so

844
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:11,900
I so that 150 kilograms of ch4 is the

845
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,090
same amount of global warming potential

846
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,750
as three thousand seven hundred fifty

847
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:24,500
kilograms of co2 all right let's do the

848
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:29,750
fertilizer plant so I've got 25

849
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:36,310
kilograms of n2o nitrous oxide and I

850
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:45,380
look up the goe P of n 2o it's 298 so

851
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:47,000
multiply by 298 25 times 298 I get seven

852
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:54,430
thousand four hundred and fifty

853
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:57,320
kilograms a co2 equivalent okay

854
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,750
sometimes we get really tired of writing

855
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:05,300
out the word equivalent so what you'll

856
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:07,720
see instead is co2 eq and sometimes in

857
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,430
parentheses that means equivalent co2

858
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:15,290
alright so we've converted currency's

859
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:19,600
our cement plant is twelve hundred

860
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:21,860
kilograms of co2 our gas plant is

861
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,500
equivalent to three thousand seven

862
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,690
hundred fifty kilograms of co2 and a

863
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,180
fertilizer plant is equivalent to seven

864
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:32,150
thousand four hundred and fifty

865
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,550
kilograms of co2 so who's making the

866
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,970
biggest contribution fertilizer plant

867
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:41,770
okay so even though it was the smallest

868
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:44,930
overall amount in terms of mass of gases

869
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:47,600
these nitrous oxide gives such a potent

870
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:49,160
greenhouse effect overall when you

871
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,170
multiply the whole thing out times the

872
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,580
global warming potential you find out

873
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,650
that it actually makes the biggest

874
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,940
contribution so if you're one of my

875
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,010
students you'll have a couple of these

876
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,970
problems you'll have to work out this

877
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:03,740
week okay so here's a breakdown of the

878
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:06,020
major greenhouse gases that are emitted

879
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,390
in the United States and they've been

880
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:12,170
converted to co2

881
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:15,650
so it says percentages based on MMT

882
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:17,599
million mega ton that's just a gigantic

883
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:22,400
number don't worry too much about that

884
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:25,430
co2 equivalent okay so what this is

885
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,740
showing is that 82% of all the

886
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:31,309
greenhouse gas emissions that we produce

887
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:34,819
in the United States is co2 okay and if

888
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:37,579
you convert the other ones to co2

889
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:39,319
equivalent so there's methane and

890
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:40,789
there's not just oxide and then here's a

891
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,309
whole bunch of it yeah of the other ones

892
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:47,210
what you see is that even though these

893
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:50,690
are a stronger greenhouse gas as a

894
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:52,670
nation we emit co2 by such a greater

895
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,069
volume that this is the greenhouse gas

896
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:58,339
that we typically focus on we're talking

897
00:45:55,069 --> 00:46:00,349
about global warming issues the co2 is

898
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:02,450
the number-one gas that we're worried

899
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:04,670
about that doesn't mean we don't worry

900
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:08,089
about these others we do because they do

901
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:11,200
have a greenhouse effect but co2 is by

902
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:13,250
far the biggest one that we worry about

903
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,390
so here's another way to look at those

904
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:21,380
same numbers over time so the blue is

905
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:23,750
how much co2 we've emitted each year

906
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,150
then the red is the methane Green is

907
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,349
nitrous oxide and then purple has served

908
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,690
a whole bunch of other ones all thrown

909
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:31,400
together as time has gone on you'll see

910
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:35,150
there's kind of this overall trend from

911
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,579
early 1990 early 1990s to the mid 2000s

912
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:40,339
where every year as a country we're

913
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:42,680
emitting more and more greenhouse gases

914
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,910
and again these are and you can't really

915
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,210
even wrap your mouth around these

916
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:50,569
numbers so this is 7,000 million

917
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,700
megatons so you have to basically add 12

918
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:54,289
zeros onto the ends of these numbers but

919
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,109
don't worry about that it's just a

920
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:59,450
meaningless gigantic number to you

921
00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,670
notice what happens here 2008 things go

922
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,309
downhill a little bit so the world

923
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:06,170
economy slowed down we stopped buying

924
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:08,329
things we stopped building things we

925
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,160
stopped burning so much fuel and we see

926
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:12,500
that there's a little drop-off here but

927
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,720
as years go by you can see that the

928
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:19,309
trends are pretty similar right that as

929
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,259
a nation we tend to emit mostly co2 and

930
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:22,480
then methane and nitrous oxide is our

931
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:25,760
greenhouse gases

932
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,500
so we're gonna talk about what we do to

933
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,779
generate some of these greenhouse gases

934
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,760
so again you this is part of the figures

935
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:34,539
that are on this handout that I've got

936
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,549
on learn if you're in my class so

937
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:42,740
sources of co2 emissions again in this

938
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:46,579
million Megaton co2 equivalent okay

939
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:48,230
fossil fuel combustion now before I talk

940
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:50,630
about that look at some of the ones

941
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:52,700
below here non energy use of fuels iron

942
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,799
and steel production natural gas systems

943
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,589
cement production and down here on the

944
00:47:54,799 --> 00:48:03,740
x-axis are numbers in this million

945
00:47:57,589 --> 00:48:07,700
Megaton co2 so 25 50 75 but this very

946
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:10,760
first one is so long it would be off the

947
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:13,730
page on through next several pages and

948
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,690
it would end over here at five thousand

949
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,760
so what they did is they put a little

950
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,670
dash right here to show that this is not

951
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:23,180
continuous that the rest of these bars

952
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:26,180
you know this is 150 that's the scale so

953
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:29,000
this moves on for you know a dozen pages

954
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:33,049
later if this was all to scale okay so

955
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,359
that number right there that 5050 that

956
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:37,520
is a so much larger number than all of

957
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:40,250
these so what this is saying is that the

958
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,109
number one source of co2 is burning

959
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:46,309
fossil fuels that's the number one thing

960
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:48,950
we do more than anything else then we've

961
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:50,210
got some of these other things you

962
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,980
probably have heard at least heard about

963
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:54,980
some of these things so when we make

964
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:59,270
cement that adds co2 to the air when we

965
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:02,690
make RN steel add co2 to the air all

966
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:04,730
these things add some co2 to the air but

967
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:08,210
that very first one that fossil fuel

968
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:11,630
combustion boy that is by large by far

969
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:13,970
the number one thing that we do so in

970
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:17,329
this table we are breaking down the co2

971
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:21,770
further so we said that this number

972
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:24,950
right here this 5050 is so five thousand

973
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:28,099
50 million megatons of co2 were produced

974
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,569
in 2015 in the United States for burning

975
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:31,970
fossil fuels yeah that's what that

976
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:34,940
there's that number we can break that

977
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,130
down further all of that five thousand

978
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,160
50 million

979
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:40,830
megatonnes 1900 was for generating

980
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:45,820
electricity

981
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:50,410
17:36 was for transportation 805 was for

982
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:53,470
residential or I'm sorry industrial 319

983
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:56,050
was for residential now reason I'm

984
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:58,270
bringing this up is that most people

985
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:01,030
don't realize that when we talk about

986
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:04,000
burning fossil fuels ok we're generating

987
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:06,400
co2 from burning fossil fuels the number

988
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,120
one thing we burn fossil fuels to do in

989
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:14,200
this country is not to drive cars the

990
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:18,790
number one thing is this one generating

991
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:20,860
electricity so we produced more co2 from

992
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:23,800
generating electricity by burning fossil

993
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:28,330
fuels then we do say burning fossil

994
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:31,150
fuels in our cars cars ships everything

995
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:33,340
airplanes etc that's transportation

996
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,900
that's number two so number one

997
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:37,600
generating electricity

998
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:43,030
number two transportation and then it

999
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:46,240
breaks down further from there when we

1000
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:48,550
get to methane the number one source of

1001
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,080
methane in this country is something

1002
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:53,170
called enteric fermentation

1003
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:56,020
what does enteric fermentation fancy way

1004
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:58,270
of saying cow farts so cows they eat

1005
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,570
grass grass goes down they got this

1006
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:03,310
weird for stomach system and so you

1007
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,080
heard about cows chewing their cud right

1008
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,180
so they they chewed this grass that goes

1009
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,320
down and eventually they comes back up

1010
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,000
and they chew for a while and it goes

1011
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,340
back down there's bacteria down there

1012
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,170
and the bacteria produced methane and

1013
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,580
methane some come sometimes comes out

1014
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,520
the front end sometimes comes up the

1015
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:21,280
back end of the cow but cows produce a

1016
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,140
lot of methane as a country we really

1017
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,510
like our hamburgers so we have a lot of

1018
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,970
cows and cows produce a lot of methane

1019
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,590
that's enteric fermentation that's the

1020
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:32,560
number one source of methane in our

1021
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:33,610
country number two is natural gas so

1022
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,260
we're going to talk about this in a

1023
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:37,840
future lecture but when we extract

1024
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,460
natural gas out of the ground some of it

1025
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,010
gets into the atmosphere

1026
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,270
number three is landfills so this is

1027
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,380
where all your garbage goes they just

1028
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:47,500
throw in a big hole in the ground and

1029
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,630
cover it bacteria decay that that the

1030
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,360
garbage

1031
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:54,300
then that produces methane manure

1032
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,760
management might be a career option if

1033
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,010
if college isn't working out for you

1034
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,660
coal mining petroleum systems wastewater

1035
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:03,060
treatment that's where all your sewer

1036
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,860
goes methane is produced through that so

1037
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:07,470
there's a bunch of them here and here's

1038
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:09,660
a breakdown of nitrous oxide and number

1039
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:11,760
one on the list is agricultural soil

1040
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,530
management so this is another one of

1041
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,540
those graphs that they have the break

1042
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:19,080
because it's so bigger so much bigger

1043
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,780
than all the other ones so number one by

1044
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,160
far is agricultural soil manager what

1045
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,320
does that mean so plants need nitrogen

1046
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,330
but they can't take nitrogen out of the

1047
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,310
air they have to take it out of the soil

1048
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:31,350
but there's a limited amount of nitrogen

1049
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:33,960
in the soil so what humans have done is

1050
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:37,410
they figured out how to add nitrogen to

1051
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,900
the soil making we make something called

1052
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,520
synthetic fertilizer and they look like

1053
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,610
these little babies you throw them into

1054
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,230
the soil and they break down and they

1055
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:48,330
produce nitrogen that the plants can

1056
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,460
absorb well one of the byproducts of

1057
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:51,990
that is some of that produces nitrous

1058
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,820
oxide which then goes into the

1059
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:56,790
atmosphere okay so that's your number

1060
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,680
one here by far number two stationary

1061
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,840
combustion that's something that's

1062
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,080
burning but not moving like it could be

1063
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,750
an engine that's not moving anywhere it

1064
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,970
could be a fire manure management again

1065
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:12,240
mobile combustion okay so now you got an

1066
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:15,090
engine that's on the move wastewater

1067
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,480
treatment again so on down the line so

1068
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:22,830
the number one though by far is

1069
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:26,280
agricultural soil management so if we

1070
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:29,340
think about all of the variety of

1071
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,080
sources that is the greenhouse gases

1072
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,300
were putting into the atmosphere and

1073
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,330
sinks these are things that remove

1074
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:39,240
greenhouse gases from the atmosphere it

1075
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:42,120
kind of looks like this so this is on

1076
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,490
the y axis it says million megatons of

1077
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,290
co2 equivalent right so we're taking all

1078
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,990
the different greenhouse gases

1079
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:51,540
converting all of them to co2 equivalent

1080
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:55,070
throwing it all together and looking at

1081
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:57,870
what we got is a country so the blue is

1082
00:53:55,070 --> 00:54:01,740
energy okay so most of the greenhouse

1083
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:04,250
gases are from this energy sector

1084
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:07,349
so that's electricity that's

1085
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:09,270
transportation energy is a lot of a lot

1086
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:12,510
of things there then the red is

1087
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:15,690
agriculture then the green is industrial

1088
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:18,450
processes of some kind this little blue

1089
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:20,819
here is waste so that's mostly us

1090
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:23,990
throwing things away and then this

1091
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:23,990
little tiny one

1092
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:29,490
it says L u L u CF which stands for a

1093
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:32,069
land-use line use change and forestry

1094
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:36,450
okay and we'll talk more about this in a

1095
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:39,809
little later lecture okay so as time has

1096
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:41,430
gone on as the economy has grown you can

1097
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,470
see overall the amount of greenhouse

1098
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,720
gases has gone up and up and up like we

1099
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,819
saw an earlier slide then the economy

1100
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:51,839
kind of crashes in 2008 and drops down

1101
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:53,220
again but by and large the the number

1102
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,609
one thing that we do as humans to

1103
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:59,069
produce greenhouse gases is generating

1104
00:54:56,609 --> 00:55:01,109
energy of some kind right either

1105
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:04,260
electricity or our cars or what have you

1106
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:06,480
also notice this purple which is

1107
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,730
negative okay this is what we call a

1108
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,940
sync so what that means is these are

1109
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:14,039
processes that take co2 or other

1110
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,170
greenhouse gases out of the air and

1111
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:18,930
remove them well what would that be so

1112
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:22,309
imagine a really intensive farming if

1113
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:26,309
you plant a lot of plants in a tiny area

1114
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:27,750
then they're going to pull down co2 out

1115
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:30,630
of the atmosphere and they'll actually

1116
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:32,279
offset some of the co2 that we've been

1117
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,630
putting into the atmosphere so that's

1118
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:36,079
what we mean is a sink that's this

1119
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,079
purple
