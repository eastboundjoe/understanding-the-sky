[Music]

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,950
hey this is Mel strong and this lecture

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,740
is on the carbon cycle and more about

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,330
greenhouse gases so this is a

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,490
continuation of the greenhouse gas

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,550
lecture so if you haven't watched that

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,070
watch that one first and one of the

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,349
things I'm going to be doing is talking

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,940
about how carbon moves around in

10
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,360
different reservoirs around the earth

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,820
and so I'm gonna use some illustrations

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,440
that I made that are on my website or on

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,260
the learn if you're one of my students

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,360
and I'm going to illustrate them feel

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,309
free to print yours out and illustrate

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,840
it the same way we talked about how last

17
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,449
time the last lecture that there are

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,039
several greenhouse gases there's a bunch

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,800
of greenhouse gases and some of them are

20
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,039
really strong but of all the ones that

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,080
we worry about co2 is the number one gas

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,229
that we're concerned about just because

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,220
as humans reproduce more co2 than

24
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,630
anything else by far okay and so we

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,659
worry about methane we worry about

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,360
nitrous oxide but we really worry about

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,490
carbon dioxide because we just invent so

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,600
much of it so that's what this lecture

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:29,340
is about it's a mostly about co2 and so

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:33,540
we talked about where the co2 is and in

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,320
the atmosphere it's in the form co2 but

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,840
it can actually that co2 molecule can

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,750
can move to different locations like

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,159
maybe the ocean or maybe in a plant and

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:50,790
it's no longer in the form of co2 it can

36
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,060
change to a different molecule so we

37
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,939
keep track of the carbon part of the co2

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,500
so we talked about the carbon cycle

39
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:00,979
ultimately what we're trying to get at

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,880
is that co2 is in the atmosphere and

41
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,500
something is putting it into the

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,149
atmosphere something is removing it from

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,429
the atmosphere and it's being stored

44
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,129
somewhere but it's not necessarily

45
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,740
always in the form of co2 it could be

46
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:17,640
some other carbon molecule

47
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,660
okay so to start out with we're going to

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:27,000
talk about something called the

49
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:29,700
reservoirs of carbon okay this is where

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,670
the carbon is okay where is it being

51
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:37,830
stored around Earth and I'm going to use

52
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:40,350
a unit here called the teragrams and we

53
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:45,420
abbreviate it as TG oops

54
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:50,220
okay a teragrams one teragrams is one

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,900
times ten to the twelfth grams and what

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,630
that would mean is you'd have to move

57
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,810
the decimal over twelve places so for

58
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,180
example if I had three teragrams that's

59
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,750
the same thing as three times ten to the

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,500
twelve grams which is the same thing as

61
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:11,840
three one two three four five six seven

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:15,330
eight nine ten eleven twelve zeros right

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,150
put some commas in there and the thing

64
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,460
is this is such a giant number like you

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,620
can't really wrap your mind around what

66
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,450
that even means and it doesn't matter

67
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,580
because the point of doing this is to

68
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,250
show relative sizes of which cart which

69
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,480
reservoirs are bigger and smaller but

70
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,400
they're going to be in this unit of

71
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,620
teragrams so for the numbers we're going

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,270
to write down remember just add twelve

73
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,010
zeros to everything if you wanted to

74
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:43,110
write out the number okay so the carbon

75
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,390
we are concerned about is the carbon in

76
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,360
the atmosphere and it's in the form of

77
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:57,660
co2 and that number is currently about

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:04:00,930
829 teragrams okay now by comparison if

79
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,730
you added up all the carbon of all of

80
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,830
the plants in the world

81
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:10,890
you get about 600 teragrams

82
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,080
okay so these are if you look these

83
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,640
numbers up you'll get slight variations

84
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,520
on this so these are kind of mutually

85
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,310
agreed-upon numbers more or less right

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,919
okay then in the soil because soil

87
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,790
there's a lot of living and dead organic

88
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,980
material in the soil and that

89
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:33,690
a lot of carbon in it soil is about

90
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:37,650
2,000 teragrams okay now the ocean

91
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,080
there's a lot of carbon in the ocean and

92
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:50,860
it can be in a couple forms it could be

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:53,010
in the form of dissolved gases so what

94
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,590
that means is anytime you have gas

95
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,020
sitting above liquid there is exchange

96
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,630
between the two so there's co2 dissolved

97
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,150
in the ocean just like co2 is dissolved

98
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,580
say in a soda okay so some of it is in

99
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:10,210
the form of that some of it is in the

100
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,840
form of organic matter so in other words

101
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:18,190
anything living in the ocean so dead or

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,020
alive it's got carbon in it okay so add

103
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:25,000
it all up you get about thirty eight

104
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,740
thousand tera grams of carbon in the

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,470
ocean now notice so far that that

106
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,420
reservoir is so much bigger than

107
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,030
anything else we've written up here okay

108
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:39,070
that's just gigantic okay so there's a

109
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:42,490
lot of carbon in the ocean now this

110
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,860
diagram I have I made here shows

111
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,860
carbonate rocks down here what does

112
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:51,310
carbonate rocks carbonate a lot of times

113
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:55,450
we have this compound called calcium

114
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:58,750
carbonate and a lot of organisms have

115
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,360
this in their shell so if you find a sea

116
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,010
shell a clam shell for example it's

117
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,170
going to be some version of calcium

118
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,780
carbonate and there's that carbon that's

119
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,790
in this molecule well when that animal

120
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:13,030
dies sinks to the bottom of the ocean

121
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:16,030
gets buried that carbon is now buried in

122
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,400
this what we call carbonate rocks a lot

123
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,350
of it is microscopic organisms that you

124
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,360
actually can't see these are little

125
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,310
microscopic plankton that foot in the

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,900
ocean they have calcium carbonate

127
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,790
skeletons even though they're

128
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,680
single-celled microscopic organisms and

129
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,740
they they die they settle at the bottom

130
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,110
they make this this carbonate mud that

131
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,750
gets buried and so a lot of carbon ends

132
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,139
up getting buried in these carbonate

133
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,460
rock

134
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,680
now here's the kind of the confusing

135
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,199
thing is that a lot of these carbonate

136
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,300
rocks are no longer in the ocean because

137
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,860
they're spread all over the planet on

138
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,289
different continents where the ocean

139
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,849
used to be so we don't have time to go

140
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:55,120
through the geologic history of all this

141
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:56,560
but there are many times in geologic

142
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,659
history where for example the United

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,340
States was covered in a shallow sea and

144
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:05,319
so we have lots of carbonate rocks all

145
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,840
over the country all over the world that

146
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,669
are not in the ocean anymore even though

147
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,009
they used to be in the ocean so if you

148
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,449
live around Albuquerque you look up at

149
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,520
the Sandia's you see these little

150
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,370
horizontal stripes at the top those are

151
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,169
carbonate rocks those used to be at the

152
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,840
bottom of the ocean the ocean wasn't up

153
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:26,800
there those rocks were down below sea

154
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,479
level at one point okay add up all the

155
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,419
carbon and all the carbonate rocks in

156
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:38,889
the world and you get a pretty gigantic

157
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:42,849
number about 80 million teragrams okay

158
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:46,389
so so that number Dwarfs the one we just

159
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,400
wrote so most of the carbon in the world

160
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,800
is tied up in these rocks which again

161
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,080
started out in the ocean but they may no

162
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,339
longer be there and then the number two

163
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:02,139
reservoir is carbon in the ocean itself

164
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:04,990
now we also have in my picture here we

165
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:08,289
get fossil fuels right and so we can

166
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:18,990
break that up into let's see here we got

167
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:25,060
coal it's about 3500 oil about 230

168
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:29,589
natural gas about 140 and other forms of

169
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:32,979
fossil fuels about 250 and you add this

170
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:38,320
all up and you end up with greater than

171
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:41,079
about 4100 teragrams okay so let's

172
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,519
compare these numbers by far biggest you

173
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,199
know by far by far our biggest in the

174
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,060
rocks but let's just leave those aside

175
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:49,060
for the moment because that carbon is

176
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,020
pretty much stuck there the carbon in

177
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,690
the ocean is the biggest reservoir by

178
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,490
are the carbon in the atmosphere is the

179
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,190
one we worry about the most because this

180
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,850
is related to the greenhouse effect

181
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:05,220
notice how much carbon there is stored

182
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,810
up in fossil fuels compared to the

183
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,630
amount that's already in the atmosphere

184
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,150
right so there's way more waiting

185
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:16,160
underground that we as humans could

186
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:18,630
potentially burn and use and turn into

187
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,670
the atmosphere right turn into

188
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:26,430
atmospheric carbon okay so this is sort

189
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,610
of a simplified look at the reservoirs

190
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,680
where the carbon actually is I'm going

191
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,170
to start with another diagram just like

192
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,440
this and we're going to talk about

193
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:40,620
processes that are going going on here

194
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:46,080
okay so for this next diagram we're

195
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,670
going to do something about fluxes okay

196
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,060
and a fox

197
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:57,650
in this case fox is something that's in

198
00:09:51,060 --> 00:10:03,960
motion foxes in this case is carbon

199
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:07,140
moving between reservoirs okay so the

200
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,970
last one was reservoirs where is the

201
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,340
carbon being stored now we're looking at

202
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,690
how is the carbon being moved back and

203
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,150
forth between some of these reservoirs

204
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:20,340
and that's off what a fox is okay so

205
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:25,280
we'll start with some that you probably

206
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:30,330
already know so you learn for example

207
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:36,480
back in your days in biology about

208
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:39,090
photosynthesis okay

209
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,300
so the general formula for

210
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:45,390
photosynthesis the general reaction is

211
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:50,280
plants take co2 and they take water and

212
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:53,280
they take light and they produce glucose

213
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:57,090
and oxygen right this is what

214
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,100
photosynthesis is all about this glucose

215
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,170
molecule if I were to if I were to write

216
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,710
this out and balance it the way that a

217
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,820
chemist would like I would have six co

218
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:18,210
twos

219
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:20,850
six waters and then I have this glucose

220
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,660
molecule six oxygens okay so the six is

221
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:28,380
just that's just to balance it when we

222
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,180
talk about the carbon cycle I said

223
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,910
earlier that we're following carbon

224
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,190
around and we're worried about co2 in

225
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,070
the atmosphere but it can change its

226
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,750
form and be in other molecules other

227
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,200
than co2 so here's an example what I

228
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:47,310
mean by that the carbon was in the

229
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:52,800
atmosphere as co2 okay and then the

230
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:56,550
plant puts it into plants tough plant

231
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,920
matter glucose our carbon just changed

232
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,920
reservoirs it went from the atmosphere

233
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:10,380
to the plant right so that's a flux

234
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,450
we're taking out of the atmosphere we're

235
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:18,240
putting it into some biomass okay so as

236
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:21,510
long as a plant is photosynthesizing

237
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,060
during the day it's removing co2 out of

238
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:31,830
the atmosphere okay so what I'm going to

239
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:34,650
do is draw these fluxes and different

240
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,800
colors so vegetation I'm going to draw

241
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:40,950
with a green arrow and what's coming in

242
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:45,180
from photosynthesis is about a hundred

243
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:53,690
and twenty three tera grams per year

244
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:57,960
okay so this is photosynthesis okay now

245
00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:04,110
the plant continues to live when the Sun

246
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:07,980
is is is not up because plants like us

247
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:10,290
have to respire so even though they are

248
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,540
producing oxygen during the day and

249
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,240
they're using up so you know that point

250
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,920
co2 out of the atmosphere during the day

251
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,290
there's a secondary process that's going

252
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,690
on twenty-four hours a day and it

253
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,070
it only goes on it's the only process

254
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,509
that goes on during the night but the

255
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,940
punts are doing it 24 hours a day and

256
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:28,589
it's called respiration respiration is

257
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,889
what we would call breathing okay we're

258
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:33,990
breathing in oxygen for letting us co2

259
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:36,930
deaths respiration we do it animals do

260
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,130
it plants do it and and so if we write

261
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,370
out that formula for respiration it's

262
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:50,880
basically the opposite of what we just

263
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:59,910
wrote for photosynthesis okay so we

264
00:13:50,880 --> 00:14:04,050
would have the glucose plus oxygen we'll

265
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:07,529
get some heat out of this reaction some

266
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,319
co2 and some in some some water vapor

267
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:14,639
and and so now what's happening is the

268
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:17,730
carbon that is in the glucose is being

269
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,800
transferred back into the carbon that's

270
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,699
now in the air right so this is this was

271
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:27,260
in the plant this is in the air this is

272
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:31,410
in the air okay this is in the air right

273
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:34,079
so photosynthesis we take the carbon out

274
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,670
we put it into glucose respiration we

275
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,839
take the carbon out of the glucose we

276
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,620
put it back in the air it's basically

277
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:43,260
backwards now we're doing the same thing

278
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,360
even though we're not plants we are

279
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:50,310
still taking a carbon from glucose and

280
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,620
we are exhaling co2 all right okay so

281
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,459
but just to focus on plants for a second

282
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,260
so what that means is there is this for

283
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,120
the synthesis that's removing carbon

284
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:09,449
from the air but then there's

285
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:13,790
respiration that is putting it back so

286
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:18,089
this is plant respiration

287
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:21,269
okay so 50 teragrams is going back out

288
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:22,920
into the atmosphere so the net that

289
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,160
plants are doing here is there is

290
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,040
they're bringing in more carbon than

291
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,069
they are producing as long as the plant

292
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
is it's growing so this is a worldwide

293
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:37,230
average for all

294
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,740
the vegetation on earth okay okay

295
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:44,670
now speaking of respiration down here in

296
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,560
the soil there is a lot of things that

297
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,870
are living in the soil I mean have the

298
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,270
root systems are respiring you get

299
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,090
microorganisms that are respiring so

300
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:57,120
there's respiration going on in the soil

301
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:00,120
and that is contributing carbon to the

302
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:06,000
atmosphere as well so I'll use a purple

303
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:14,550
color here and that is about 70 point

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:19,250
for teragrams per year also so let me

305
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,250
just put down soil this is respiration

306
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:30,540
and fire so fire is the same reaction

307
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:34,200
this is also the same reaction for fire

308
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,670
except fire it happens faster but when

309
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,250
you're burning a plant you're taking the

310
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:41,430
carbon from the plant matter reacting

311
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,760
with oxygen getting co2 and water vapor

312
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:46,530
okay so respiration and fire is the same

313
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,170
reaction just respiration as slow fire

314
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,940
is really fast so if you take all of the

315
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,710
naturally-occurring respiration in the

316
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,110
soil and all the naturally occuring fire

317
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,210
you get about 70 point four teragrams

318
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,900
per year going out back into the

319
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,460
atmosphere well now you've got I've got

320
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,949
a little farmer here and I can't fire

321
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:10,230
and whatnot and this is to simulate what

322
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:15,060
humans do we call this a land-use right

323
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:17,819
so if we cut down trees we put up a

324
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:21,270
parking lot we build houses we make

325
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:23,579
roads we pile fields we burn things down

326
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:29,430
that's collectively called the land-use

327
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:30,870
okay and land-use there's actually we

328
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,940
could break it down further like if I'm

329
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,400
a farmer and I and that plant crops

330
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,790
those crops we'll pull down the co2 out

331
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,490
of the atmosphere but when I take

332
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,770
everything to an account so the planting

333
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,230
of things plus the burning of things

334
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:52,860
well you know all of that combined

335
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:57,630
it turns out that we add about 1.1 tera

336
00:17:52,860 --> 00:18:07,230
grams per year and this is called land

337
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:09,299
use okay land use all right we will come

338
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,820
back to this in a second let's talk

339
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:15,120
about the ocean so one of the things I

340
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,880
said about the ocean a minute ago is

341
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,790
that there is gases that are going both

342
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:27,960
directions in the ocean so you have

343
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:34,230
gases going into the ocean and you have

344
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:47,520
gases leaving the ocean so I'm gonna

345
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:50,280
call this gas exchange and so you have

346
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,270
the you have the experience that if you

347
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:57,150
take say a soda and you twist the top

348
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,799
and then see what two comes bubbling out

349
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,919
right that co2 is dissolved into the

350
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,600
liquid right so you can take gases and

351
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,880
you can dissolve them into liquids and

352
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,429
in or pour glass water

353
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,140
set it down come back the next day

354
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:12,540
you'll see little bubbles on the inside

355
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:16,500
right that's gas that is coming back out

356
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,299
of the liquid so this is happening with

357
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,130
the ocean there's gas going into the

358
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,880
ocean and there's gas coming back out of

359
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:29,790
the ocean and what's going into the

360
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:33,380
ocean is about 92.3 teragrams per year

361
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:39,059
and what's leaving the ocean is about 90

362
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:42,090
tera grams per year okay so there's a

363
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:44,640
little there's a little more going in

364
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:49,100
and there is coming back out and we'll

365
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:54,650
come back to that in a minute and then

366
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:57,960
finally we have our fossil fuels here as

367
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,850
we burn fossil fuels - like we said in

368
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,789
the last lecture mostly generate

369
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:09,600
electricity transportation we are adding

370
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:17,880
about 7.8 teragrams

371
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:22,100
per year okay all right so we talk about

372
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:26,640
sources and sinks what does that mean

373
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:29,490
sources is where we're adding co2 to the

374
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,470
atmosphere that's a source a sink means

375
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,590
we're taking it and we're putting it

376
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,799
away somewhere underground or in Iraq or

377
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:40,500
in a plant and that's a sink okay so

378
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:43,890
we've got sources and sinks all right

379
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,659
going each direction so if we and by the

380
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,520
way this is simplified there are there

381
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,789
are many other smaller ones I'm just

382
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,770
trying to paint the big picture here so

383
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:55,530
the next diagram is going to be what is

384
00:20:52,770 --> 00:21:01,669
the net result what is the net result of

385
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:05,429
all of this all right so for this one

386
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:09,750
we're looking at the result of the

387
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:12,090
previous previous diagram of fluxes so

388
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,510
if I take all those foxes the sources

389
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:18,870
and the sinks and I do the math and we

390
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:26,039
see where ultimately are the changes

391
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:31,230
occurring overall every year there's

392
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:35,250
about 2.6 tera grams of carbon going

393
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,470
into the world's vegetation okay so

394
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:41,100
every year that goes by we're adding

395
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:45,620
more carbon to the world's forests to

396
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:49,890
our farms anything that's growing okay

397
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:52,020
now if you remember from West's from so

398
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,390
just a minute ago we were looking at the

399
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,030
last diagram we had over here that there

400
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:02,270
was two arrows going up and down from

401
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:08,520
the ocean and the net is that there is

402
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:10,500
about 2.3 tera grams per year going into

403
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,330
the ocean all right so there's gas

404
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,380
exchange some goes that some goes into

405
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,000
the ocean some

406
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,440
out of the ocean but there's a little

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,350
more going in than there is coming out

408
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,220
and so the net is that 2.3 teragrams per

409
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:25,380
year are going into the ocean we'll talk

410
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:37,980
more about that in a second and then the

411
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:41,790
atmosphere is gaining about four tera

412
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:44,640
grams per year okay now this is the

413
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,830
number this is this is the thing that

414
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,140
we're worried about the most okay

415
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,220
we're worried about what is the effect

416
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,450
of these increasing co2 levels right and

417
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,740
that's what you've been reading about in

418
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,800
my class this is what we're going to

419
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:03,510
keep talking about but let's talk about

420
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:07,440
this one first what does it mean to keep

421
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:10,020
adding this much carbon into the into

422
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,360
the ocean every year all right what does

423
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:21,480
that do so one of the things that it

424
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:27,120
does is if I take carbon dioxide and I

425
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:34,320
react it with water I will get a

426
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:42,900
compound h2 co3 which goes by the name

427
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:45,210
of carbonic acid this is a weak acid co2

428
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,120
in the presence of water turns into a

429
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,730
weak acid if you had a really bubbly

430
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,040
soda and you're trying to drink it out

431
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,630
of a glass or something you may have had

432
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,160
the experience once in a while that your

433
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,690
eyes burn a little bit like when it's

434
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,790
super fizzy that's carbonic acid so

435
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,710
every year we're dumping 2.3 teragrams

436
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,960
remember that means times you add 12

437
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,110
zeros to the end of this is going into

438
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,110
the ocean and that co2 that goes into

439
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:17,250
the ocean you may have read in our

440
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:18,900
textbook that it's a good thing that the

441
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,580
ocean is taking up some of the co2

442
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,280
because that means there's less of it

443
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,080
for the atmosphere but it's a bad thing

444
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,600
because we're making the ocean more

445
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,030
acidic the oceans

446
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,390
or overtime or becoming more and more

447
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:36,690
acidic because of this now why is that a

448
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,510
problem so let me show you a couple

449
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,880
pictures so when you think of a coral

450
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,890
reef this is probably what you think of

451
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,140
it there in Showell

452
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,850
usually warm water a lot of very

453
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,220
colorful organisms and I want you to

454
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,980
notice that it's in pretty shallow water

455
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:56,130
here maybe a meter or two below the

456
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,900
ocean's surface and there's a lot of

457
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,930
different organisms that live on a coral

458
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,790
reef so we see we've got CNN CNN amis

459
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,950
here we've got starfish we got sea

460
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,530
urchins with all kinds of things but

461
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:10,470
they're all living on this big mound in

462
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,290
the background and the mound itself was

463
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,200
built by these little organisms called

464
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:19,530
corals and these look like plants but

465
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,070
they're actually colonies each one of

466
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:25,740
these has a bunch of little tiny

467
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:28,010
individuals living inside and the coral

468
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:33,050
is each one of these little animals and

469
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:35,490
they secrete a calcium carbonate shell

470
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,100
essentially that binds them all together

471
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,410
until like this giant apartment complex

472
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,410
and each one of these guys is an

473
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,090
individual so corals are related to

474
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,610
jellyfish they have these little steamed

475
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,350
tentacles they sit there they do this

476
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,380
waiting for something to flow into their

477
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,780
mouth there are pretty simplistic

478
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:58,110
organism but they're important because

479
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,690
this calcium carbonate a house that

480
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:03,000
they're making forms the basis for work

481
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,730
all those other organisms that you saw

482
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,110
earlier are going to live now

483
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:12,570
even though corals are animals they have

484
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,880
living inside their tentacles these

485
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:19,500
little single-cell photosynthetic

486
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,750
bacteria called zooxanthellae okay so

487
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,190
this is what they look like so there's

488
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,740
one of the tentacles of the coral and he

489
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,690
sees all the green spots each one of

490
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,730
those green spots is a single cell for

491
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,850
the synthetic organism that generally

492
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,740
cannot survive on its own outside of the

493
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,600
coral so this is kind of confusing

494
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,700
because the coral is an animal but

495
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,770
living inside the animal are these

496
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,200
little plant like things that are for

497
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,450
this in

498
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,540
and they're producing energy that the

499
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,240
coral itself is using okay so they have

500
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,910
this symbiotic relationship the nothing

501
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,650
is going to eat the zones in thely

502
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:57,070
because they're sitting inside the

503
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:59,020
stinging little tentacle here and the

504
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,270
coral itself gets some energy from them

505
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,610
in order for this to work the coral has

506
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,860
to be about a meter below the ocean

507
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,980
surface right so if the coral gets out

508
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,260
of the water - huh you have gets out of

509
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,380
the water that's not good the coral dies

510
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,240
if it the water is too deep there's not

511
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,190
enough for the synthesis that's also a

512
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,910
problem so they'd like to be about a

513
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,250
meter or so below the surface well when

514
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,110
a coral gets stressed for reasons that

515
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:30,310
not I don't think are totally understood

516
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:31,630
the the coral will reject all of those

517
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,210
zones and thely

518
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,170
and they turn white and this is called

519
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,470
coral bleaching

520
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:40,690
so this coral right now is stressed what

521
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,480
would stress it higher temperatures will

522
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,900
stress it or if the ocean becomes more

523
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,580
acidic that will stress it out and so as

524
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,220
we have been making the ocean more and

525
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,970
more acidic and warmer and certain in

526
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:57,760
some respects we're seeing more and more

527
00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:00,640
bleaching of corals and so in some

528
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,340
places we see this big extent of coral

529
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,490
bleaching now these these corals again

530
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,570
this is the first stage on their way out

531
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:13,480
so they will reject the zone cynth le if

532
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,880
conditions improve then they will come

533
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,200
back and things are okay if conditions

534
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,470
continue to deteriorate

535
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,360
then the corals will die okay so not all

536
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,580
these corals in these pictures are

537
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,890
necessarily dead yet

538
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:31,210
here's some before and after pictures of

539
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:34,210
corals that are now bleaching and we see

540
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,340
big chunks of coral reefs around the

541
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,380
world starting to do this this is the

542
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,070
bad sign it tells us that the oceans are

543
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,500
now becoming inhospitable for the corals

544
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,230
and the corals form the basis for these

545
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,630
coral reef ecosystems here's one that's

546
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:52,270
finally dead so this one has bleaching

547
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,500
and then conditions never got better and

548
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,330
the corals finally died

549
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:02,000
here and now they kind of turn this dark

550
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:04,640
color so when you see here if I go

551
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,500
forward here's an example where some

552
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,530
coral this is the coral is bleaching

553
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,470
just starting to happen you see a big we

554
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:15,230
Qing event here the following year and

555
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:21,980
then later the corals are all dead and

556
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:25,810
turning this dark color so that is one

557
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:28,910
of the reasons why we worried about the

558
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:31,820
amount of carbon going into the ocean

559
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:34,490
we're producing carbonic acid that isn't

560
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,890
is stressing out the corals the corals

561
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,690
form the basis for these coral reef

562
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,170
ecosystems so we're seeing these big

563
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:44,840
bleaching events so a hundred years ago

564
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:48,290
or so scientists thought that we might

565
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,930
be adding carbon to the atmosphere but

566
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:53,960
no one had actually measured it and so

567
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,640
people speculated that you know we think

568
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,650
today people talk about global warming

569
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,060
like is this new idea but you can find

570
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,860
scientific papers a hundred years ago

571
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,560
where they were speculating that this

572
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,390
could happen but we didn't really have

573
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,000
any good measurements of carbon dioxide

574
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:11,000
in the atmosphere so finally in the

575
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,590
1950s a guy by the name of Charles

576
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,360
Keeling decides that he's going to build

577
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,910
a machine that's gonna measure carbon

578
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,530
dioxide and he's gonna build a machine

579
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,300
that takes a measurement like every day

580
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,820
and we're gonna start monitoring

581
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,520
monitoring it over the long period and

582
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,040
see if it changes so in order to do this

583
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,410
he needed to find a spot that was away

584
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,330
from cities that was pretty you know

585
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,580
hopefully up in the atmosphere he wanted

586
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,250
to get them the most the cleanest air

587
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,140
sample he could and so he decides that

588
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,480
he's going to do this on the Big Island

589
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,470
of Hawaii and so Big Island of Hawaii

590
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,330
has two volcanoes manalo Mauna Kea

591
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:51,680
they're both over 11,000 feet tall and

592
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:53,450
so at that time there wasn't a road up

593
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,770
to the top Ernie no electricity or

594
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,570
anything like that this is a this is a

595
00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:00,770
pretty big project but what he managed

596
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:02,660
to do starting in 1957 is he built an

597
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,970
instrument and he put it on the top or

598
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:08,310
near the top of one of these volcanoes

599
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,010
mono Lola and here

600
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:12,750
picture what it looks like up there

601
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,430
you're actually above there's a cloud

602
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,320
layer that forms over the ocean this is

603
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,630
stratocumulus so we talked about earlier

604
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,020
in the semester you're above the strata

605
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:24,810
cumulus on most days and this is a sign

606
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:28,920
that's up there today so that's at

607
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:30,870
11,000 141 feet and right now there's a

608
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,000
lot of equipment up there but back then

609
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:37,110
this the very first thing that they were

610
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,100
measuring was co2 so he builds his

611
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,750
machine he turns it on in 1957 and he

612
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,580
lets it run and it runs a couple of

613
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:49,260
years and he looks at his data for a

614
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:52,650
couple of years and he finds that there

615
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,990
is this very odd pattern where the the

616
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,240
co2 goes up and then it goes back down

617
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,600
again up and back down again up and back

618
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:04,710
down again but as it's doing that there

619
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,970
is this very slow rise over time okay so

620
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,780
we're going to talk about this this

621
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:13,770
graph is called the Keeling curve there

622
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:16,320
is no Nobel Prize in meteorology or

623
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:19,680
climatology or environmental science or

624
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,720
earth science but if there was if there

625
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,840
was ever a Nobel Prize in this field

626
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,510
this graph would get it first okay it's

627
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,700
such an important graph it actually has

628
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,530
its own bronze plaque and I don't know

629
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,350
of any other graph that has its own

630
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,940
bronze plaque okay the Keeling curve so

631
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,340
we're gonna study the Keeling curve

632
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:42,030
because it is so fundamentally important

633
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:45,900
to environmental science and what we're

634
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:51,360
talking about here okay so we're gonna

635
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:58,080
have a look at the Keeling curve and on

636
00:32:51,360 --> 00:33:03,090
the axis on the x axis is time and on

637
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:06,210
the y axis is co2 now you'll see for

638
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,600
example on this one it says parts per

639
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,760
million

640
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,490
okay so there's not much co2 in the

641
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:19,150
atmosphere but we have a way of

642
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:24,970
expressing it so if I had three parts

643
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:28,970
per hundred okay we would call that

644
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:32,750
percent can we use this symbol right so

645
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:36,110
the math would be three over 100 okay

646
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,870
that's percent there's another symbol

647
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:41,470
that you probably not familiar with

648
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,390
where if you had three parts per

649
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:50,120
thousand

650
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:53,960
that's called per mil and it has two of

651
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:57,140
the circles and you would do it you do

652
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:06,290
three divided by thousand okay if I have

653
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:15,280
three parts per million the way I write

654
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:15,280
that is 3 ppm and if I did the math 3

655
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:22,909
divided by a million okay so on this

656
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:27,110
graph that we are going to look at here

657
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:28,060
the y-axis is usually in ppm parts per

658
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:32,750
million

659
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:35,450
all right so a couple years after

660
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,970
Charles Keeling turns on his machine and

661
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,570
he starts to get data this is the this

662
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,570
is what he sees

663
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:54,960
he sees this up-down pattern I might try

664
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:57,390
to focus and he also sees that this this

665
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,880
up-down pattern is gradually increasing

666
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,860
and he knows that this is pretty

667
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,350
significant so there's two things going

668
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:07,560
on and we got to separate them out first

669
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:13,380
is what's causing the up-down pattern

670
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:15,630
okay now on earth we have what we call

671
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,830
deciduous trees these are trees that in

672
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:22,350
the spring they bud out and as you start

673
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,820
to grow there's a growing season the

674
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,920
leaves get bigger in order for the

675
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,500
leaves to get bigger the plant has to

676
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,770
pull co2 out of the atmosphere okay

677
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,840
so throughout the summer the deciduous

678
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,330
plant the sigils tree whatever it is is

679
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,010
growing growing growing growing and is

680
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,240
pulling carbon dioxide out of the air

681
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,320
and it's making you know from

682
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,650
photosynthesis so then coming to the

683
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:51,120
fall the deciduous tree loses its leaves

684
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:52,830
the leaves follow to the ground now that

685
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,380
carbon that it took out of the

686
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:56,850
atmosphere a lot of it is now laying on

687
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,940
the ground in the form of dead leaves

688
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:03,630
and all the microorganisms are munching

689
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:08,130
away and digesting that and that carbon

690
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:11,820
goes back up into the atmosphere so in a

691
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:14,430
normal year for a particular if you

692
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,410
think of just one deciduous tree in the

693
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,290
spring and into the summer the growing

694
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:22,320
season it's taken co2 out of the air in

695
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:24,120
the fall in the winter it's actually

696
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,830
adding co2 back into the air because

697
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:31,650
it's dumped off all of its leaves okay

698
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,660
so now imagine a set of one plant doing

699
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,770
that

700
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,700
imagine all the plants in the world

701
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:43,140
doing that so because the seasons are

702
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,100
reversed when we have summer in the or

703
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,950
let's say spring in the northern

704
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,900
hemisphere our plants in the northern

705
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,300
hemisphere are starting to bud out and

706
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,750
they are sucking down co2 out of the

707
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,920
atmosphere but at the same exact time

708
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,830
the plants and the southern hemisphere

709
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,710
are experiencing fall and their leaves

710
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,190
are falling off

711
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,170
and that's adding co2 to the atmosphere

712
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:07,329
so the two hemispheres the plants and

713
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:10,420
the two hemispheres balance each other

714
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:12,670
out but when you look at the two

715
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,309
hemispheres what you see is that there's

716
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,430
way more land in the northern hemisphere

717
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:21,369
than there is in the southern hemisphere

718
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:23,650
okay so what does that mean that means

719
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:25,829
that there's more plants in the northern

720
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:28,660
hemisphere than the southern hemisphere

721
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:31,630
so that means that when we're talking

722
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,730
about competing seasons then nor the

723
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,309
plants in the northern hemisphere are

724
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:38,380
the ones that actually are in control of

725
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:40,540
the carbon in the atmosphere because

726
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,160
there's more of them so even though

727
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,440
these you know if the hemispheres were

728
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,210
perfectly balanced if there was the same

729
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,520
amount of land in each and the same

730
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,050
amount of plants in each as one was

731
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,359
losing its leaves and the other was

732
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,400
budding out leaves the two effects would

733
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:56,260
cancel each other out they don't cancel

734
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,700
each other out because we've got more

735
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:03,040
plants in the north okay so if we could

736
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:09,160
so thinking about that then if we

737
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:12,220
consider this this up and down is being

738
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:17,260
controlled by what the plants in the

739
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:19,780
north are doing right so let say we'll

740
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,490
start in the fall and the leaves fall

741
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,500
off in the fall and they fall on the

742
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:27,460
ground and that returns co2 to the

743
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:32,440
atmosphere so that means that where we

744
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:36,280
see co2 increasing that's starting in

745
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:41,559
the fall and it continues throughout the

746
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:44,020
winter in the northern hemisphere in the

747
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:50,790
northern hemisphere okay so the seasons

748
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:50,790
I'm writing are northern hemisphere

749
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:58,170
okay so co2 gets returned gets returned

750
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:00,450
gets returned and then we finally get to

751
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,089
the spring and things start to bud out

752
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:06,510
and as they do they start pulling co2

753
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:13,170
out of the atmosphere so we get into

754
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:17,010
spring and as we go down this way this

755
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:23,270
is the growing season and into the

756
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:27,780
summer and then it repeats again fall

757
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:30,900
into winter etc so this up and down that

758
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,300
we're seeing that's due to plants and

759
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,050
it's due to the plants in the northern

760
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,579
hemisphere because we have more of them

761
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:41,310
okay so that's the first thing Keeling

762
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:43,740
notices but the second thing Keeling

763
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:46,170
notices is perhaps more important than

764
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:51,329
that which is that this whole pattern is

765
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:54,990
on the way up and he realizes even after

766
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:58,530
just a few years of data that this slope

767
00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:05,300
is due to us to humans burning fossil

768
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:11,400
fuels so this is the human co2

769
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:14,069
contribution that's adding on top of

770
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,589
what the plants are doing so you can

771
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:22,980
kind of think of it like this if there

772
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:29,040
was a world with no humans we would

773
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:34,980
expect that it would do this it would

774
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:36,930
cycle with the seasons of the northern

775
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,410
hemisphere because of the because again

776
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:48,540
of the plants but it's doing this

777
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:50,990
instead because every year we are adding

778
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,990
more

779
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:59,619
to the atmosphere and so every year we

780
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:59,619
progressively add more and more and more

781
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:08,780
so here are some data from Hawaii just

782
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:11,750
the last few years okay and you can see

783
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,540
there's this the red the up and down

784
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,369
those are the seasons and then this

785
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:22,280
black line is sort of a mathematical

786
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:22,970
average over time and I go forward one

787
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,540
more here

788
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:28,070
so here's for example just the last few

789
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,280
measurements of the last few days when I

790
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:34,130
write before I recorded this we have

791
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:39,619
surpassed 400 parts per million now for

792
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:41,150
a couple of years and as seasons as you

793
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:44,240
know right now we're going into the

794
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,220
northern hemisphere spring so we should

795
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,700
actually expect some of these numbers to

796
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,590
start to go back down here a little bit

797
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,800
this is what it looks like today up

798
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:56,300
there there's a lot of instrumentation

799
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,640
they're measuring all kinds of stuff up

800
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,230
here that at the center for

801
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,810
stratospheric research is what they

802
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:07,430
called and so I actually went there a

803
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:14,270
few years ago to do some research in my

804
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:16,130
own and this building right here that's

805
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:18,920
the building that has that bronze plaque

806
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:22,550
on it so here's another picture of it's

807
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,050
this right in here and this is all this

808
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:26,359
is really awful in mr. the public is

809
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,790
just scientists you know super nerds

810
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:31,280
walking around here but if you go inside

811
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:34,130
this building this is what it looks like

812
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:38,359
and there's this box right here in this

813
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:40,280
really old chart recorder and you open

814
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:44,800
it up and there's a piece of plexiglass

815
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,210
here and this is one of the original of

816
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,000
this is one of the original machines

817
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,560
that Charles Keeling made is technically

818
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,650
not the first one because the very first

819
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,390
one I guess got taken apart but it's

820
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,340
essentially the first one so all the

821
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,780
scientists they are I go oh my god they

822
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,300
get so excited you can see my reflection

823
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:05,300
taking a picture of it in there but this

824
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,250
is the first a co2 monitor

825
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,590
since Charles Keeling put that in on the

826
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,570
top of Hawaii we've been putting them in

827
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,380
all over the world and it's the same

828
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:18,370
pattern everywhere

829
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:20,510
it's that same up-down but climbing co2

830
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:23,000
so one thing we'd like to know as

831
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:26,030
climate scientists is how much

832
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,570
greenhouse gas was in the atmosphere in

833
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,910
the past whether it be co2 or methane or

834
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,530
whatever so we have killings machine

835
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:38,300
that's been taking measurements since

836
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:41,300
1958 but how much co2 is in the

837
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:45,050
atmosphere say 100 years before that or

838
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:47,480
100 years before that so there's a

839
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,850
couple ways you can do it some people

840
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,580
have found sealed bottle old bottles

841
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:55,100
with air in it and analyze that so maybe

842
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,050
you find an old bottle from you know 150

843
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,530
years ago you can analyze the air in

844
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:03,440
there but further back you go the harder

845
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:07,420
it is and so one of the ways that we do

846
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,650
it is if you find a place that has been

847
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:14,480
frozen consecutively without ever

848
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:17,180
experiencing any melting that you can

849
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,940
actually find trapped atmospheric gas in

850
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:24,350
the ice so snow itself fresh snow so if

851
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:28,700
you're a skier think of like some fresh

852
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:30,590
powder that's like 90% air but then

853
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,410
after the snow sits on the ground for a

854
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,160
while it very slowly starts to

855
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:38,240
recrystallize

856
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,750
and that fluffy snow kind of gets gritty

857
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:45,710
and granular and then eventually it

858
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:47,990
turns into something called fern and if

859
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:50,870
it's a place that never ever actually

860
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:53,990
melts what'll happen is those nice

861
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:57,940
fluffy snowflakes eventually turn into

862
00:44:53,990 --> 00:45:02,660
solid ice and the air that fell as snow

863
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:05,420
gets encapsulated as a little bubbles so

864
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:08,900
this is what it looks like so the little

865
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,140
bubbles in this ice our old trapped

866
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:15,470
pockets of atmosphere the atmospheric

867
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:17,030
gases from when this ice first formed so

868
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,160
this piece of ice is a thousand years

869
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,020
old

870
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,859
then the bubbles in there are little

871
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,589
samples of thousand-year-old atmosphere

872
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:29,890
so this only works if you have a place

873
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:32,760
that never gets above the freezing point

874
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:36,520
right stays frozen all year round so

875
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,280
there's two main places that we can do

876
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:43,960
this one is Antarctica and the middle

877
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,650
Antarctica never melts and middle of

878
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,109
Greenland

879
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,579
now there's also some places you can go

880
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:50,980
and do this on the continent where you

881
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:53,530
have glaciers year-round those glaciers

882
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:57,430
are disappearing but people are still

883
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:59,440
trying to sample them so if you want to

884
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:01,030
do this you get yourself some Russians

885
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,010
because they really like the cold

886
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:08,319
they go out to a place like Antarctica

887
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:11,460
and they set up these geodesic dome tent

888
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:14,289
things and they drill down into the ice

889
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,140
so this is specially designed drill to

890
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:19,630
drill down into the ice and remove what

891
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,779
we call an ice core so they're trying to

892
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:25,839
recover the ice without destroying it

893
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:28,420
and this is what I score looks like so

894
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:32,109
they'll drill down thousands of feet and

895
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:36,039
keep removing ice and the ice that they

896
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:39,460
remove when they pull it out and polish

897
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,710
it you can see the individual years so

898
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:45,190
in a place like Antarctica you only get

899
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:48,339
a couple centimeters of snow a year but

900
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:50,380
it just never melts and so each band is

901
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:52,720
a year and the bubbles that are

902
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:55,420
preserved in each band have a little

903
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,690
sample of the atmosphere from that time

904
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:02,260
when they were that ice formed so what

905
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,539
you can do is if you drill down enough

906
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:07,119
you can go down thousands of years you

907
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:11,140
can extract air thousands of years ago

908
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:13,029
and they store this ice in these giant

909
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,950
warehouses that are kept below freezing

910
00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:17,349
so each one of these tubes has an ice

911
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:19,510
core in it now let's say your site I

912
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:22,299
climate scientists you know I I would

913
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:25,900
like to find the atman samples of the

914
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:27,039
atmosphere 50,000 years ago so what you

915
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,039
do is you go to one of these facilities

916
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:32,769
and you find ice that's 50 thousand

917
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:34,779
years old and there's a whole set

918
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:36,999
with saws and everything everything in

919
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:39,220
this warehouse is kept below freezing

920
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:42,940
and you cut out the ice you're

921
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,339
interested in and you seal it in glass

922
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:48,609
and then you melt it and then the

923
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:51,549
bubbles come out and it's sealed in this

924
00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:53,190
glass that you put it in and then you

925
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:56,789
extract the gas out and you analyze it

926
00:47:53,190 --> 00:48:00,839
so using this technique we can actually

927
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:03,460
recreate the atmosphere all the way back

928
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:05,470
several hundred thousand years so

929
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,839
Antarctica has been below freezing for

930
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,549
several hundred thousand years so in

931
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,430
this graph what they've done is they've

932
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:17,140
reconstructed co2 parts-per-million

933
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:18,160
and here is today now this graph has

934
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,160
made a few years ago

935
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,279
so today the co2 level is higher it's

936
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:27,190
kind of like up in here now but they

937
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:30,720
went back now this graph goes back says

938
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:34,720
400,000 years and then it says for

939
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:37,960
650,000 years atmospheric co2 was never

940
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,470
higher than this level so we can with

941
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:44,349
with Antarctica we can actually go back

942
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,930
pretty close to a million years before

943
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:48,970
you run out of ice when we extract the

944
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:50,880
ice and we analyze the gases what we

945
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,890
find is that for the past million years

946
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:57,519
we've never seen co2 as high as it is

947
00:48:53,890 --> 00:49:02,499
today ok now you see these big patterns

948
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:04,140
right so here the co2 was pretty low we

949
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:07,839
were in what we would call an ice age

950
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:10,119
here the co2 was higher so that so earth

951
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:14,680
was warmer then we've got another Ice

952
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:15,910
Age warmer these are natural cycles and

953
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,039
there's changes in the Earth's orbit

954
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:20,319
that caused this okay so we're not

955
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:22,630
worried about that like this is we know

956
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:26,920
what does this what we're worried about

957
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:28,630
is this that we now have more co2 in the

958
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,930
atmosphere than the earth is seen in the

959
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:34,960
last million years or maybe more and the

960
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:37,059
question is what is the earth going to

961
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,239
do how is the atmosphere going to

962
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:45,760
respond we can also look at other

963
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:47,170
greenhouse gases so this is years ago

964
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,510
I think it got cut offs it's time to

965
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:52,030
forked 2005 when this was made and

966
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,950
they're looking at methane and now

967
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,950
they're looking at ppb parts per billion

968
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,480
they're getting it out of the ice so you

969
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,390
can see from about ten thousand years

970
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,200
ago to pretty close to the present day

971
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:08,110
there wasn't a lot of variation in

972
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,760
methane remember methane is a pretty

973
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:11,230
strong greenhouse gas there's not much

974
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,540
of it in the atmosphere but it's a

975
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,800
pretty strong gas and then starting

976
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,630
there and they're zooming in here is

977
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,010
what they're doing starting about you

978
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:23,230
know 1900 or so we see a big uptick in

979
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:25,420
methane so methane is probably higher

980
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:28,630
now than it's been in the past million

981
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,700
years or if you remember from the last

982
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:34,300
lecture another a strong greenhouse gas

983
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:36,280
is nitrous oxide again parts per billion

984
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,500
there's not a lot in the atmosphere that

985
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,790
you see some error bars so it's it's

986
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,000
there's more uncertainty in the

987
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,310
measurements but again back ten thousand

988
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,660
years ago

989
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:48,790
the amount of nitrous oxide stayed

990
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:52,330
pretty constant until we get to again

991
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:53,950
about late 1800s 1900 and it starts to

992
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,140
take off again that's higher now than

993
00:50:53,950 --> 00:51:00,250
it's been in the last hundred thousand

994
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:01,240
year our last million years or so so one

995
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,650
of the things they've done is

996
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,290
reconstructed what we call the

997
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:08,260
pre-industrial atmospheric concentration

998
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:12,970
so we talked about the industrial age

999
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:15,220
that roughly correlates to like 1800 ish

1000
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:18,370
or 1850 different definitions of

1001
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:20,350
industrial revolution but sort of when

1002
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:25,210
humans started with steam engines and

1003
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:29,230
burning a lot of coal C 1850 we'll just

1004
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:31,750
use that as a number co2 is about 280

1005
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:35,410
parts per million so in other words if

1006
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:37,750
the industrial revolution didn't happen

1007
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:40,750
in all the things that humans have done

1008
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:42,820
since then didn't happen we'd expect the

1009
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,980
atmosphere to have about 280 parts per

1010
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:48,970
million and as we just saw a few slides

1011
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:50,920
ago it's currently over 400 they've also

1012
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:53,980
established some other ones methane

1013
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:57,130
nitrous oxide few others but these

1014
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:59,380
numbers here the pre-industrial amounts

1015
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:02,830
that is what

1016
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:04,480
the concentrations should be and then

1017
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,830
these numbers here are what they

1018
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,570
currently are and actually this is

1019
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:12,240
already obsolete so they're even higher

1020
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:12,240
than what is what is shown here

1021
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:22,300
so in conclusion whether you look at co2

1022
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,830
or methane or nitrous oxide we've got

1023
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,940
more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere

1024
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:27,550
right now

1025
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:31,870
then the earth is seen in the past about

1026
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:35,020
million years maybe more what's going to

1027
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:38,500
happen and the short answer is we're not

1028
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:40,860
totally sure so we know that there are

1029
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:44,290
natural variations in greenhouse gases

1030
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:47,230
so we saw the co2 go up and down in the

1031
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:50,530
past but it's never been as high as it

1032
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:54,100
is today so one of the questions is what

1033
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:55,150
is the climate system going to do and

1034
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,100
we're going to talk more about this in

1035
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:59,500
the future lecture but one of the big

1036
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:02,530
worries is we're not totally sure what

1037
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,720
is going to do we know things are

1038
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:07,750
warming up we can predict how they're

1039
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,240
going to warm more in the future but

1040
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,500
could there be something else that's

1041
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,110
going to happen and we'll talk more

1042
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:17,070
about that in a future lecture all right

1043
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,070
thanks

1044
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,160
you
