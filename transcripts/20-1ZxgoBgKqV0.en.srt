00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:09,929
hey this is Mel and in this lecture I'm

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,370
going to be talking about some of the

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,929
evidence for global warming and so in

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,189
this class you've been reading this book

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,080
and so far you've read parts one two

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,060
three and four

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,240
we've got exam number three coming up

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,349
and an exam number three we're going to

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,210
be focusing on among other things the

10
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,500
evidence for global warming

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,480
now you've been reading about other

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,850
things and some of that some of those

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,489
other things will be in exam number four

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,010
so what I want to do in this lecture and

15
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,010
the one that follows is go through some

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,020
of these diagrams the charts the maps

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,239
that have been in your book and some of

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,239
the concepts and try to explain in more

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,770
detail what they're talking about here

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:02,640
and hopefully they'll make a little more

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:07,049
sense so to start here's an example of a

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,119
graph that was in your book and yours is

23
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,970
is very similar to this it may not look

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,430
quite exactly like it but on the y-axis

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,460
that says temperature difference

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:20,240
compared to the 1951 to 1980 mean and

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,799
there's a bunch of red dots here and

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:29,180
each dot by itself represents a global

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,810
temperature for for a whole year

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:36,600
compared to a 30-year average okay so

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,979
there's a lot kind of embedded in this

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,570
and I want to make sure we all

33
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,570
understand what they're what they're

34
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,950
showing here okay so first of all each

35
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:50,100
red dot imagine how complicated it would

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,659
be to try to come up with one number to

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,340
represent the temperature of the earth

38
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,520
you've got all the different locations

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,320
you've got the different seasons and you

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,869
throw all that together over a whole

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,270
year and you come up with one number and

42
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,460
that's not easy to do now with modern

43
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,229
records it's pretty easy with satellite

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,970
data we have satellites that can measure

45
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,160
the temperatures of the surface of the

46
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,319
earth and come up with a number pretty

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,310
easily when you go further back in time

48
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,860
because it gets

49
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,020
harder you've got to rely on weather

50
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,530
stations on the ground and weather

51
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,120
stations on ships and buoys and it's you

52
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,349
know you have to kind of integrate all

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,120
these measurements and people have

54
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,239
argued about exactly the best way of

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,980
doing it and we don't have time to

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,290
really dig into the details about how

57
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,060
that is done except we kind of have to

58
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,980
accept that they know what they are

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,739
doing when they came up with these with

60
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,260
these numbers so that's the first thing

61
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,060
is every red dot is one number for the

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,310
whole planet for the whole year the

63
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,959
other thing that they've done instead of

64
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,410
saying that the global average

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,019
temperature is a particular number like

66
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,700
54 degrees Fahrenheit or whatever it is

67
00:02:54,019 --> 00:03:00,690
they're not doing that they're comparing

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,930
it to a 30-year average now remember we

69
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,180
said in an earlier lecture that 30 years

70
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,099
is a number that we use for calculating

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,500
climate we have this term climate norm

72
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,599
climate normal it's a 30-year average so

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,269
what they've done here is they've taken

74
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,090
all the temperatures for the world from

75
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,280
1951 to 1980 so that's a 30-year average

76
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,890
and they average the whole thing

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,450
together and came up with one number

78
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,850
whatever that is let's just say it's 54

79
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:32,549
degrees Fahrenheit and then they said

80
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,900
okay how much did this one vary compared

81
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,000
to that average now they're doing

82
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,670
maitland degree centigrade so the

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,540
numbers above zero so this dot right

84
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:47,030
here would be 0.2 degrees centigrade

85
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,609
above the 1951 to 1980 average okay

86
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,340
so between 1951 which would be right

87
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,239
about here in 1980 which would be right

88
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,489
about there

89
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,709
these Nevers are bouncing back and forth

90
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,410
they're hovering around the zero mark

91
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,440
because that's how they actually defined

92
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,900
this graph they're comparing it to this

93
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,000
30-year average so the numbers that are

94
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,030
in that 30 year time period are going to

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,769
be pretty close to zero on the other

96
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,690
hand you have these numbers that are

97
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:19,709
negative and what that means is that

98
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,200
these years were colder than this 30

99
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,200
years so it's in my opinion it's a very

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,390
confusing way to show data like this but

101
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,900
this is how it's done so we kind of have

102
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,639
to

103
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,380
get in the mind of a climate scientist

104
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,750
they always want to compare something to

105
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,630
a 30-year average so they picked this

106
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,000
this segment for their 30 years and

107
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,190
they're calculating each year and

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,850
they're comparing it to that 30 year

109
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,210
average

110
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,930
so negative just means we were colder

111
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,320
than this 1950 to 1980 average and the

112
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,270
positive numbers means that we're warmer

113
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:58,800
compared to that 1950 the 1980 average

114
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:02,910
okay but the actual number isn't so

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,530
important as the trend so a big idea

116
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,530
that I want you to get out of this class

117
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,500
is that when we talk about climate

118
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,020
change we're looking for long-term

119
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,139
trends in the data okay that's a huge

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,229
idea here so if you go to year to year

121
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,210
right so if I just pick some some

122
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:24,840
arbitrary year here and I say well here

123
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,630
the temperature relatively was

124
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,580
relatively low it jumps up and then it

125
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:34,289
goes back down and back up and back down

126
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,539
and year to year it doesn't show that

127
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,610
it's actually getting warmer every

128
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,360
single year and this is a huge

129
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,010
misconception some people say well

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,349
global warming must mean it's getting

131
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,539
warmer every year but what this graph

132
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:51,300
shows is no it's not getting warmer

133
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,229
every year this year right here was

134
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,630
colder than the year before right and so

135
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,580
some climate change critics or global

136
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,440
warming critics would say a hot seat

137
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,720
global warming is not real because we

138
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,270
actually have years that were colder

139
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,669
than the prior year therefore it can't

140
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,010
be getting warmer but that's not what we

141
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,590
mean by global warming what we mean is

142
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,500
that if you look at this graph what's

143
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,389
the overall trend the overall trend as

144
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,000
things are going up and up and up and

145
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:25,139
yes there are year two your average of

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,240
changes why for example do we have these

147
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,580
white you know why was it warm this year

148
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,889
and then dip down it the year after a

149
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,370
lot of this has to do with El Nino La

150
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:38,610
Nina so an El Nino you're exposing a big

151
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,350
part of the equatorial Pacific warm

152
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,570
water to the atmosphere that helps

153
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,180
warming the planet a little bit in along

154
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,190
Nina you expose a lot of cold water

155
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,140
along the equatorial region that makes

156
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,540
the pine a little bit cooler so a lot of

157
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,630
this kind of crazy up-and-down is long

158
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,220
Nina El Nino we kind of in our minds

159
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,960
have to kind of filter that out and say

160
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,480
okay yeah there's a lot of crazy up and

161
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,730
down but what's the overall trend and

162
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,240
the overall trend is higher and higher

163
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,190
and higher temperatures okay it's worth

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,510
pointing out there is something weird

165
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:15,390
happening here and we did talk about

166
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:17,340
this in the book a little bit we were

167
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,710
you can kind of kind of get from this

168
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,100
that from about you know 1910 or so

169
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,500
onwards we're warming and then in the

170
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,170
40s we kind of cool off a little bit

171
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,140
until the 70s and we start to get warmer

172
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,630
again right well why did this cooling

173
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,340
happen this is air pollution the air

174
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,530
pollution around the planet got so bad

175
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,990
it was actually reflecting sunlight and

176
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,000
cooling things down and you remember in

177
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,740
a previous lecture in the 1970s we

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,010
passed the Clean Air Act in this country

179
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,960
and that helped clean the air quite a

180
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,370
bit in other countries around the world

181
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,870
we didn't really talk about them but

182
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,130
started to also pass similar laws so we

183
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,550
see that the atmosphere is actually

184
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,740
starting the cleaner after 1970 and that

185
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,310
pollutions going away and we see the

186
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,450
warming then coming back as a result

187
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,710
okay so big picture here global warming

188
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,260
doesn't mean it's getting warmer every

189
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,930
year it means that the overall trend is

190
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,550
increasing temperatures the fact that

191
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,610
you have a year that's colder than the

192
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,790
year before does not invalidate global

193
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:27,500
warming it's just it is some noise and

194
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,940
the data that's what we say also they do

195
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,980
climate scientists typically do this

196
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,860
funny thing where they compare it to a

197
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,630
30-year average so if you're colder than

198
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,760
that 30 year average you end up with

199
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,140
negative numbers and that kind of like

200
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,200
if you're not used to these coming

201
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,190
graphs it doesn't make a lot of sense

202
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:52,350
okay another type of graph that you saw

203
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:54,529
was looking at the warming in your book

204
00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:00,059
so this is on page

205
00:08:54,529 --> 00:09:03,990
35 and it says changing global surface

206
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,220
temperature 1901 to 2012 and it says

207
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,290
under that notice that the pattern of

208
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,149
warming is not uniform land regions for

209
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,709
example have warm more than the oceans

210
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,079
okay so there's a couple things I really

211
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:15,839
want you to get from this first of all

212
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,930
this gray how it's gray down here that's

213
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,379
gray up here that means that we haven't

214
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,420
had temperature records that are robust

215
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,999
enough for long enough to be able to

216
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,040
save for scientific certainty what's

217
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:32,069
happening now in a minute I will show

218
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,689
you some graphs where we we do kind of

219
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:36,420
know what's happening here but for this

220
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:37,920
one since nineteen no you know back in

221
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,139
1901 there weren't a lot of people

222
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,230
taking temperatures in the North Pole or

223
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,879
the Antarctic right so we can't say a

224
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,100
hundred percent for a certain what's

225
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,360
changed there and so that's why this is

226
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,709
great that doesn't mean there's no

227
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,259
warming it just means we don't have

228
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:54,480
records of it also you'll see some other

229
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,779
places in here with this in gray like in

230
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,069
the middle of Africa again 1901 nobody's

231
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,889
taken temperatures in the middle of

232
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:04,050
Africa and making really nice records so

233
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,629
one of the big points that I want you to

234
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:10,649
get from this is that the warming is not

235
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:12,240
distributed evenly you see a lot more of

236
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:14,279
it on the continents than you do in the

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,529
oceans and you see a lot more of it in

238
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,899
the northern hemisphere than you do in

239
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:24,240
the in the south so that's one thing I

240
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:26,519
can just notice the other thing is if

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,439
you look at the scale down here they're

242
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:33,269
looking for changes over this you know

243
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:36,089
one hundred and twelve year period blue

244
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:38,939
means it got a little bit colder in that

245
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,309
hundred years and all these other colors

246
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:43,769
means that it's gotten warmer and you'll

247
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:46,529
notice that right up here there is a

248
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,660
little blob of blue which means that in

249
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,569
fact there's a couple little specks over

250
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,079
here too and so what this means is that

251
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,670
the the world is actually there's a

252
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,920
couple places where the world has gotten

253
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,910
a little bit cooler in the last hundred

254
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:06,790
years according to this now a climate

255
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:09,310
change critic will say aha see that

256
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,230
global warming must not be true because

257
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,450
if the world was getting warmer

258
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,300
then you wouldn't expect places to

259
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,100
actually be getting colder okay so this

260
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,230
is another misconception about global

261
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,180
warming global warming does not mean the

262
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,540
entire globe is getting warmer even

263
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,730
though that's kind of the implication

264
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,920
so what global warming actually means is

265
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,320
that if you mathematically average this

266
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,920
whole thing right take all the colors

267
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,250
into account and you were to add it all

268
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,810
up what would then that result be right

269
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,940
if you look at all the oranges and

270
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,890
yellows and Red's yeah there's a couple

271
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,200
little specks here where it's a little

272
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,180
bit blue right and those are those are

273
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,790
where it's gotten cooler but if you

274
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,470
averaged this whole thing the globe was

275
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,930
definitely getting warmer it's a

276
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,850
mathematical average now why would it

277
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,760
actually beginning colder in places like

278
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,040
how why would that even happen so there

279
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,280
was a couple reasons one is you could

280
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,810
have it shift in ocean currents so if

281
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,880
you remember the Gulf Stream the Gulf

282
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,840
Stream comes out here and it takes warm

283
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,600
water to the north

284
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,150
well that Gulf Stream is becoming weaker

285
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,760
with the time which means it's pumping

286
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:21,220
less warm water to the North Atlantic

287
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:25,600
and therefore this region up here is

288
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,780
getting cooler here's another version of

289
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,660
this map that is not in your book but

290
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,160
it's similar to and this one is a little

291
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,400
different what they're doing is they are

292
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,930
again comparing out the temperatures

293
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,670
today to a 1951 to 1980 mean right so

294
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,920
they're taking a 30-year average and

295
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,660
they're looking at temperatures today am

296
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,700
i today I mean I think this is a couple

297
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,590
years old now and comparing how the

298
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,920
earth is now compared to that thirty

299
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:58,030
year period in the past right so if you

300
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,740
do that this is more modern this doesn't

301
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,160
go all the way back to 1901 so we have

302
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,750
more modern records and we see that a

303
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,120
lot of the warming the majority of the

304
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,060
warming is up in the north okay up in

305
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,030
the above the Arctic Circle we also see

306
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:16,030
there's more warming over the continents

307
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:18,670
in the oceans and we also see more zones

308
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,180
here of cooling right there's more

309
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:24,110
cooling here

310
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,270
in the oceans and again ye you know does

311
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,680
this invalidate global warming no if I

312
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,360
mathematically average this whole

313
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,360
picture together I still get a number

314
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,210
that's positive right it's the whole

315
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,410
thing on average is getting warmer even

316
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,950
though there's places that are getting

317
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,600
cooler so again why would places

318
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,920
beginning cooler there's several things

319
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,140
that could be at play here

320
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,380
you could have changing ocean currents

321
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,600
you could also have changing patterns of

322
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,390
storms so think about the mid-latitude

323
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,670
cyclones if you change the direction of

324
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,740
a mid-latitude cyclone so let's say you

325
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,240
increase the likelihood that the path of

326
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,940
the mid-latitude cyclone will come down

327
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,520
here this region down here will have

328
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,490
more cloudy days and have in it we'll

329
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,470
end up with lower temperatures so when

330
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,840
you see these zones out in the oceans

331
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,160
that are cooler doesn't mean the Earth's

332
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,680
getting cooler it just means we're

333
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,050
probably changing directions of storms

334
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,170
or directions the ocean currents which

335
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,120
are changing zones out in the ocean but

336
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,370
not necessarily changing the overall

337
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,480
pattern around the earth in terms of the

338
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,540
overall temperature change okay so this

339
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,730
is a map that's not in your book but

340
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,340
it's pretty important and what we're

341
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,260
looking at is warming and this map is

342
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,720
actually for the past few decades and

343
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,060
we're looking at how much the atmosphere

344
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,190
has changed temperature so this says

345
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,840
troposphere up here and what we're

346
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,030
looking at really is what how the

347
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,460
temperature is about 10 kilometers above

348
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,170
our head has changed okay that's what

349
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,080
they're showing so the colors are

350
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,550
similar as the other maps red means that

351
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,110
it's getting warmer blue means it's

352
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,740
gotten colder white means it hasn't

353
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,260
changed grey means we don't any data

354
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,880
okay so notice that there's some big

355
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,000
differences between this one and that

356
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,430
and the last maps we were looking at so

357
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,560
one difference is you don't see the big

358
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,500
contrast so much between the continents

359
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,390
and the oceans right you still kind of

360
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,390
notice more warming appeared to the

361
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,600
north but the big thing I want you to

362
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:31,120
pay attention to on this map is how we

363
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,530
have a band that's right through here

364
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,630
and we have another band

365
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,790
that's right through here okay so in

366
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,640
other words all of this pink has been

367
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,360
getting warmer but the areas that have B

368
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,490
have been getting especially warmer are

369
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,370
centered kind of right through here and

370
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,080
right through here so I want you to

371
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,570
think about something that we talked

372
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:58,910
about in a previous lecture that kind of

373
00:15:53,570 --> 00:16:00,650
lines up with this and this and if you

374
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,170
can remember what we talked about in

375
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:07,010
global circulation in that lecture as we

376
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:09,280
talked about how air rises along the

377
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,080
ITCZ which is kind of near the equator

378
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,750
but then it sinks back down about 30

379
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,090
degrees north 30 degrees south those are

380
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,720
called the subtropical highs and they

381
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,910
change with the seasons okay well great

382
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,890
for here that's about 30 degrees south

383
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:29,330
and right up here is about 30 degrees

384
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:30,920
north so what we see for example is like

385
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,810
right through here this is one of the

386
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:38,300
subtropical highs and we see that it's

387
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,270
gotten even warmer than the surrounding

388
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,850
area this is where we expect to find the

389
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,280
Bermuda high it's gotten even warmer

390
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,440
than usual this is where we expect to

391
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,440
find the Pacific subtropical high it's

392
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,510
gettin warmer than usual and even here

393
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,510
over the continent is also part of the

394
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:59,200
Pacific subtropical high sometimes so

395
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,600
what does this mean

396
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,670
sinking air warms okay we talked about

397
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,600
that a long time ago if I have the

398
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,970
Hadley cell air rises at the equator

399
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,480
sync song 30 degrees right that's the

400
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:18,310
whole the whole Hadley cycle if I make

401
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:21,290
the Headlee cell bigger and stronger I

402
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:24,260
have more air rising at the equator

403
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,830
which means I have more air sinking at

404
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,590
30 degrees which means I have more of

405
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:35,180
the compressed air warming than I did

406
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,350
before okay so so in a you know in a

407
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,050
world where there's no global warming

408
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:41,180
okay we we expect air to rise at the

409
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,240
equator we expect air to sink at 30

410
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:47,559
degrees and as it sinks down at worms

411
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,750
but that's it it's reaching up

412
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:53,480
state of equilibrium right well this is

413
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,240
what this is saying is that those Hagley

414
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,350
cells are getting stronger they're

415
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,539
getting bigger and they're getting

416
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,429
stronger and even though it's getting

417
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:03,950
warmer everywhere we're seeing

418
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:06,710
especially large amounts of warming

419
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,390
where the Headlee cells are coming down

420
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,760
and making those subtropical highs

421
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,100
you're compressing more and more air

422
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,779
coming down which makes it warmer at

423
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,710
this ultimately will make it warmer and

424
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:21,460
drier at the surface okay so why would

425
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:24,380
this happen if you mark the whole planet

426
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,330
remember why is air rising at the ITCZ

427
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,130
in the first place that's the warmest

428
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,940
part of the earth that's where the trade

429
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:34,519
winds converge so if you warm up the

430
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:38,090
whole planet this part along the equator

431
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:40,610
at the surface is getting warmer more

432
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,070
air is rising more air goes up to the

433
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:45,409
stratosphere more air sinks down about

434
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:50,029
30 degrees north south and when you get

435
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:52,340
stronger subtropical highs so what does

436
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:54,110
that mean for us well remember we are

437
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,360
living under the influence of the

438
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,370
Pacific subtropical high especially in

439
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,289
the winter and the spring in the fall

440
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,210
right it moves out of the way in the

441
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:05,299
summer but the rest of the year it

442
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:09,080
really dominates our weather us in New

443
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:11,690
Mexico in the southwest so if that gets

444
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,399
stronger then what does that mean for

445
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,010
our weather that means that our Pacific

446
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:18,769
our Pacific subtropical high will be

447
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:22,490
getting stronger we'll see more days of

448
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:25,490
clear skies less days of rain so overall

449
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,200
what this is telling us is as global

450
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,380
warming continues and as the Headlee

451
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,110
cells are getting stronger we can expect

452
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,100
more clear skies and less precipitation

453
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:40,789
in the future so another way that we can

454
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,649
look at evidence for climate change is

455
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:46,250
to look at something that we call a time

456
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:48,080
series of temperature in the very first

457
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,240
graph we started off with in this

458
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,789
lecture was a time series of temperature

459
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,130
for the whole planet but you have a

460
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:58,220
project this week and it's involves

461
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,710
making a time series of temperature for

462
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,280
a particular location and so I'm going

463
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,490
to kind of

464
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,810
show you how that's done and show you

465
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,880
the type of graphs that you're going to

466
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:12,680
be making so we can divide up the

467
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,090
country into these areas called climate

468
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,440
divisions and it kinda looks like

469
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,980
counties but they're bigger than

470
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,810
counties and all the areas within a

471
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,520
climate division are supposed to have

472
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,920
similar climates there's something

473
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,320
similar about them they have similar

474
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,250
topography or elevation or something and

475
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,740
so we kind of group them all together so

476
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:36,980
within each climate division you might

477
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,780
have say several hundred operating

478
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,000
weather stations and usually these

479
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,100
weather stations are recording data at

480
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,860
least once an hour sometimes once every

481
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,680
15 minutes or even more often than that

482
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,320
and so what we're going to do is we're

483
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:54,530
going to pull records from a climate

484
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,240
division and we're going to look at we

485
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:59,870
can look in what's how the temperatures

486
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,740
have changed in the past so here's an

487
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:05,420
example of a record that I pulled from a

488
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,280
climate division called the northern

489
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,890
mountains division so if I go back here

490
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,280
this blob right here that's the northern

491
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,200
mountains division and so what I've

492
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,050
asked this to do and this is what you'll

493
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,810
be doing on your project is I've

494
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:24,350
generated a series of these each one of

495
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,990
these as red dots represents a month of

496
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:30,320
data from hundreds of weather stations

497
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,470
across this whole region of the northern

498
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,530
mountains division okay so this dot

499
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,960
right here means that the computer went

500
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,510
to the database and it looked at all the

501
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,940
records for this month and so this is

502
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:47,300
December of 2014

503
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:50,030
ok and it looked at all the records kept

504
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:53,390
by all the weather stations in this area

505
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,980
day night the whole thing averaged the

506
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,070
entire thing together and come up with

507
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,800
one number for that entire month and

508
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,830
that's what's plotted here okay so every

509
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,020
one of these dots is one number for the

510
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,780
entire month of that particular year

511
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,370
averaged over this broad area with all

512
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,650
those weather stations which are

513
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,970
recording these are usually day/night at

514
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,080
least once an hour

515
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,480
okay so this is what this record looks

516
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,300
like and I went back a few years and you

517
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,170
can see there's this up down up down and

518
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:31,580
that's just the seasons right so summer

519
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:33,170
winter summer etc right and so from this

520
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,240
record if I asked you do you see any

521
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,800
evidence of climate change it'd be

522
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,050
pretty tough to see anything because

523
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,900
it's just what you're seeing is the

524
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,690
seasonal swing right okay so now what

525
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm going to do is I'm going to go back

526
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:51,440
more years so now I'm going to go back

527
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,210
20 years and look at how the

528
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,450
temperatures have been changing so now

529
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,510
again you can see summer winter summer

530
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,120
winter and again if I asked you do you

531
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:04,670
seen the evidence for changes it's

532
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,090
probably kind of hard to see a lot here

533
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,860
there's a lot of crazy up and down what

534
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,660
if I go back even further so now I'm

535
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:16,220
going back to 1940 so at first it just

536
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,710
looks like a crazy bunch of up and down

537
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,280
lines but you can start to use this

538
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,770
graph like this to notice a few changes

539
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,040
with time so let's look at the winners

540
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,760
okay so there's these horizontal lines

541
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,790
like here's a line this is 24 degrees

542
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,700
notice how many winners in the past got

543
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:41,800
colder than this 24 degree line right

544
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:45,680
and then notice what happens after 1990

545
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,590
you see no more winners get colder than

546
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,600
that 24 degree line now let me add what

547
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,360
remember what this means that 24 that

548
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,300
dot right there doesn't mean the winner

549
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,060
got down the 24 degrees once that's

550
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,540
average day and night over a whole month

551
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,920
right the entire month averaged below 24

552
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,890
degrees that's what that's what we're

553
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,920
talking about here but notice you can

554
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:12,320
see that how often that winners got down

555
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,810
to that 24 degree line and how often

556
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,140
they went below that in the past and

557
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,940
then starting about 1990 yeah there's a

558
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,180
few that reached that line but nobody

559
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,970
gets any colder below that or you could

560
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,140
look at the summers and say ok notice

561
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,720
that

562
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,240
you know here's a 69 degree line for

563
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,880
reference and you can see how often the

564
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,130
summers reach that 69 degree line and

565
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,430
either met it or maybe one a little bit

566
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,590
past it and if he again you just kind of

567
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,290
or just eyeballing this notice how much

568
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,840
white space there is between say the

569
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:51,200
sixty-four degree line and the 69 degree

570
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,920
line and then notice how much closer

571
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,300
these recent summers are to that 69

572
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,640
degree line there's a lot less of that

573
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,240
white space in here and you can kind of

574
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,910
see really the the number of summers

575
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,850
that that surpassed that 69 degree line

576
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,410
maybe isn't that that different but you

577
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,350
can see that overall they're getting

578
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,330
closer and closer to 69 degree line and

579
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,450
again 69 degrees doesn't sound that warm

580
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,890
but this is averaged over days and

581
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,750
nights and we're in the northern

582
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:27,350
mountains so the lot of these high

583
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:29,150
elevation data or you can even go

584
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,580
further back so now what I've done is

585
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,380
I've gone all the way back to 1908 right

586
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,350
so I've got a hundred years of data here

587
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,500
and I'm gonna use the same tricks notice

588
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:42,590
how often that winters got colder than

589
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,890
24 degrees in the past and then notice

590
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:48,770
that that stops over here and then

591
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,410
notice how often we get close to that 69

592
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:55,520
degree summer and then notice how often

593
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:58,550
we do it in modern times so you can just

594
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,250
kind of eyeball these and notice if

595
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:04,280
there's any changes in the long-term

596
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,350
trend there's obviously a lot of noise

597
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,970
what we call noise in this where we had

598
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:10,130
warm years and cool years and warm years

599
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,020
and cool years but what's the overall

600
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:16,700
trend that's what we're interested in

601
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:18,380
we're talking about climate change so

602
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,270
here's another one for example coming

603
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,750
from now we're in the Cascade Mountains

604
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:26,480
in Washington State and we're looking at

605
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:29,180
a hundred years of data and I'm the same

606
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,610
tricks notice how often the winners got

607
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,480
below this 22 degree mark right you see

608
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:37,340
these cold winters and they notice

609
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,890
starting in the 80s you no longer see

610
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,970
that right and in fact it's starting in

611
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,950
the 90s they don't

612
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,679
even hardly get below this 27 degree

613
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,600
line on the other hand we can look at

614
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,179
the summers how often did the summer has

615
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,220
breached the 62 degree mark notice how

616
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:56,000
much white space there is between the 57

617
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:58,970
and the 62 and then see what happens

618
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,549
here that we start to get summers that

619
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,270
are warmer than the 62 degree mark and

620
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:07,659
that white space between those two lines

621
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:10,130
disappears and so we're seeing a shift

622
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:13,159
towards warmer and warmer summers and

623
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,730
warmer and warmer winters and in fact

624
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,530
when we do the math with global warming

625
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,960
the biggest changes that we're seeing in

626
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,450
terms of temperatures as we're seeing

627
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,150
warmer nights and we're seeing warmer

628
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,789
winters yeah we're seeing some warmer

629
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,950
summers too but the biggest change like

630
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:32,990
mathematically that's happening is the

631
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,880
winners are getting warmer and the

632
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:40,130
nights are getting warmer and that's due

633
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:42,950
to the extra greenhouse gases okay so

634
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,690
besides just eyeballing some data that's

635
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,070
going up and down then trying to figure

636
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,710
out whether it's increasing or

637
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,720
decreasing scientists have more

638
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,250
quantitative ways of dealing with this

639
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,260
and I'm going to teach you one method

640
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,840
that we use it's called a running mean

641
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:00,940
or a running average so here's an

642
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,770
example here we've got temperatures from

643
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,809
days azar going by so let's just say

644
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:08,450
that each one of these dots represents

645
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,400
the average temperature for that 24 hour

646
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,250
period so we get a temperature on the y

647
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,640
axis we've got days on the on the x axis

648
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,460
and when I look at this data I can see

649
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,169
there's a lot of up and down right so so

650
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,280
temperatures are going up and down and

651
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:27,980
what I like to know is is there a

652
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:31,190
overall increasing trend or decreasing

653
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,990
trend or no trend in this okay that's

654
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:34,429
what we're trying to figure out so what

655
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:36,770
I'm going to do is apply something

656
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:45,799
called in this case I'm gonna call this

657
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:47,840
a five-day running average okay all

658
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,360
right so here's how this works first I'm

659
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,030
going to take the first five days one

660
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,890
two three four five and I'm going to

661
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,909
make like a window

662
00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:01,100
of this first five days of data and I'm

663
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:03,260
gonna calculate what the average is of

664
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,409
that five I'm gonna plot it in the

665
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:18,440
middle of the window okay so my first

666
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:28,070
five points are 34 40 137 no five six

667
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:32,899
seven 38 sorry 38 42 and 45 so I just

668
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:35,269
add those all up I divide by 5 and I get

669
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:38,840
an answer of 40 okay so the average of

670
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:42,260
all these is 40 so I'm gonna plot it

671
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:47,240
right in the center of my window so

672
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:48,769
there is my first point all right so I

673
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,169
just took the average of five plot it

674
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:53,840
plot it in the middle okay so now I'm

675
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:56,590
gonna take this this window and here's

676
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,269
the key I'm gonna move it over one day

677
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:05,029
okay so I'm gonna draw another one right

678
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:06,919
here here's my new window okay so I just

679
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:10,730
shifted it over one day and I'm gonna

680
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:29,110
calculate the whole thing all right so I

681
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:29,110
got 41 and 38 and 42 and 45 and 34

682
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:38,389
divided by 540 again okay so my new my

683
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,269
new window my new calculation come is

684
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:44,899
exactly same answer as it was before

685
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:49,580
so I plot that in the middle so then I'm

686
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:52,460
gonna shift it over one more so over one

687
00:30:49,580 --> 00:31:05,990
more and again I'm gonna calculate this

688
00:30:52,460 --> 00:31:14,960
new batch so 3847 45:34

689
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:19,279
and now a new point is 40 3/5 41.4 so

690
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,470
now the center of this window 41.4

691
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:27,020
something like this so I'm starting to

692
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:30,350
build this new graph of red dots that is

693
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:33,649
the long-term trend and so what I see is

694
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:36,350
it at first there's basically no change

695
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:38,539
in the long-term trend now starting to

696
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,340
move up and I can keep doing this by

697
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:42,590
moving this window over and over and

698
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,950
over and doing this calculations over

699
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:48,020
and over and over and I'll get another

700
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:50,990
line that tells me what the long-term

701
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,899
trend is it's called a running average

702
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:56,480
or a running mean very tedious to do

703
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:58,580
this by hand but easy for a computer to

704
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,039
do so part of what you're going to do in

705
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,929
your project is when when you get some

706
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,179
of these temperature records you're

707
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:07,159
gonna tell it to calculate the running

708
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:08,809
mean and it will just put it on your

709
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:13,520
graph so I'll show you some examples

710
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:15,770
here so here's an example of one of

711
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,870
these graphs where I have used a running

712
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,640
mean and I just asked the computer to do

713
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,950
it I didn't do any math myself and this

714
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,159
is a 12 month running mean and it

715
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,100
produces this blue line so it takes

716
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,870
every red point and takes six months

717
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,600
ahead and six months behind and

718
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:36,440
calculates what that running mean is and

719
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,919
plus it is blue okay so now what you can

720
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,720
see is the running mean and we're back

721
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,270
in northern mountains division the

722
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,120
running mean is bumping up and down

723
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,039
between this 44 degree mark and the 49

724
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,520
degree mark right it's kind of down here

725
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:56,659
and then you see when you get to the 90s

726
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:59,570
it stays closer to this 49 degree mark

727
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:02,630
and doesn't ever go back down to this 44

728
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,510
degree mark so the long-term average has

729
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,990
increased its average from somewhere

730
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:12,260
kind of down in here to somewhere up in

731
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:16,760
here okay or another example here's one

732
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:18,950
from Arizona and so here the again

733
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,760
12-month running mean you can see that

734
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,640
it's

735
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,730
we're here in the you know it's bouncing

736
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,130
back and forth between 61 and 63 degrees

737
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,470
back in the early part of the 20th

738
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:35,090
century and then when we get to the last

739
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:39,140
20 years it's now jumped up between the

740
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:41,630
61 and 63 did or sorry the 63 and a 65

741
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,390
degree mark up in here okay so we've

742
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,710
seen a shift in the overall long term

743
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,200
trend so this is how you're gonna use

744
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,780
the running mean you can you can have

745
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,340
the computer calculate it and look at it

746
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,990
and see if there's any trend now what if

747
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,060
there was no trend if there was no trend

748
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,070
then what we would see is we might see

749
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,540
some up and down the beginning of the

750
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,640
century and it just kind of remained

751
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,370
that same pattern all the way across

752
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,350
until today and that's how you would

753
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:09,409
know if there's any long-term trends in

754
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:11,659
the data so when climate scientists are

755
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,730
talking about global warming what we're

756
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,290
looking at is we're looking at actual

757
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,860
temperature measurements for the most

758
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:22,610
part and so in modern times say the last

759
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,260
30 years that comes from mostly

760
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,760
satellite data we've got satellites that

761
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,480
can measure the entire temperature of

762
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,340
the earth every day you go before

763
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,530
satellites then you're looking at

764
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,350
weather station data and before that

765
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,060
just thermometers and the farther back

766
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:41,530
you go the more difficult it is to

767
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:44,300
really get some good data now as

768
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,620
scientists that's what we look at when

769
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,480
we're trying to figure out whether the

770
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:52,190
earth is actually warming or not and

771
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,659
there are some in in popular media a lot

772
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,909
of times you'll hear that the reason

773
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:58,850
that scientists know that the earth is

774
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:00,530
warming is because of glaciers are doing

775
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,050
this or the polar bears are doing that

776
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,630
and those are effects of global warming

777
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,130
but that's not really the evidence the

778
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,020
evidence really comes from the

779
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,300
temperature data but I want to talk

780
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,480
about some of this other evidence

781
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,460
because you'll hear about that and one

782
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,830
of the things that we can look at that

783
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:23,590
lets us know that the earth is warming

784
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:26,480
is the decrease of ice on earth okay so

785
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:29,330
one example is we can look at how much

786
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,070
snow is on the ground in the northern

787
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:33,990
hemisphere during the spring

788
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,210
and one of the themes of this whole

789
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,310
lecture is that when we're talking about

790
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,630
climate change we're not looking at

791
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,300
what's happening from one year to the

792
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:45,120
next but it's the long-term right and so

793
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,190
you can see from this that from year to

794
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,070
year we have years where there is

795
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,990
relatively high amount of snow and then

796
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,000
we have relatively low amount and it

797
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,670
bounces back and forth but the overall

798
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,280
trend is kind of this downhill slope

799
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,470
here and if we go to something like the

800
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,900
Arctic sea ice which is the sea ice up

801
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,880
around the North Pole you know here's a

802
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,580
graph looking at the Arctic summer sea

803
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,680
ice extent and again we see ups and

804
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:14,220
downs but there's this overall trend

805
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,080
headed downhill so that's kind of what

806
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,360
we're seeing for climate change and

807
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,640
again just to reiterate we're not

808
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,830
looking at this and concluding that the

809
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,780
earth is getting warmer we're looking at

810
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:26,460
the temperature data and concluding the

811
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,590
earth is getting warmer but this is

812
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:33,540
another thing that we can see as

813
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:36,750
evidence so here is a animation showing

814
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,640
the extent of the Arctic sea ice from

815
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,770
year to year and I'm gonna I've got it

816
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,110
paused right now but just orient

817
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:47,120
yourself so here's Canada there's Alaska

818
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:50,820
right there and then here's Siberia and

819
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:53,100
notice how close the ice is to the

820
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,440
margins of these continents okay and

821
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,110
this is these images you're going to see

822
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,540
is during is is the extent of the ice in

823
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,330
the summer okay so in the winter it

824
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,210
pretty much always reaches out to the

825
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:09,990
extent of the of the boundaries here

826
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:13,500
okay so let me let me play this so year

827
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:17,580
two here notice how the margins of the

828
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:19,740
ice change and some years are colder and

829
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,960
there's more ice some years are warmer

830
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:26,130
there's less ice but we're looking for

831
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,790
the overall trend and notice that in

832
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:33,570
some summers the ice actually doesn't

833
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:36,480
even reach the land masses in some

834
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:39,270
instances which meaning which means it

835
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,630
opens up the Seaway dad didn't used to

836
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:45,360
be there okay now this is a little

837
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,349
obsolete ends in 2011 since this was

838
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,839
made

839
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,699
the sea ice is actually decreased even

840
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,459
more now we're going to look at the same

841
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:56,189
data except we're also superimposing a

842
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:57,779
time series graph and this is again to

843
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:59,579
illustrate the point that I keep trying

844
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:01,459
to make which is that climate change is

845
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:04,979
not something we observe year-to-year

846
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:07,739
it's a long term trend and so even

847
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:09,569
though we can see that you know some

848
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:12,209
years there is more ice in some years

849
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:14,099
there's less the overall trend is one of

850
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:16,049
going downhill and that's what they're

851
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:18,179
showing here on this plot that they

852
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:21,619
superimposed on the same movie that we

853
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:21,619
just saw okay

854
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,480
so along with that is the fact that

855
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,770
we're seeing a lot more melting of

856
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,380
continental glaciers than we saw

857
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:35,500
previously and so Greenland is one of

858
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,550
the examples where you know Greenland is

859
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,790
one of these places that we've been

860
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,280
drilling ice cores because it has not

861
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,410
melted for hundreds of thousands of

862
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,810
years and yet now we're seeing sort of

863
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,730
record amounts of Greenland starting to

864
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,520
melt and it makes for some very

865
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:53,830
spectacular photos like this waterfall

866
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,610
here but that's not supposed to be

867
00:38:53,830 --> 00:39:00,100
happening and you know it's it's kind of

868
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,410
a shocking amount of ice that's been

869
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:06,300
melting so here's just a three-year

870
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:09,460
study from 2004 to 2007 Greenland lost

871
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,840
amount of ice equivalent to 14 States of

872
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,660
course they picked little States but

873
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,520
still each of these 3 feet thick you

874
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,190
know that's a significant amount of ice

875
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,690
that that it lost now there's still a

876
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,970
lot there so it's not going to be

877
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,100
disappearing you know even in a few

878
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,680
years it's going to take a while but

879
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:30,130
we're seeing record amount of ice melt

880
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,130
coming off of Greenland in the springs

881
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,020
and summers so here's a Renu's report

882
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,330
from a couple years ago scientists

883
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:41,500
incredulous at normally high numbers for

884
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:44,980
April record melting across 12% of the

885
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:49,000
ice sheet so that's more than they'd

886
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:52,030
ever seen before this time of year also

887
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,950
we can look at glaciers and we can we

888
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,230
can we can look at where the glaciers

889
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,660
were about a hundred years ago so I've

890
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,950
got some before-and-after images and

891
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,720
again if you if you watch media popular

892
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,720
media programs on climate change they'll

893
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,340
kind of frame this as scientists look at

894
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,260
this and we can tell that global warming

895
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,390
is happening because of this I want to

896
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,280
emphasize that this is one of the

897
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,890
effects of global warming but but this

898
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,860
is not great data for scientists this is

899
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:23,740
one of the effects so here we are a

900
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,690
glacier so before and after picture 100

901
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,610
years apart you can see the glacier in

902
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,740
the foreground and nothing left but a

903
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:32,320
little patch of snow in the background

904
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:35,620
on on the modern picture here's another

905
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,620
one from 1920 again you can see the

906
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:39,200
glacier here

907
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:43,070
and this little ice field about a

908
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,620
hundred years later this glacier here it

909
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:49,520
isn't in the background no sign of it

910
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:52,250
anymore or this one which is now way

911
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,320
back there and you can see these you

912
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,790
know pictures from like this all over

913
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,220
the place where there where there are

914
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:59,540
glaciers that there's if you look a

915
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,490
hundred years ago you see this big

916
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,640
difference right so here's Olympic

917
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,640
National Park that before I'm sorry the

918
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,530
before and the after right or this one

919
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,820
the before and there it is way in the

920
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:15,560
background the after this is a little

921
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,040
bit of a confined of a confusing image

922
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:22,250
we're looking down from space this is

923
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,810
the top that glacier flow downhill this

924
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:29,270
way and this is it melting and chunks of

925
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:31,460
ice are floating in the water here so

926
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,260
these lines are what we call the old

927
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,840
terminus this is where the glacier used

928
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,910
to be so in the 1851 this is where the

929
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:41,270
glacier ended this was the terminus and

930
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:44,840
then as you you know 1902 this is the

931
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,940
terminus headed uphill 2000s it's up

932
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,760
here the last mark on there is actually

933
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:52,580
over ten years old now it's 2006 and

934
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,820
they need to update this image but the

935
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:59,690
glacier is now somewhere back here so

936
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:03,280
it's been retreating every year more or

937
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:06,770
less as as a climate has gotten warmer

938
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,600
other evidence that the for our warmer

939
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,810
temperatures is that the sea level is

940
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:14,900
rising okay now our records of sea level

941
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:16,820
get more more sketchy the further back

942
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,850
we go so you'll see there's several

943
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:23,150
lines here so this is year 1900 this is

944
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:24,470
millimeters above they picked a 30-year

945
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,390
average again they didn't tell us where

946
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,830
it was but there's a 30-year average

947
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,200
that they're comparing this to and

948
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,970
they're comparing how much global sea

949
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,580
average has changed some particular

950
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:36,080
thirty year period and there's different

951
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,150
lines because they've been measuring

952
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,380
different different ways if there's

953
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,720
different techniques for trying to

954
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,580
figure out the global sea level and then

955
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,080
suddenly you see the lines get thinner

956
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,700
and that's because we start measuring

957
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,120
them from satellites and it becomes a

958
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,370
lot more accurate now your book talked

959
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,600
about

960
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,910
this a little bit but just to make sure

961
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,870
you didn't miss it there's two reasons

962
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:59,160
why the oceans are rising number one is

963
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,410
the one that everybody probably can

964
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,540
guess if you melt ice that ice goes into

965
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,060
the sea and the sea level rises right

966
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,550
you melt glaciers sea level goes up but

967
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,890
that's actually the smaller component

968
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,650
the more significant reason is because

969
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,660
when you warm up water it actually

970
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,690
expands a little bit so as the oceans

971
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,960
get warmer the entire oceans in all of

972
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,700
it is starting to expand just from

973
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,880
warmer temperatures so those two things

974
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:30,150
together are why the oceans are rising

975
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,400
now once we got satellites that could

976
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,110
measure the ocean from basically it's

977
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,850
like using radar where they beam down

978
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,860
then they hit the ocean they bounce back

979
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,990
and they can measure it pretty precisely

980
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:42,360
we got satellites that can do that

981
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:45,270
starting in the early 90s and what you

982
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:48,060
can see the dark blue is kind of up and

983
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:51,150
down changes year to year of the sea

984
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:53,610
levels but if you the red line is sort

985
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,980
of the trend line the overall trend and

986
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:58,230
the overall trend is that the seas have

987
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,870
been increasing it about three point

988
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,160
four millimeters per year okay so that's

989
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,170
not huge right three point four

990
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,610
millimeters that's not a lot but it's

991
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:10,920
starting to add up over the decades and

992
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,960
especially is becoming noticeable if you

993
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,110
live pretty close to sea level so this

994
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,200
is not a hurricane or anything weird

995
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,120
this is just a high tide the town in

996
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,340
Florida that's built pretty close to sea

997
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,840
level and we can see that now the ocean

998
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,000
is starting to come in where it didn't

999
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,540
used to come before in fact there are

1000
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,520
these cities along Florida where places

1001
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,230
that didn't hardly ever used to flood

1002
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:36,570
except in rare events are starting to

1003
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,280
flood on a regular occurrence now then

1004
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,110
water's coming up in the storm drains

1005
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,270
and you know it's not coming from the

1006
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,790
ocean it's coming up the storm drains in

1007
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:48,150
flooding the streets now because those

1008
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:51,890
areas are now starting to become below

1009
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:54,360
sea level when they didn't used to be

1010
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:57,180
another way that you can see this is

1011
00:44:54,360 --> 00:45:00,390
again just another example from from

1012
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:02,820
Virginia and Norfolk so this is along

1013
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,970
the coast and they this is kind of a

1014
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,910
weird graph it's our

1015
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:09,400
per year of flooding in this particular

1016
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:10,990
neighborhood so somehow or another I

1017
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,910
don't know who thought of this but they

1018
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:15,520
started recording how many hours per

1019
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:18,670
year this particular neighborhood was

1020
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,890
under flooding and so back in the 30s is

1021
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,859
when they started this and you can see

1022
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:25,780
that as time has gone on they see more

1023
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:28,420
and more hours of flooding in this

1024
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:30,070
neighborhood again this is not great

1025
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,690
data for scientists because there could

1026
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:34,180
be other things that contribute to

1027
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,410
flooding in the neighborhood how you you

1028
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,140
know how the streets are being

1029
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,400
maintained and how the storm sewers are

1030
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,260
being maintained and all that kind of

1031
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,380
stuff but it's just another illustration

1032
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:48,790
of how rising sea levels are affecting

1033
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:50,920
some neighborhoods so to conclude we've

1034
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:53,349
got evidence that the temperatures are

1035
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,260
increasing in the summers in the winters

1036
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:58,540
and the days and the nights especially

1037
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,750
during the nights especially during the

1038
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,220
winters we see it over the continents

1039
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:05,710
especially we see where the oceans some

1040
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:08,859
we see it up in the atmosphere we've

1041
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:10,570
talked about all those things also what

1042
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:12,250
we've seen in the previous lecture is

1043
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,230
that greenhouse gases are higher now

1044
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,599
than they've been in the past million

1045
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:19,180
years or so probably more but we can say

1046
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:20,410
for sure in the past million so we know

1047
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,250
the temperatures are higher than they've

1048
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,320
been in a long time

1049
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:25,630
we know that greenhouse gases are higher

1050
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,670
than they've been in a long time we know

1051
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:30,520
how greenhouse gases work so the

1052
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,800
question is are can we say a hundred

1053
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,980
percent sure that the extra greenhouse

1054
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,869
gases are changing the climate or could

1055
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:42,849
there be some other factor at work so

1056
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:45,609
what is another way that Mother Nature

1057
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:47,589
could possibly change the climate how

1058
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:49,390
could we make the earth warmer it if

1059
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:51,730
it's not humans producing greenhouse

1060
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:54,510
gases what else could it possibly be

1061
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:59,140
well one thing it could possibly be are

1062
00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:03,369
sunspots so the Sun turns out is not at

1063
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:06,849
a constant luminosity it goes through

1064
00:47:03,369 --> 00:47:08,980
these 11-year cycles of sunspots and the

1065
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:11,710
Sun has these magnetic storms and

1066
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,690
they're not very well understood but

1067
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:16,810
what we do know is that the Sun has

1068
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,800
these cycles of eleven years where it

1069
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,960
goes through periods of

1070
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,810
or sunspots and then periods of less

1071
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:25,630
sunspots now here is what is

1072
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:28,570
counterintuitive when you have a sunspot

1073
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,430
the sunspot is dark because it's cooler

1074
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,490
than the surrounding area

1075
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:36,550
and you'd think okay if the Sun has more

1076
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:38,620
sunspots it should be cooler but it

1077
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,740
turns out that when there are sunspots

1078
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:44,740
the area surrounding the sunspot is

1079
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:47,650
actually extra hot and makes up for the

1080
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:50,500
sunspot and more than makes up for it so

1081
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,900
when you have a Sun with more sunspots

1082
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,320
the Sun is actually hotter by a few

1083
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,970
degrees and it's not huge but it's

1084
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,810
enough to make a difference of the

1085
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:03,400
climate on earth so more sunspots means

1086
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,780
a hotter Sun and again that's

1087
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,720
counterintuitive you'd probably think

1088
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,850
that more sunspots would be a cooler Sun

1089
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,490
so people have been noticing counting

1090
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:16,300
sunspots ever since the telescope was

1091
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:18,310
invented and so here's an example of a

1092
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,860
peak where there's a peak in the 11-year

1093
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:23,020
cycle and then a decrease in that

1094
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:26,740
11-year cycle then the peak 11 years

1095
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:28,750
later and so forth so every 11 years we

1096
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:34,060
have a peak in the sunspot cycle and

1097
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:37,660
then ago they decrease again so here is

1098
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:39,910
a movie of sunspots and before I start

1099
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:42,340
it notice they've got yellow and they've

1100
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,650
got blue here and sunspots have a north

1101
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,150
and a south so they're magnetic and so

1102
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,950
that's what the two colors mean and

1103
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,280
we're going to look at a quick movie

1104
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:53,620
time-lapse of several years of sunspots

1105
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,020
so it's going to rotate at first to show

1106
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,660
you here's the an active Sun with a lot

1107
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:01,270
of sunspots and then it's going to kind

1108
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:05,770
of split it apart so you can see the

1109
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:17,650
whole Sun is a big map and then it's

1110
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:21,520
going to play ok Dec 3 2013 7 years

1111
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:25,000
later and then they disappear there's

1112
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:28,210
that here comes the next cycle so every

1113
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,370
11 years we see this maximum and then

1114
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,430
back down to minimum again that's the

1115
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:33,470
sunspot cycle

1116
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,869
and each time it does that the Sun is a

1117
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:39,349
little bit warmer during the maximum a

1118
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:41,480
little bit cooler during the minimum so

1119
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:43,099
one of the things that Galileo did as

1120
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,859
soon as even into telescope is he

1121
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:47,809
started observing sunspots so we've got

1122
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:50,839
an actual record of sunspots all the way

1123
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:53,720
back to about 1610 is when he started

1124
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:56,240
doing this and one of the weird things

1125
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,630
that happened in the late 1600s is the

1126
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,579
sunspots went almost disappeared

1127
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,069
completely for several decades like half

1128
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:06,109
a century it's called the maunder

1129
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:08,119
minimum and for whatever reason the Sun

1130
00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:10,490
went into kind of a relatively low

1131
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:12,559
activity state and we had very few

1132
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:17,710
sunspots decade after decade

1133
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:20,510
well that period of low sunspot activity

1134
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:22,460
corresponds to something that we call

1135
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,589
the Little Ice Age and it was a period

1136
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,940
where the earth was actually a little

1137
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:28,309
bit cooler than usual

1138
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,859
not full-on Ice Age with like glaciers

1139
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:33,170
coming down and all that but if you look

1140
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:35,240
at the historical records farmers had a

1141
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,520
hard time during the Little Ice Age a

1142
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,589
lot of crops failed because the earth

1143
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,990
was relatively cooler than it was

1144
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:43,520
supposed to be and then we also see

1145
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:47,329
there some other times say in the early

1146
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,490
1800s where the sunspot number was a lot

1147
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:53,390
lower than it was supposed to be and and

1148
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:55,339
there was a measurable cooler earth just

1149
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:58,250
by maybe half a degree or something like

1150
00:50:55,339 --> 00:51:01,220
that but it makes a difference well so

1151
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,619
some critics of modern day global

1152
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,480
warming science will say that Oh the

1153
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:07,849
reason the earth is getting warmer today

1154
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:11,569
is because of sunspots okay so let's

1155
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:16,849
look at that so we count sunspots today

1156
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:21,020
and this curve followed by this curve or

1157
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:22,970
the last two solar cycles so the so this

1158
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,160
is the last solar cycle and this is the

1159
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:28,760
one before that so the one before that

1160
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:31,160
peaked in about 2000 2001 and the black

1161
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,890
dots are how many solar how many

1162
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,930
sunspots are being counted and the blue

1163
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:38,990
is like a running mean so they're using

1164
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:41,119
the same math that we did earlier so you

1165
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:44,510
can see okay it looks like the the

1166
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,080
sunspot cycle back in 2000 2001 peak

1167
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,360
that

1168
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:50,840
you know whatever 125 whether whatever

1169
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:53,150
this level is here here's so then the

1170
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,980
the sunspots decrease right so that's

1171
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,230
this part and then they ramp up again

1172
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:01,700
and it's supposed to peak 11 years after

1173
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:04,400
this but but instead of peaking up here

1174
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:07,460
like the previous one it's peaking down

1175
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:11,180
here and so we have actually had a

1176
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:14,060
relatively inactive sunspot cycle in the

1177
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,130
past you know this passing spots cycle

1178
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,470
it's supposed to be up here we had fewer

1179
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,840
sunspots and we're supposed to so the

1180
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:23,120
Sun is actually cooler than it's

1181
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,250
supposed to be so the argument that

1182
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,920
sunspots are somehow making the climate

1183
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:29,690
warmer are exactly backwards the amount

1184
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,420
of sunspots we have is lower than it

1185
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,580
should be so if the sunspots were back

1186
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,710
up where they ought to be we ought to

1187
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,860
see it climate it's even warmer than we

1188
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,960
have today so another thing you will

1189
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,040
hear from climate change deniers and

1190
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,680
these are the people who think that

1191
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,620
there either is no climate change or if

1192
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,140
it is it's naturally occurring they will

1193
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:54,290
say that volcanic eruptions are what's

1194
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,340
behind climate change and usually what

1195
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,650
they say is the amount of greenhouse

1196
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:00,580
gases coming out of the volcano is

1197
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:03,560
greater than that of produced by humans

1198
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,240
now one reason you already know why

1199
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,950
that's not true is because when we

1200
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,230
looked at the Keeling curve remember

1201
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:12,500
that that's the curve of co2 going up

1202
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:15,290
and up and up a little bit each year if

1203
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,150
the amount of greenhouse gases coming

1204
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,710
out of volcanoes was significant then

1205
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:20,690
you would see a big jump every time

1206
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,940
there was a volcanic eruption but you

1207
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:25,040
never see that and in fact all the co2

1208
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,200
sensors around the world that monitor

1209
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,730
how much co2 is in the atmosphere they

1210
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,530
don't do anything when you have a big

1211
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:33,440
volcanic eruption it's just not enough

1212
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:36,380
co2 so that's not the reason but there

1213
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,960
is a reason that volcanoes can change

1214
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,660
the climate if you have a big volcanic

1215
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,900
eruption and this is the last really big

1216
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:48,620
one sort of in our lifetime was Pinatubo

1217
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:50,420
in the Philippines in 1991 this big

1218
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,070
cloud you see is something called

1219
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,830
volcanic ash and it's a little tiny

1220
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:57,740
microscopic pieces of rock and it's

1221
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,740
mostly glass and if it's a really big

1222
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,990
eruption

1223
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,970
material will get ejected up into the

1224
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:05,400
stratosphere and when it gets up into

1225
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:09,180
the stratosphere as we learn in the way

1226
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:13,080
early lecture there is no whether to

1227
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:14,250
remove ash from the stratosphere or

1228
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,510
anything from there's no weather up

1229
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:18,810
there there's no causes no precipitation

1230
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:20,100
and so it goes up and it spreads out and

1231
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:22,520
one of the things that it does is it

1232
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:25,830
blocks sunlight and it cools the planet

1233
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:31,230
so for example here's a little

1234
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:33,270
time-lapse movie of a poignant style

1235
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:35,010
eruption and so this is the ash coming

1236
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,560
up and you might see some lightning in

1237
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:40,680
there too this looks like the anvil from

1238
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,510
a cumulonimbus and this marks the top of

1239
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,090
the stratosphere or the I'm sorry the

1240
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:47,400
top of the tropopause in the beginning

1241
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:50,310
of the stratosphere and you can see once

1242
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,650
of all you'll see some some ash punching

1243
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:55,950
through and going up into the

1244
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:58,320
stratosphere and so that Ash once it

1245
00:54:55,950 --> 00:55:00,450
goes up into the stratosphere will stay

1246
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,980
up usually like a couple of years before

1247
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,869
it finally gets removed see right there

1248
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,540
you can see it going up into the

1249
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:08,220
stratosphere so this will have a change

1250
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:13,230
in the climate but it has a cooling

1251
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:14,609
effect not a warming effect so we have

1252
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,040
instruments that actually measure how

1253
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:19,230
much dust is in the stratosphere and

1254
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,210
this is the readout from one of these

1255
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:25,859
and let's see if we can make sense of

1256
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:28,260
this so what we're looking at is a graph

1257
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:29,430
let's ignore the color one for now and

1258
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,460
we're looking at this black and white

1259
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:36,000
graph this is how much dust is in the

1260
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:38,850
stratosphere as the years go by so this

1261
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,800
is 1985 moving forward and we see

1262
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:43,170
there's a big spike right here in the

1263
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,230
amount of dust in stratosphere that's

1264
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,910
Mount Pinatubo and then it decreases and

1265
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,510
takes several years for it to come back

1266
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,910
to normal

1267
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:53,780
well during this time in here after

1268
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:55,980
Pinatubo erupted we saw that the world

1269
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,390
global temperature decreased about at

1270
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,270
one degree or one and a half degrees

1271
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,310
centigrade so it actually changed the

1272
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:04,170
climate and you can see these little

1273
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:06,780
bumps here these are smaller volcanic

1274
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:10,650
eruptions that also had put ash into the

1275
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:12,390
stratosphere but at a lesser amount if

1276
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,650
you go back in time

1277
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,349
you can see that we've actually had some

1278
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:18,630
volcanoes much larger than Pinatubo

1279
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:21,210
every one of these little spikes here

1280
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,529
has been a big eruption kind of like the

1281
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:25,140
one we just saw in that movie except

1282
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:26,430
bigger and there has you know for you

1283
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,289
know this goes way back hundreds of

1284
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:30,180
years but for the periods of time that

1285
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:31,980
we actually have written records what we

1286
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:34,529
see is that every time there was a

1287
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:38,069
really big eruption like Krakatoa there

1288
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:40,829
was actually a recorded cooing event

1289
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:42,839
afterwards a lot a crop failure you know

1290
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:44,130
in modern times where we actually had

1291
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,589
temperature measurements we can measure

1292
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:49,500
that we had a cooler summer that

1293
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:53,160
followed so everyone in these big ones

1294
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:55,289
probably resulted in a in a dip in the

1295
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:58,230
Earth's temperatures for a year or two

1296
00:56:55,289 --> 00:57:00,660
following that eruption so if we take

1297
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:02,130
all the sunspot records into account and

1298
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:05,099
we take all the volcanic eruption

1299
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:06,809
records into account we can reconstruct

1300
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:08,970
the climate of the earth in the past

1301
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:12,450
several hundred years and what we see is

1302
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:15,299
that we can explain pretty much all of

1303
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:17,940
the changes in Earth's climate over the

1304
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:20,490
past several hundred years except for

1305
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,960
what's happened in the past hundred the

1306
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:24,750
warming that we're seeing in the past

1307
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:28,049
hundred years cannot be explained with

1308
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:30,029
volcanoes or sunspots and we're left

1309
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:34,819
with really the only thing remaining

1310
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:34,819
which is human greenhouse gases
