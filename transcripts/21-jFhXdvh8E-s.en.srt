1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,620
hey this is Mel and in this lecture

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,490
we're gonna be talking about how we

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,929
generate electricity with fossil fuels

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,330
so in the previous unit we've been

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,800
talking about greenhouse gases and one

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,320
of the things that we said is it we

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,480
actually burn more fossil fuels to

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,560
generate electricity than we do for

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,800
anything else even transportation so the

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,020
number one source of co2 emissions in

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,750
the world is for generating electricity

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,629
we're going to explore how that's done

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,360
okay so to start with we're going to

14
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,219
talk about how electricity is generated

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,500
and in general you need three things to

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,070
generate electricity you need a

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,899
conductor which is usually a metal you

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,250
need a magnetic field and you need

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:00,180
motion so let's talk about these what is

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,030
a conductor a conductor is usually

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,570
copper but it doesn't have to be but

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:13,350
it's a metal so imagine a wire right so

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:15,180
I've got this copper wire here and when

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,970
we when we talk about electricity what

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,810
we really mean is we've got the flow of

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:26,400
electrons going down a wire okay

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:30,810
so to get that to happen if I take a

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,960
magnet so remember a magnet has a north

29
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,740
cell north side in the south side and

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,560
let's say I move this magnet back and

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,450
forth what I would if I move this magnet

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,130
back and forth what I would notice is

33
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:52,619
that the little electrons would start

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:54,810
moving down the wire okay and if I move

35
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,170
this back and forth the electrons will

36
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,420
change direction back and forth as well

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:04,920
so the conductor is a metal that allows

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,409
the electrons to flow and the motion of

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,640
the magnet is what forces the electrons

40
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,760
to move both those things together will

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,989
generate electricity

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:23,140
so if I say wanted to power let's say a

43
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:27,069
light bulb then I would hook this say to

44
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,290
the light bulb okay and as I move this

45
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,290
back and forth the electrons would

46
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,190
actually move down the wire through the

47
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:40,569
light and they would continue going on a

48
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:43,599
loop and the light would light up right

49
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:49,299
so that's electricity so a simple

50
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:52,950
demonstration is so you may have seen

51
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:55,720
something like this that this is a

52
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,980
hand-crank generator and inside there

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,010
there's a little you see that little

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:06,400
metal cylinder that's got magnet in

55
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:16,599
there and when I spin the handle okay

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:18,280
the light lights up okay okay so you

57
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,470
need three things to generate

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,889
electricity magnetic field the conductor

59
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,919
and in motion so the wires or the

60
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:29,410
conductor a physical magnet or maybe a

61
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,780
coil wire is the magnetic field but you

62
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,389
need something to move it and the thing

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,269
that moves it is usually something

64
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,930
called a steam turbine so a steam

65
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:45,510
turbine looks like a giant fan and these

66
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:49,209
the steam turbines sit inside this

67
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,489
housing and steam comes in these holes

68
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,489
and pushes against the the blades of

69
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,829
this turbine and this whole thing spins

70
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,840
around and around and around and on the

71
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,459
other end it's gonna connect to

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,250
something that's producing a magnetic

73
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,310
field that will then spin in the same

74
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:10,030
way that I just spun that little one so

75
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,680
steam turbines can be gigantic and the

76
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,280
reason they have multiple blades as so

77
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,440
as the steam goes through them it it's

78
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,030
the max it's the most efficient way of

79
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,130
trying to capture all the energy from

80
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,950
the steam is they have multiple fan

81
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,270
blades so on in short what happens to

82
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,000
steam comes in

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,610
and turns the the blades of the turbine

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,770
which then turn a giant version of the

85
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,379
thing I was just holding and that is

86
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,090
what generates electricity so this is

87
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,310
what one looks like in an actual power

88
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,470
plant everything's covered so you don't

89
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,319
there's not much to see but the steam

90
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,659
comes in here there's the the fan blades

91
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,009
would be in here the turbine and it's

92
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:49,990
spinning this thing which has the

93
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,879
magnetic field and it's generating the

94
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,479
electricity that's the generator here's

95
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,340
another one

96
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,349
steam comes in there here's the

97
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:01,419
generator and in a big big power plant

98
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:03,220
they'll have several of these so here

99
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,680
they've got several steam turbines and

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,150
then turning generators here okay so

101
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,979
there everything's covered there's not a

102
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,409
whole lot to see if you're actually to

103
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:13,509
go inside a power plant but in order to

104
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:15,039
do this you got to make steam in order

105
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,229
to make steam you got to boil water in

106
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,210
order to boil water you need a source of

107
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,379
heat okay so what are some of the things

108
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,940
that we could actually burn well purpose

109
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:26,530
of this lecture is to talk about fossil

110
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,430
fuels so that's probably where we're in

111
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,050
the start this this is a graph that's

112
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,940
talking about co2 emissions from

113
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,020
different sectors and I just want to

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,530
focus on this one right here it says

115
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,949
electricity generation so by burning

116
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,349
fossil fuels we can boil water and this

117
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:48,490
breaks it down into which fossil fuel we

118
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:51,520
burn the most and this color right here

119
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,639
is coal so that's number one number two

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,210
is natural gas that's thread and then

121
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,279
just a little bit of petroleum so we in

122
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,449
general in this country do not burn oil

123
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,810
to make electricity

124
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:08,229
we typically burn coal number one and

125
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,279
number two we burn natural gas now in

126
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,380
New Mexico

127
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,840
what's kind of a crappy graphic but it's

128
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,759
only one I got about three-quarters of

129
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,979
all the electricity in New Mexico is

130
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,539
from burning coal and almost all the

131
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:21,000
rest is from natural gas and we're

132
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,349
starting to see a little bit of

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,729
renewables since this slide was made in

134
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,819
2009 since then

135
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:30,250
renewables has gone up a little bit but

136
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,770
it's still pretty low so let's talk

137
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,810
about coal so what is coal well coal

138
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,610
figure to look at kind of as a black

139
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:42,389
shiny looking Rock and it starts with

140
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,280
womp so in a swamp you if you kind of

141
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,939
think back to our lecture on dams and

142
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,409
how we said the bottom of a reservoir

143
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,240
gamma reverie and you make a artificial

144
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,430
lake at the bottom you have very little

145
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,439
oxygen right well this is happening

146
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:00,000
naturally in a swamp so this water down

147
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:02,069
here is very stagnant and and near the

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,800
bottom there's very little oxygen so as

149
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:06,900
material plant leaves whatever they fall

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,210
down they land in the water they sink to

151
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,389
the bottom they actually get preserved

152
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,849
because there's no oxygen down there to

153
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,740
promote decay and so the organic

154
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:18,930
material builds up and builds up as long

155
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,539
as these swamps stay in existence

156
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,090
eventually the swamp the material from

157
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:28,610
the swamps is buried and we would call

158
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:31,080
that peat so you can go to say nursery

159
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,449
or Home Depot wherever you can buy bags

160
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,819
of peat and it looks like kind of old

161
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,400
crappy looking leaves and you put in

162
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:42,750
your garden as fertilizer but eventually

163
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,479
if over geologic time those that peat

164
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,520
will become buried as weak as it becomes

165
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,039
buried it's good it gets subjected to

166
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,589
pressure and heat and there's this

167
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,469
metamorphism that happens where that

168
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:57,449
what looks like old dead leaves turns

169
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:01,800
into this black shiny rock and then we

170
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:03,419
call it coal and high-quality coal has

171
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,069
been has been buried

172
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,020
you know maybe miles below the surface

173
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,479
and subjected to really high

174
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,000
temperatures for maybe over millions of

175
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,009
years so it's it's seen a lot of heat

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,620
and pressure by the time we pull it back

177
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,319
out of the ground but it used to be for

178
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,939
the most part dead plant matter so this

179
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,430
is what a coal seam looks like so you

180
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,610
can imagine this all used to be the

181
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,860
bottom of a swamp long buried subjected

182
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,070
to heat and pressure transformed into

183
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,870
this coal and in order to get to the

184
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,510
coal if I just go back you know you've

185
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,390
got to dig this rock away to get to the

186
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,070
coal down here and sometimes it's that's

187
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,440
really easy like these guys there's just

188
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,329
right below the surface but often it's

189
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
not very close to the surface and you

190
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:50,069
gotta go way down to get it there's a

191
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,570
couple ways we do that one is called

192
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,540
mountaintop removal

193
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,910
and everything you see in this in this

194
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,370
picture is coal you can see all the

195
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,579
black out here and this used to be a

196
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,320
mountain and they started at the top and

197
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:07,139
they started to remove all the stuff

198
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,209
that was not coal to get down to the

199
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:13,079
coal and that's what they're doing here

200
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:16,370
so it's a big operation requires big

201
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:19,970
equipment big trucks big shovels and

202
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,829
they have to remove a lot of material

203
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,569
for this to be profitable so here's a

204
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,310
mountaintop removal the pictures I'm

205
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:29,069
showing you here are mostly from the

206
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,470
east east half of the country so

207
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:33,630
Appalachian region a lot of this so this

208
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,880
was a mountain with trees on it and they

209
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:39,990
have started at the top and worked their

210
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,160
way down well if you if you do this you

211
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,839
there's a lot of environmental

212
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,790
destruction that's going on as a result

213
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,970
of mountaintop removal a lot of the

214
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,740
material ends up in the rivers you're

215
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,399
wiping out all of the vegetation that

216
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,930
was on top and just from a human

217
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,880
perspective I mean it's a pretty ugly

218
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,420
thing to look at but you can see in this

219
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,240
picture the black is the coal and the

220
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,160
the beige is not coal but they got to

221
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,510
take it all down anyway whether it's

222
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,459
coal or not because they got to remove

223
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,889
the stuff that don't want to get down to

224
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,750
this stuff that they do want so again

225
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,910
all these pictures mountaintop removal

226
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,130
okay so it's a pretty a pretty

227
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,600
environmentally destructive way to

228
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:24,060
remove coal now the other way of doing

229
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,069
it is underground mines so an

230
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,130
underground mine is you did coals

231
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:31,350
underground so you drill a hole down get

232
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,410
a tunnel going and this is really

233
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:37,769
difficult dangerous work you follow that

234
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,089
coal seam and so environmentally it's

235
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,560
actually better for the environment

236
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,300
because you're not taking down a whole

237
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,660
mountain to get to it you're just making

238
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:49,009
a hole going down there from a workman's

239
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,069
perspective it is a very dangerous job

240
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,689
there's coal dust dangerous equipment

241
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:57,389
gases coming out and by the way

242
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,829
everything you're mining is flammable so

243
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:05,520
the accidents happen and coal fires

244
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:08,480
happen and occasionally we get some

245
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,850
disaster so here's one from 2010 where

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,510
25 people in West revenge vert West

247
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,010
Virginia died when there is an explosion

248
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:22,080
so there's a methane gas buildup and

249
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:25,230
they ignited and we don't have this so

250
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,000
we have decent amount of safety rules in

251
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,650
this country but if you look at some

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,450
other countries like China and they was

253
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,030
you know usually a couple hundred people

254
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,920
a year mining coal it's a bit

255
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,870
underground it's a very dangerous job

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,240
and like I said everything you're mining

257
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,040
is flammable so why are we burning coal

258
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,680
in the first place well we just have a

259
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,870
lot of it and as an accident a geologic

260
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,890
history that the United States has a lot

261
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:52,230
of coal the reason is is for millions of

262
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:55,140
years we were actually situated in a

263
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,930
place where swamps were very common

264
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,100
widespread over most of the country so

265
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,800
if you ever seen pictures of the

266
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,420
Everglades today you can imagine that

267
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,270
type of environment all across the

268
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,130
United States and so all these places

269
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,640
that are blue are places where we see a

270
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,890
lot of coal deposits because in geologic

271
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,350
time there was just extensive swamps for

272
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,900
they they existed for millions of years

273
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:22,260
you'll notice that one of those places

274
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,840
happens to be in Northwest New Mexico

275
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,990
ok so we have a pretty good coal deposit

276
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,330
up in here and consequently we have coal

277
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,980
mines in that area and coal-fired power

278
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,030
plants so one of the biggest ones we

279
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,460
have is called the San Juan generating

280
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:38,480
station there's actually several near

281
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:42,000
the Four Corners area you can see here

282
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,190
pile of coal here we've got a conveyor

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,620
belt system that takes the coal up into

284
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:50,220
the power plant so a power plant like

285
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,410
this you see there's four chimneys right

286
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:57,060
that means there's four furnaces that

287
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:59,100
feed four turbines okay so here we can

288
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,280
see three of them this white that's

289
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,620
coming out is water vapor and a long

290
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,810
time ago we talked about how when you

291
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,310
burn hydrocarbons water vapor as a

292
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,040
byproduct

293
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,890
so then back then we were talking about

294
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,720
it in terms of what makes a cloud so I

295
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,760
actually used a coal-fired power plant

296
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,230
as an example back then so what's coming

297
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
out here is

298
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,970
water vapor that's condensing making a

299
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,650
cloud from burning of the coal now

300
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,150
remember the whole reason we're talking

301
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,100
about this is because of greenhouse

302
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,820
gases and as we're burning coal or

303
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,530
producing a lot of carbon dioxide and a

304
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,080
little bit of meal a few other things as

305
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,180
well but you can't see that right you

306
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,220
cannot see the mercury that if there is

307
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,650
any that's coming out you can't see the

308
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,640
NOx all you can really see is the water

309
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:51,750
vapor but near the Four Corners area

310
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,820
we've got several large generating

311
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,850
stations cold fire power plants because

312
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,930
coal is so plentiful there so here's a

313
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,190
coal mine near Farmington for example

314
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,290
here's another one their Page Arizona

315
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,630
you can see it's got three chimneys

316
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,210
therefore it has three furnaces with

317
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,070
three steam turbines

318
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:16,980
there's the coal piled up right here

319
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:20,430
ready to go another picture of it here's

320
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,320
what a here's a pile of coal that's

321
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,870
getting ready to load it up into a

322
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,970
coal-fired power plant so that in this

323
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,490
case the barges are bringing it down

324
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:33,360
they dump in this pile and they comes up

325
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:36,690
the conveyor belt and the amount of coal

326
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,090
that is burned and each coal-fired power

327
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:42,450
plant is kind of staggering so this is a

328
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,970
coal train and it's just a train full of

329
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,400
coal and generally they can be about a

330
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,140
mile long or so and a really big

331
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,540
coal-fired power plant like the one we

332
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,330
have in the four corners can burn

333
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,820
through three to five trains of coal per

334
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,950
day so that gives you some kind of

335
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,570
amount you know it's a staggering amount

336
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,970
of coal that we're bringing through

337
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,660
every single day just to keep generating

338
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,640
electricity so we're gonna watch a

339
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,410
little video here that was put together

340
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,990
by a coal-fired power plant company that

341
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,980
explains very well how it works and

342
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,260
they're going to go through the steps

343
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,570
from the coal going into the into the

344
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:25,140
power plant until electricity is

345
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:28,770
generated and it's it's very well done

346
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,410
it's animated one of the things I want

347
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,850
you to pay attention to is they're going

348
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,199
to talk about several technology

349
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:39,139
geez that they use to clean the exhaust

350
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,290
so in other words as they burn the coal

351
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:44,759
and exhaust goes up the chimney they

352
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,410
have to clean that before it goes into

353
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,220
the air and they'll talk about several

354
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:53,069
things that happen to clean that and I

355
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,899
just want to point out that the culpa

356
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,110
the coal-fired power plants in this

357
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:02,250
country are required to do those things

358
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:04,319
from our Clean Air Act so so in the past

359
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,250
we talked about air pollution we talked

360
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:11,370
about we have these regulations for for

361
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,980
air air pollution and other countries

362
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,600
don't necessarily have those right so

363
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,880
the technologies are talking about in

364
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,339
this video are not the same technologies

365
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,529
that you may find say in a in a power

366
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,660

553
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,570
is our responsibility to provide our

554
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:48,539
customers with reliable affordable and

555
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:51,570
clean energy for their needs and we take

556
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:54,220
that very seriously we hope you enjoyed

557
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,400
this virtual tour of plant Miller

558
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,400
[Music]

559
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,530
so one problem that coal-fired power

560
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,840
plants

561
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:06,890
still have is they don't know what to do

562
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,140
with all of the ash that's left over

563
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,750
when they're done burning the coal so in

564
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,670
that video they talked about fly ash so

565
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,190
ash is just you know if you had a

566
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,260
fireplace and you burn some wood you got

567
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,920
leftover ash in the bottom when you're

568
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,360
done right

569
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,920
and so there's technology in that

570
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,080
coal-fired power plant to keep the ash

571
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,090
from flying out the chimney that's what

572
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,070
they call fly ash and flies out right

573
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,290
but there's ash left in the bottom and

574
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,570
they have to do something with it and if

575
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,660
they're burning you know multiple trains

576
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:39,180
full of coal a day they're generating a

577
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,630
lot of ash so in this picture here you

578
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:45,060
can see it looks like this muddy area

579
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:48,870
this is coal ash and they have to keep

580
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:51,480
it wet so it doesn't blow away and they

581
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,420
actually don't really know what to do

582
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:58,770
with it so this big area right out in

583
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:00,510
here is a pond and so they you know they

584
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,240
take a shot of the furnace they dump it

585
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:07,320
into this big pond where it stays wet

586
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,990
eventually settles down and here's an

587
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,160
here's an example of one of these ash

588
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,930
reservoirs so they're dumping ash into

589
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,390
this water you can kind of see there's

590
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:18,270
an outlet here so some of its going out

591
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,010
into the river there's regulations in

592
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,260
this country as to how much ash can get

593
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,820
into the river system and our current

594
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,920
administration has been trying to weaken

595
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,740
those regulations so that coal power

596
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,630
plants can can add more to the rivers

597
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,420
than they have in the past I don't know

598
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,130
where that'll go and people were trying

599
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,200
to figure out what to do with all this

600
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,850
ash can we like mix it in concrete to

601
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,910
get rid of it we make something out of

602
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,950
it usually it's just buried so this

603
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,780
whole field here is all coal ash and

604
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,240
there are some event where there's a big

605
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:51,900
erosion here but all this dark stuff you

606
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,490
see is coal ash right they just kept

607
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,110
dumping and dumping in this field and

608
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,760
they had kept it wet and kept it wet and

609
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,280
they finally got something to grow on it

610
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,510
and really they just thought of a

611
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,400
solution they don't know what to do with

612
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:06,000
all of it there's been a couple of

613
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,640
disasters where coal ash has leaked out

614
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,450
from reservoir and there's a big

615
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,240
disaster

616
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,760
about 10 years ago in Tennessee where

617
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,890
one of these coal ash reservoirs broke

618
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,430
about 1:00 in the morning all of this

619
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:22,560
wet gooey coal ash comes out and goes

620
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,260
through town there's chunks of roads in

621
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,790
the hair it's kind of hard to see but

622
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:30,120
this is all muddy

623
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:33,240
coal ash that went through a town wiped

624
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,510
out some houses comes down gets in the

625
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,270
river gets carried downstream so there's

626
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:42,000
a lot of places in the United States

627
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:46,320
where coal ash is becoming a problem

628
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,650
this is a few years old now but this is

629
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,320
a map showing the yellow dots are places

630
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,720
where there are these waste ponds these

631
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,500
reservoirs that have coal ash sitting in

632
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:02,700
them staying wet places that are orange

633
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,250
are recognized as having a high hazard

634
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,890
potential of having a leak or a failure

635
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,350
and then the red ones or places where

636
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,700
there was some sort of failure or gotten

637
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,920
to the groundwater or something like

638
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,960
that happen so what you see here is

639
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,730
there's a lot of red dots out here but

640
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,500
of course there's just a lot more coal

641
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,750
fire power plants out here because

642
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,940
there's a lot more coal out here the

643
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,560
eastern part of the country has the

644
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,390
majority of the cold fire power plants

645
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,650
so they have the most coal ash and

646
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,890
therefore they have the most coal ash

647
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:35,100
related problems now we could burn

648
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:37,380
natural gas instead of coal and one

649
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,800
advantage of doing that is natural gas

650
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,540
has a much cleaner fuel to burn it's

651
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:47,540
cleaner in that it produces less

652
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:49,950
greenhouse gases than coal does now coal

653
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:53,070
produces all kinds of stuff produces co2

654
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:56,520
ash etc if I burn natural gas

655
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:59,280
I still get co2 but I get less of it and

656
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,380
there's no leftover ash product and we

657
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,490
don't have piles of coal everywhere so

658
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,510
all you have to do is you have to have a

659
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:09,150
pipe that takes the the the natural gas

660
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,890
from wherever came from so if you live

661
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,770
in Albuquerque the natural gas probably

662
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,060
came from somewhere around Carlsbad and

663
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,950
down the pipe that we talked about in

664
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,660
the past and it comes to a power plant

665
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,540
and here's for example you can see

666
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,830
there's four chimneys here there's four

667
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,160
turbines

668
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,320
and so they burn they burn it spins a

669
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,120
turbine just just like the coal does and

670
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,680
generates electricity that way here's

671
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,870
another one but what you don't see here

672
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,800
is you don't see the piles of coal and

673
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,960
all the apparatus for that so when we

674
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,570
talk about electricity there's some

675
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,030
vocabulary and some math that we gotta

676
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,950
get into and ultimately what we're

677
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:50,550
trying to do is calculate what we call

678
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:52,920
carbon footprint so where we're headed

679
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,110
in this class is if I do something like

680
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,380
I turn on an appliance for a certain

681
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,030
amount of time how much co2 did I

682
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,400
produce that's where we're headed with

683
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,380
all this okay so to get there there's a

684
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,170
couple things that we've got to know one

685
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:10,160
is energy and one is power and they're

686
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:15,930
related to each other and that power is

687
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:18,870
how much energy you use over the time

688
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:27,600
that you use it and you can think of

689
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:30,870
this as a rate of energy consumption now

690
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,940
a physicist does not like to use the

691
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:37,980
term consuming energy or using energy we

692
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,250
don't really talk about that way we

693
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,630
convert energy from one form to another

694
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,030
but in everyday language we talk about

695
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,180
things like I'm going to use energy or

696
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:50,190
waste energy right but just to be clear

697
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,610
we're just converting it from one form

698
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,110
to another but verbally we say things

699
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:58,350
that are different than that and I will

700
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:02,220
too because that's how we talk so rate

701
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:06,390
of energy consumption is power it's how

702
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,330
fast are using the energy and the unit

703
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:14,480
that we use for this is called the Wat

704
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:16,770
Hey so James Watt he's a guy that helped

705
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,240
develop the steam engine back in the

706
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:25,800
1700s and so his last name is used today

707
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:32,340
as a unit of power and one watt means

708
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:33,510
you're using one Joule of energy per

709
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,270
second

710
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,910
now that probably has no meaning to you

711
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,980
either because what's a jewel and that's

712
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,750
a unit that if you're a physicist that

713
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,919
would make sense to you what a jewel is

714
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,710
but it's not something we have in

715
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,590
everyday use but if you think about

716
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,270
taking an apple and lifting it one meter

717
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,429
off the ground right so you pick it up

718
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,740
off the ground one meter that's about a

719
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:57,000
Joule of energy it took you a Joule of

720
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,419
energy to do that

721
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,240
so one watt would mean do you use it one

722
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,429
Joule of energy for every second right

723
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,630
okay so this is power and you've heard

724
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:11,820
of this because for one thing you may

725
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,260
have heard in terms of lightbulbs right

726
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,669
so you might hear something like a

727
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:20,820
hundred watt light bulb right you may

728
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:23,280
have heard of it that way or some guys

729
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:27,480
can tell you that they have a you know

730
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,679
thousand watt stereo right so that is it

731
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,230
you know another place you may have

732
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,480
heard about it if you have a hairdryer

733
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:37,470
on the side and I have a number like

734
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:39,809
1300 or 1350 those are that's its rating

735
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,940
and Watts so watts is something you

736
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:44,100
probably have heard of before and this

737
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,660
is all power it's how you a 100 watt

738
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,660
light bulb means it uses a hundred

739
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,190
joules of energy of electricity every

740
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,140
second that's what it means a thousand

741
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,190
watt stereo is capable of using a

742
00:32:52,140 --> 00:33:05,340
thousand joules a second all right so

743
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:07,320
energy is the converse of this power

744
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,770
times time so I'm just taking this

745
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,290
formula and rewriting it solving it it's

746
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:16,679
the same exact formula but here's how we

747
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:22,440
we would do this let's imagine that I've

748
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:29,669
got a 60 watt light bulb and I have it

749
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:33,540
on for let's say four hours how much

750
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:37,620
energy did I use again we're using the

751
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:39,150
word use energy consumed energy whatever

752
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,350
we're converting it from one form to the

753
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:45,059
other but blah blah blah we know that

754
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:46,080
okay so what do we do math is easy 60

755
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:52,130
watts

756
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:57,930
times four hours and 60 times four is

757
00:33:52,130 --> 00:34:00,030
240 now I've got the unit of watts I got

758
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:03,800
a unit of hours and when they multiply

759
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:14,480
these two together we write it as what

760
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:19,290
time's our so this what our is by itself

761
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,210
the unit of energy okay

762
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,149
so in physics there's a bunch of

763
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,740
different units of energy the one we're

764
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,330
going to use in this class and the only

765
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,940
one we're gonna use in this class is

766
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,300
something called the watt hour how many

767
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,210
watts times how many hours you take that

768
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,340
watt times that our it becomes watt hour

769
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,280
that's it's like its own thing the watt

770
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,929
hour it's not watts per hour that would

771
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:50,399
be divided by its Watts times hour okay

772
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:52,260
so verbal you'd say this 240 watt hours

773
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,260
that's how you would say it okay so

774
00:34:52,260 --> 00:35:00,650
that's what that means now let's do

775
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:06,350
another example and let's say I now have

776
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:08,700
I've got a hundred watt light bulb and

777
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:12,600
let's say it's a porch light and I turn

778
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:18,000
it on and I just leave it on okay so

779
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:20,010
it's on for 24 hours a day and I'd like

780
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:29,300
to know how much energy I'm using in a

781
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:33,870
week energy used in one week okay so

782
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:39,840
energy the formula that we just had less

783
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:44,150
power times time okay so power is always

784
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,110
in watts time is always in hours and

785
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,080
sometimes you've got to do a little math

786
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:52,500
to figure out what your total hours are

787
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,270
so in this case my energy is somewhat so

788
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,450
Energy's power to assign power is 100

789
00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:00,450
watts okay so what's my time gonna be

790
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:03,580
well it's on 24 hours a day

791
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:05,050
but it's on for a week right so there's

792
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,350
seven days in a week so I multiply that

793
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:12,370
by seven okay so I've got a hundred

794
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:13,620
watts times 24 times seven so let me do

795
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:22,150
that real quick

796
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:25,170
100 times 24 times seven equals sixteen

797
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:31,000
thousand eight hundred now my units are

798
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:36,370
watt hours okay 16 thousand eight

799
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:40,600
hundred watt hours now if you have over

800
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:42,550
a thousand watt hours we're going to

801
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:52,180
we're going to alter that unit a little

802
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:56,500
bit okay if I have over a thousand the

803
00:36:52,180 --> 00:37:00,250
convention that we do is we divide by a

804
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:03,190
thousand and add a K in front of it so

805
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:10,030
if I have over a thousand watt hours I'm

806
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:18,880
going to divide the answer by a thousand

807
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:21,910
and then add a little K to the unit all

808
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:28,900
right it's like this so sixteen thousand

809
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:31,270
eight hundred watt hours it's over a

810
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,200
thousand so I'm then divided by a

811
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:43,150
thousand and I get sixteen point eight

812
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:47,370
and I know that add k2 watt hours all

813
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:53,590
right so the way that verbally reads is

814
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:57,400
16.8 kilowatt hours but people got tired

815
00:37:53,590 --> 00:38:00,240
of writing all that out so there's an

816
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:08,770
abbreviation for the kilowatt hours

817
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:12,970
it's called K WH and this is called when

818
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:20,140
we talk about a kWh we say verbally you

819
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:23,700
is a kilowatt-hour that's how we say it

820
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:36,340
a kilowatt hour and the kilowatt hour is

821
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:44,619
the worldwide standard for measuring

822
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:47,859
electrical energy okay so outside your

823
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:51,550
house you have a kilowatt hour meter

824
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:54,430
because this is how the power company

825
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,560
charges you for the electricity that you

826
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,480
use so here's an old-school one that's

827
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,510
got the dials on it right and the guys

828
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,960
come over and there's this you know this

829
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:06,400
disc spins right here and the more

830
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,900
electricity you use the faster it spins

831
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,900
and these dials tell somebody how many

832
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,900
kilowatt hours yeah you have used since

833
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:19,390
the last time the meter reader person

834
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:22,660
came out and took a reading and then

835
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:25,030
you're charged by your kilowatt hours so

836
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:28,150
notice that this meter actually spells

837
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:34,180
out kilowatt hours and this one just

838
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:36,490
says kWh right so when you're charged by

839
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:41,050
the electric company so for example

840
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:45,359
around here it's usually PNM is our

841
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,359
electric company you will get charged

842
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:53,859
per kilowatt hour right so a rate

843
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,560
depends on kind of where you live but

844
00:39:53,859 --> 00:40:01,510
maybe somewhere between on the low end

845
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:05,040
maybe eight cents - depending on where

846
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:08,589
you live may be as high as 30 cents per

847
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,930
kilowatt hour so we're going to learn

848
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:13,000
how to calculate a carbon footprint

849
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,609
which just means how much carbon are we

850
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,440
putting into the atmosphere when we do

851
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:20,320
different things and we're focusing in

852
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,320
this class on electricity cuz it's kind

853
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,450
of the easiest one to deal with so let's

854
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,220
imagine that all of my electricity is

855
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:31,060
being generated

856
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,740
by coal and so if I do an activity let's

857
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,109
say I leave a light on for a certain

858
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,020
number of hours or TV on for a certain

859
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:41,290
number of hours I want to know how much

860
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,810
coal had to be burned to do that and as

861
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:47,470
a result how much carbon got into the

862
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:49,930
atmosphere because of that okay so there

863
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,119
are modern coal-fired power plants there

864
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,859
are older Coldfire power plants they're

865
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,590
not all the same efficiency but when you

866
00:40:53,859 --> 00:41:06,280
look at all of them roughly it comes out

867
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:07,570
that to generate one kilowatt hour to

868
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,520
generate one kilowatt hour of

869
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:17,820
electricity with coal you need to burn

870
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:20,950
one kilogram or about 2.2 pounds of coal

871
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,930
and that's about the size of a big

872
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,880
shoebox right so imagine kind of

873
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:28,359
extra-large shoebox full of coal that's

874
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,250
about how much you need okay so the

875
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,320
problems that we're gonna have are all

876
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,510
kind of the same format which is that

877
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,760
we'll have a scenario we want to know

878
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,359
how much coal is going to be burned and

879
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:44,560
then we're going to figure out from that

880
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:49,619
how much co2 is produced so it turns out

881
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,619
that when you burn one kilogram of coal

882
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:09,730
that you will produce two kilograms of

883
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:15,960
co2 gas or if I burn 2.2 pounds to put

884
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:24,160
it in our unit system we get 4.4 pounds

885
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:27,910
of co2 so in other words I get more co2

886
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,369
out of the chimney then the amount of

887
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:33,820
coal that I put in why would that be

888
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:35,440
because the call reacts when you burn

889
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,940
the coal it reacts with oxygen in the

890
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,970
air to produce more co2 so so one

891
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,000
kilogram of coal

892
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:47,569
to kilograms of co2 all right

893
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,190
that's we're talking about mass of a gas

894
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:51,040
which is abstract cuz we don't think

895
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,510
about gases is having mass but they do

896
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,220
so how much would that be if I had what

897
00:42:53,510 --> 00:43:00,290
if I had two kilograms of co2 like how

898
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:07,490
much is that right if you could see it

899
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:11,770
and if you could see it it would be it

900
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:16,069
could feel cube that's about one meter

901
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:19,880
on a side so we call that one cubic

902
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:27,109
meter and one cubic meter is about one

903
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:29,780
thousand liters okay so think if I for

904
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:34,640
every kilowatt hour that I use in

905
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:38,619
electricity I have to burn one kilogram

906
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,930
of coal which makes two kilograms of co2

907
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:45,770
which would fill up a thousand liters of

908
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,930
co2 gas okay so that's those are the

909
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,060
numbers we've been using this class to

910
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:53,450
do the problems but they're all kind of

911
00:43:50,060 --> 00:44:03,589
similar so here's an example so let's

912
00:43:53,450 --> 00:44:06,770
say I have a TV that uses 330 watts and

913
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:14,000
I have this TV on let's say six hours a

914
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:16,250
day all right and let's say I do this

915
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,260
every single day for a month so we'll

916
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:24,050
say 30 days okay so here's the scenario

917
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,760
how much ultimately here's what I want

918
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,960
to know how much co2 did I put in the

919
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,810
atmosphere because of this right so to

920
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:36,530
answer that we've got to figure out how

921
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:42,349
many kilowatt hours how much coal and

922
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:44,060
how much co2 then it all starts on these

923
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,760
problems with figuring out the kilowatt

924
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,470
hours if you know the kilowatt hours you

925
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,079
can get to all the other things you need

926
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:52,520
to solve for all right so that's we're

927
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,450
going to do first we're going to figure

928
00:44:52,520 --> 00:45:00,920
out how much energy did

929
00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,920
this take so energy is power times time

930
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:08,520
what's my power 330 watts what's my time

931
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:12,570
okay so it's got to be in hours it's six

932
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:17,160
hours a day but I'm doing this for 30

933
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:20,390
days so my total hours is 6 times 30 so

934
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,609
it's multiply all that out so I've got

935
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:35,180
330 oops

936
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:40,680
330 times 6 times 30 equals 59400 what

937
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:43,560
hours okay so 4000 divided by a thousand

938
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,890
turn it into kilowatt hours so I'm gonna

939
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:54,420
divide by a thousand and that gives me

940
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:57,500
fifty nine point four kWh all right this

941
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:01,680
is what we need to do the rest

942
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:03,960
so for every kill we see in the

943
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,480
beginning for every kilowatt hour I need

944
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:10,500
to burn one kilogram or 2.2 pounds of

945
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:15,810
coal so let's say I ask you pounds of

946
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:19,020
coal how many pounds of coal did I have

947
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:22,280
to burn in that month right so I take my

948
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:27,319
fifty nine point four kilowatt hours

949
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:34,099
times two point two pounds oops 2.2

950
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:36,950
pounds of coal for every kilowatt hour

951
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:40,800
so I just take that number fifty nine

952
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:49,319
point four times two point two and I get

953
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:51,000
130 point seven pounds so that's how

954
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:54,450
many pounds of coal I had to burn that

955
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:02,960
month for my TV so how much co2 did I

956
00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:06,290
make well if I ask for say pounds of co2

957
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,210
then I would go back to my

958
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:13,760
fifty nine point fifty nine point four

959
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:17,840
kilowatt hours times four point four so

960
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:21,320
I get four point four pounds of co2 for

961
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:25,970
every kilowatt hour and now I can just

962
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:32,050
take the one I just got and I get two

963
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:32,050
sixty one point four pounds of co2

964
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:39,890
so that's pounds of a gas how many

965
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:42,980
liters is that I go back to the kilowatt

966
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:53,480
hours and multiply by a thousand so if I

967
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:55,490
go back to how many liters of co2 then I

968
00:47:53,480 --> 00:48:00,670
go back to my kilowatt hours which is

969
00:47:55,490 --> 00:48:04,090
fifty nine point four times a thousand

970
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:11,000
liters per every kilowatt hour and

971
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:15,260
that's pretty easy math 59400 liters of

972
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,119
co2 so in all these problems you go back

973
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:21,890
to the kilowatt hours and multiply that

974
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,330
by two point two or one or a thousand

975
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:29,020
depending on what your what you're

976
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:32,119
trying to solve for or what if the cost

977
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:35,900
financial cost let's say you're charging

978
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:38,480
me eleven cents a kilowatt hour how much

979
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:41,810
money does that cost me to run my TV per

980
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:46,460
month I take fifty nine point four

981
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:53,750
kilowatt hours times eleven cents per

982
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:56,810
kilowatt hour and fifty nine point four

983
00:48:53,750 --> 00:49:02,540
times point one one and I get six

984
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:07,640
dollars and 53 cents so if you compare

985
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:11,240
these two things the financial cost in

986
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,670
this country is very low to generating

987
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,200
fifty nine point four kilowatt hours

988
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,250
that's actually quite a bit of

989
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,800
electricity if you had to do that

990
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,970
manually by cranking something I mean it

991
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:25,070
would take you weeks of work

992
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:27,650
to do this only costs us $6.50 and yet

993
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:31,190
it produces close to sixty thousand

994
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:32,510
liters of co2 into the atmosphere so

995
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,310
this is one of the problems that we deal

996
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:37,880
with in environmental science that there

997
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:40,040
is a financial cost which is not very

998
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,900
big and there's an environmental cost

999
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,750
which can be huge

1000
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:47,270
nobody's paying for this upfront right

1001
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:50,780
we pay for this but this is really the

1002
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:54,109
cost that we're worried about in in this

1003
00:49:50,780 --> 00:50:03,290
class okay so let's do another example

1004
00:49:54,109 --> 00:50:07,970
let's say I've got a 60 watt let's see

1005
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:13,340
let's say I got 60 watt porch light in

1006
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:18,700
the front and I got a hundred watt porch

1007
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:20,980
light in the back of my house alright so

1008
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:30,940
one in the front one in the back and

1009
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:34,730
they're on 24 hours a day how much coal

1010
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:42,830
do I need to burn for these just these

1011
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:46,660
two light bulbs in a year so I got to

1012
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,660
get my kilowatt hours first

1013
00:50:51,470 --> 00:51:03,410
okay what's my power I've got 60 water

1014
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:10,470
and 100 water what's my time 24 hours

1015
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:21,750
all year long times 365 so that gives me

1016
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:29,460
160 watts times 24 times 365 hours so i

1017
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:36,569
have 160 times 24 times 365 I get 1

1018
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:39,809
million 400 1600 watt hours okay

1019
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:42,329
I got divided by thousand to turn it

1020
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:48,510
into kilowatt hours so divided by

1021
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:51,720
thousand and I get 1400 1.6 kilowatt

1022
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:58,289
hours and this is remember for the whole

1023
00:51:51,720 --> 00:52:04,020
year how many pounds of coal let's say I

1024
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:07,079
ask that question so so what we said is

1025
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:10,410
if you know your kilowatt hours multiply

1026
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:15,029
that by 2.2 so I take one thousand four

1027
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:22,710
hundred and one kilowatt hours 2.2

1028
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:27,270
pounds so one thousand four hundred and

1029
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:31,500
one point six times two point two and I

1030
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:37,430
get three thousand eighty three point

1031
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,430
five pounds of coal oops

1032
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:49,230
pounds of coal

1033
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:52,130
all right liters of co2 I go back to my

1034
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,130
kilowatt hours

1035
00:52:53,319 --> 00:53:00,609
and it's a thousand liters for every

1036
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:09,849
kilowatt hour so that gets me 1 million

1037
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:09,849
for 1600 liters the co2

1038
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:18,920
how about cost let's say it costs 13

1039
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:29,569
cents kilowatt hour then I go back to my

1040
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:40,809
kilowatt hours 1401 point 6 times 13

1041
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:47,900
cents 1401 point 6 times 0.1 3 I get

1042
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:51,589
$182 and 21 cents ok so that's the cost

1043
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:53,359
in terms of financial and the cost in

1044
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:56,109
terms of the environmental of leaving

1045
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:59,410
those two light bulbs on 24 hours a day

1046
00:53:56,109 --> 00:54:01,849
so these problems can get more and more

1047
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:04,130
complicated but it's the same math every

1048
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:05,270
time its power times time so we'll do

1049
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:07,460
one more that's slightly more

1050
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:16,789
complicated so you can see how you might

1051
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:19,549
do something like this so we could have

1052
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:25,520
a scenario such as this I've got a 60

1053
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:31,549
watt porch light and it's on for 12

1054
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:39,109
hours a day 12 hours a day I have a 210

1055
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:47,660
watt TV it's on for 4 hours a day inside

1056
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:50,950
I have two 120 watt lamps they are on

1057
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,950
for 6 hours a day

1058
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:55,869
what is my

1059
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:06,210
carbon footprint for the year

1060
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:09,660
okay so we're assuming the same usage

1061
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:12,240
every day so what does carbon footprint

1062
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:18,450
mean how much coal did I burn how much

1063
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:24,630
co2 co2 did I produce alright so same

1064
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:27,000
math energy is power times time I guy

1065
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,520
add it all up and do all the math so I

1066
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
can do a piecewise so in other words I

1067
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:40,160
can say all right let's do the porch

1068
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:46,730
lights I've got 60 watts times 12 hours

1069
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:53,100
times 365 days a year I've got the TV

1070
00:55:46,730 --> 00:56:03,330
the TV is 210 watts times 4 hours times

1071
00:55:53,100 --> 00:56:04,910
365 I got the lamps I've got 120 watt

1072
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:09,440
lamps but there's two of them and

1073
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:13,020
they're on for six hours a day times 365

1074
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,610
ok so so I'm just dividing each one of

1075
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:20,430
these up each time power times time and

1076
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:31,010
I can do each one and then add them all

1077
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:43,340
up so 60 times 12 times 365 I get 2

1078
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:48,570
moves 260 2800 watt hours for the TVs I

1079
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:52,830
get 210 times four times three six two

1080
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:56,730
five three hundred six thousand six

1081
00:56:52,830 --> 00:57:01,490
hundred watt hours and for the lamps I

1082
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:10,050
get home 20 times two times six times

1083
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:12,750
365 525,600 watt hours now

1084
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:14,760
what I'm going to do is go ahead and and

1085
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:17,790
divide each of those by a thousand and

1086
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:23,390
turn them into kWh so that gift

1087
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:28,730
gets me to sixty two point eight KW h 3o

1088
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:34,710
6.6 kWh five twenty five point six kwh

1089
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:37,890
add them all up take my two sixty two

1090
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:42,650
point eight plus three o six point six

1091
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:46,670
plus five twenty five point six equals

1092
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:53,250
thousand ninety five kilowatt hours per

1093
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:57,120
year okay so now if I said all right how

1094
00:57:53,250 --> 00:58:02,640
much how many kilograms of coal would we

1095
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:08,070
have to burn for this so then we'll do a

1096
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:11,820
couple here so kilograms of coal well I

1097
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:15,600
can take that many kilowatt hours

1098
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:21,030
thousand ninety-five one kilogram one

1099
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:25,250
kilogram of co2 oops I'm sorry one

1100
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:29,340
kilogram of coal for every kilowatt hour

1101
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:33,390
means I get one thousand that thousand

1102
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:35,310
ninety five kilograms of coal alright

1103
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:37,650
that's pretty easy calculation you're

1104
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:44,250
just multiplying by one right well if I

1105
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:47,870
said pounds of coal all right then I got

1106
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:56,330
a thousand ninety five kilowatt hours

1107
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:56,330
times 2.2 pounds per coal sorry

1108
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:07,710
pounds per kilowatt-hour so I just take

1109
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:18,230
that multiply that by two point two and

1110
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:24,230
you get 24 oh nine pounds of coal or

1111
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:29,160
what if I said how many liters of co2 I

1112
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:32,610
go back to my kilowatt hours and

1113
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:45,080
multiply that by a thousand thousand

1114
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:50,900
liters per kilowatt hour and I get 109

1115
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:58,080
500 so a million 95 thousand liters a

1116
00:59:50,900 --> 01:00:00,680
co2 okay etc right so so that the

1117
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:04,440
problems are all of the similar nature

1118
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:08,870
get it to kilowatt hours multiply it by

1119
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,870
one of those factors get the answer
