1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:06,359
so if we want to reduce our carbon

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:10,019
footprint then we can either not use

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,880
electricity as much as possible or we

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,190
can try to replace something that's

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,990
inefficient with something that's more

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,199
efficient that does the same job but

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,710
uses less electricity in the example

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,470
we're going to use in this class as with

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:27,539
lightbulbs so we're gonna we're going to

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,460
learn a little bit about different types

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,289
of types of light bulb technology and

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,670
then we'll do some math problems on how

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:39,149
to calculate how much carbon you would

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,910
save by swapping out different types of

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,399
light bulbs so right now on the market

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,870
for consumer there's three basic types

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,420
of light bulbs there's the incandescent

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,690
the compact fluorescent and the

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,079
light-emitting diode also known as LEDs

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,270
okay so incandescent these things have

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,430
been around since the late 1800s these

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,219
are the of all the things in your house

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,110
that use electricity if you have an

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,040
incandescent light bulb it is the most

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,479
obsolete by far okay and the way it

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,280
works is that there's this little wire

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,409
in here called the filament it's made of

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,299
tungsten and the electricity flows

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,720
through this wire and it gets so hot

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,570
that it glows now it turns out they're

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,479
very very inefficient and you can think

32
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,490
of it as like a heater that happens to

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,900
make some light so if you go up to a 60

34
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,210
watt or a hundred watt light bulb or

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,829
even a 40 watt light bulb and you you

36
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,619
try to put your hand on it you can't

37
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,759
it's just it's too hot it's mostly just

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,140
making heat instead of light so if you

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,180
did the math which we're not going to do

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,130
it's like about one percent efficient so

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,770
if you put a hundred Watts in you're

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,750
getting one watt of light out and all

43
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:55,320
the rest is heat now pros they're very

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,270
cheap to make so like I know 25 cents a

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,860
piece or something like that and there's

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,229
a lot of people who think this is the

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,890
way light bulbs should look they like

48
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:08,729
the look of this style light bulb okay

49
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,480
but cons very very inefficient so then

50
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,930
and starting in the 40s people started

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,310
making 4s

52
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,010
lights and at first enter these long

53
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,659
tubes about eight feet long and then

54
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,400
people figure out how to miniaturize it

55
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:25,359
so that you can fit them in a small

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,269
socket and inside this this is a glass

57
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:30,010
tube that has a little tiny amount of

58
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:33,370
mercury in it like a milligram of

59
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,290
mercury and this funny white plastic

60
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,200
base here has a high voltage power

61
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,469
supply and what it does is when the

62
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,689
light goes on it excites the mercury

63
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:45,579
atoms and the electrons the outer

64
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:46,959
electrons in the mercury as they jump

65
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:49,079
back and forth between their different

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,819
orbitals and that produces light and

67
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:55,239
it's much more efficient than it make an

68
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:58,780
incandescent light bulb so this is a big

69
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,450
improvement over the incandescent lights

70
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,769
but the problem the problem is is that

71
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,599
it has a little bit of mercury mercury

72
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,540
is very poisonous as we learned in an

73
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,859
earlier lecture so when this bulb is

74
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,569
burned out you're not supposed to just

75
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,489
throw it away because if it goes in the

76
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,049
landfill and then the glass breaks and

77
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,950
then the mercury gets out and gets into

78
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,319
the groundwater

79
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,319
so disposal is a big problem with

80
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,400
compact fluorescents but they are more

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,889
efficient they use less electricity so

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,109
and by the way another con these

83
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:32,500
compacts have been around since the 70s

84
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:34,239
in the last decade they got pretty good

85
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,220
to where it was hard for most people to

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,590
even tell if you had one or not but the

87
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,060
early models were really ugly to look at

88
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,739
the light just didn't quite look right

89
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,650
there's a weird color now within the

90
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,269
last few years we're in the era of

91
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,689
light-emitting diodes and this has been

92
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:56,769
a huge revolution in lighting so in an

93
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:58,889
LED there's actual silicon chip it's the

94
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,530
same technology as a computer chip and

95
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:05,049
when the electricity flows through it it

96
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,310
produces light and how that happens is

97
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,729
pretty complicated we're just going to

98
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,989
kind of skip that part but inside here

99
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,329
there's a bunch of chips and they're

100
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,430
flat and they're in this case they're

101
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:18,449
they're lined up horizontally and

102
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,409
they're shooting the light straight up

103
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,779
so then what they do is they put a

104
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:25,870
diffuser on top to scatter the light in

105
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,430
all directions so that chip is called a

106
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,220
light-emitting diode so this

107
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,080
called the LED light they last a very

108
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,930
long time you can make them any color

109
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,850
they're very efficient if you see an LED

110
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,229
you put your hand on it it's it's barely

111
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:43,150
warm and they have been traditionally

112
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:45,580
LEDs have been very expensive to make

113
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,229
just in the last few years that's really

114
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,419
radically changed and now there's really

115
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:52,810
no excuse not to switch your bulbs over

116
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,360
to LEDs I mean I have a catalog from

117
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,460
like 20 years ago when one single LED

118
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,870
bulb is over a hundred dollars and now

119
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,030
you can get like three of them for 10

120
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,220
bucks at Home Depot and there there's

121
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,810
just tons of them out now this is what

122
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,150
an LED looks like if you were to take it

123
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,610
apart here's the little chips and

124
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,349
they're oriented so that they fire the

125
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,509
light comes perpendicular from the

126
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:15,310
surface so this one would be like a

127
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,380
spotlight light only goes in one

128
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,750
direction which is why they have to put

129
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,550
a diffuser on it to scatter the light in

130
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,320
all directions but they're coming out

131
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,900
with all kinds of things so for example

132
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,000
there are now these bulbs that have this

133
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,889
old-school light bulb appearance with

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,389
the filaments but the filaments

135
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,400
themselves are actually a little tiny

136
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,590
silicon chips they are a little tiny

137
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,750
versions of this that light up and you

138
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,430
can't tell the difference when they're

139
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,680
lit up I mean most people can't tell the

140
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,010
difference between the modern LEDs and

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,990
the old old-style Bowl Edison bulbs so

142
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,220
this is really changing lighting

143
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,990
technology so there's there are similar

144
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,389
stories with with a lot of the

145
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,570
technology in are in their homes so for

146
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:01,000
example 10 years ago a plasma television

147
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,900
65 inch plasma television used close to

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,380
800 watts now the same size television

149
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,340
using LEDs for the lighting eighty-eight

150
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,199
Watts right huge difference and all the

151
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,270
computers used more electricity or

152
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,220
refrigerators use more electricity we

153
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,650
could go on and on through all kinds of

154
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,759
technology but in this class what we're

155
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,940
going to do is we're going to do some

156
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,039
math with bulb replacements and it's the

157
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,380
same math that we've done before but

158
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,889
this time it's we're gonna swap out one

159
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,680
bulb for another okay so I'm going to do

160
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,750
an example of a bulb replacement type

161
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,430
problem and they're pretty

162
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,350
straightforward is just kind of common

163
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,520
sense you're going to do the

164
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,290
you're going to do the math with the old

165
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,450
bulb you're going to do the math of the

166
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,570
new bulb and subtract the differences

167
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:58,410
okay so let's say I've got a hundred

168
00:06:49,570 --> 00:07:05,230
watt porch light and this thing is on

169
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:08,830
for 12 hours a day okay and I'm going to

170
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,180
replace it so this is incandescent right

171
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:16,180
I should I should have said that

172
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:23,140
incandescent I'm gonna replace this with

173
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:26,170
a 12 watt LED okay and I'm gonna my

174
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,360
usage is not going to change I'm just

175
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,410
gonna leave it on 24 hours a day no I'm

176
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,480
sorry 12 hours a day

177
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,020
okay so 100 watt light bulb incandescent

178
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,420
for 12 hours a day I swap it out with a

179
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,050
12 watt LED that makes the same amount

180
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,770
of light but it only uses 12 Watts 12

181
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,730
hours a day

182
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:54,400
how much do I save in a year that's the

183
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:58,300
question right so how much do I save in

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,970
a year and we can ask this question

185
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,740
several ways we could that could be coal

186
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:10,060
that could be co2 that could be money

187
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:11,920
okay so solve for the old bulb solve for

188
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,450
the new bulb subtract the difference

189
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:19,000
that's the easiest way to think about

190
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:22,750
this all right so the old bulb I got now

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,610
remember on these problems we got to get

192
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,440
to kilowatt hours before we can do

193
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:34,030
anything else so I'm gonna use my

194
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,979
energies power times time and I need to

195
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,969
figure out how much energy the old bulb

196
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,950
is gonna use in a year okay so in one

197
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:45,419
year

198
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,419
oops one year

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:57,630
I've got the 100 watt light bulb 12

200
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:59,550
hours a day hours times 365 and I'm just

201
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,500
gonna go ahead and divide by a thousand

202
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:12,840
to get it into kilowatt hours right away

203
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:18,350
so I take 100 times 12 times 365 divided

204
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:22,920
by a thousand and that gets me 438

205
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,360
kilowatt hours all right now if you

206
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,830
wanted to do it separate steps you could

207
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,450
I just kind of did an all one thing

208
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:39,560
there now this is the old bulb all right

209
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:42,480
the new bulb is 12 Watts 12 hours a day

210
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,010
365 days in the year and when I go ahead

211
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,080
and divide by a thousand to convert it

212
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:53,340
to kilowatt hours and twelve times

213
00:09:49,080 --> 00:10:03,620
twelve times 365 divided by a thousand

214
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:03,620
equals 52 0.56 kilowatt hours okay so

215
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:13,740
here's the old here's the new right so I

216
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,840
can do this I can do this next math one

217
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,150
of several ways I will do it the way

218
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,280
that I think makes the most sense but if

219
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:24,450
you know what's going on you can you can

220
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,390
you can alter this method what I would

221
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,030
do to just make this easy as possible

222
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,520
let's say we're going to calculate how

223
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:38,910
much money we save right let's calculate

224
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:42,480
the amount of money we save from doing

225
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,770
this right the way to do this again more

226
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,460
than one wait but the way I'm going to

227
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:49,530
do it is figure out the amount for the

228
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,640
old bulb figure out the amount for the

229
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,780
new bulb and then subtract all right I

230
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,420
think that's the most straightforward

231
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:02,649
way of thinking about this so

232
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,620
the old bulb let's say we're charged 13

233
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:09,970
cents a kilowatt-hour right if I use

234
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:16,680
that number the old bulb 438 kilowatt

235
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:23,010
hours times 13 cents and the new bulb is

236
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:31,000
52 0.56 kilowatt hours times 13 cents

237
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:35,740
right so let's 438 times point one three

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,560
is fifty six dollars and ninety four

239
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:46,089
cents and the new bulb point 56 times

240
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:49,180
point one three is six dollars and

241
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:53,519
eighty three cents and then I'm going to

242
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,519
subtract the two so the difference is

243
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:05,140
$56 94 cents - six dollars 83 cents so

244
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:10,480
56 point ninety four minus six point

245
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:15,160
eight three is fifty dollars eleven

246
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,850
cents okay so this is how much money I

247
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,949
saved

248
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,630
so I calculated the dollars for the old

249
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:23,079
bulb the dollars from the new bulb

250
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,390
subtract the two okay same technique to

251
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:30,910
solve any other question if I asked okay

252
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:34,329
well how much coal did I save from this

253
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:43,720
it'd be the same way so let's let's just

254
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:50,170
do that let's say I have coal saved for

255
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:52,570
example the old bulb I go back to the

256
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:58,630
kilowatt hours I had four hundred

257
00:12:52,570 --> 00:13:01,440
thirty-eight kilowatt hours and what's

258
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,440
doing pounds

259
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:10,900
okay how many pounds of coal is that is

260
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:23,430
2.2 pounds per kilowatt-hour do that

261
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:28,170
math for 38 times 2.2 is 960 3.6 pounds

262
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:40,060
that's the old one and then the new one

263
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:44,650
is 50 2.56 kilowatt hours 2.2 pounds per

264
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:49,060
kilowatt hour so I take 52 point five

265
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:52,470
six times two point two and I get a

266
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,020
hundred and fifteen point six pounds

267
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,000
that's the old one and if I wanna know

268
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,340
how much coal did I save how much coal

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,540
do I not have to burn now because I

270
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:07,690
replaced that one light bulb the coal

271
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:12,040
saved is the difference between those

272
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:15,990
which is 960 3.6 pounds minus one

273
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,990
hundred fifteen point six pounds and

274
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:25,330
nine sixty three point six minus one one

275
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:33,580
five point six is eight hundred and

276
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:37,090
forty eight pounds saved so one of the

277
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,520
themes here notice all he did is I took

278
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,700
one single light bulb and I replaced it

279
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,340
right that's it nothing else changed

280
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,220
except that one light bulb and by me

281
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:52,420
doing that I save 850 pounds of coal

282
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,360
every year so now imagine I did that to

283
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,490
all the bulbs in my house and now

284
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,280
imagine everybody else in the United

285
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,170
States does the same thing and what

286
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,820
happens is we start to realize you could

287
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,880
save so much coal that we could actually

288
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,130
shut off mini coal fire power plants

289
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,500
would we want to even need them that's

290
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,440
how much coal you could save by just

291
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,070
swapping light bulbs so once in a while

292
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,050
you might

293
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,280
see a billboard there used to be some in

294
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,550
town I haven't seen them in the while

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,530
and it talks about you know if every

296
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,840
person just were to change one light

297
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,150
bulb in their house then you know X

298
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,900
would happen that's actually true

299
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,550
because if there's 350 million of us in

300
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,400
the United States alone and we all just

301
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,650
replaced one light bulb then take that

302
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,500
number multiply it by 350 million

303
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:44,590
and suddenly you've got lots of coal

304
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,580
that you're saving from getting burning

305
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,580
going into the atmosphere
