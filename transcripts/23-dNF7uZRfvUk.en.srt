00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:10,889
hi I'm Mel and in this lecture we're

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,730
going to talk about the reasons why you

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,199
should recycle aluminum cans so we've

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,850
been talking about electricity and it's

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,430
related to that but let's start out with

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,180
talking about one of the reasons why we

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,390
do not recycle aluminum so aluminum is

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,820
not a rare element that's some thing we

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,830
need to establish if I look at all of

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,669
the the common elements that's in the

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,980
crust of the earth

12
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,739
number one is oxygen number two is

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,270
silicon number three is aluminum okay

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,700
seven and a half percent of everything

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,620
in the crust is aluminum now it's not

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,079
pure aluminum metal it's aluminum mixed

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,960
in with other elements to form minerals

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,449
point being we don't recycle aluminum

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,219
because aluminum itself is rare there's

20
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,160
other reason there's another reason why

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,460
so let's talk about how we actually get

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,940
aluminum metal and so what we're working

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,400
up towards is the steps to get from this

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,659
material which is called bauxite and

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,549
it's these red blogs that have aluminum

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,950
bearing minerals in there we're going to

27
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,320
work towards the step from this rock to

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,939
say an aluminum can like what is

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,460
required

30
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:23,820
okay so bauxite is a mixture of these

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,850
red blobs and from a distance bauxite

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,060
often has this reddish appearance and

33
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,100
bauxite forms wherever you had a lot of

34
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,960
precipitation for a long period of time

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,430
so what happens is all of the rains so

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,040
think of like a rain forest what rains

37
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,310
almost every day it reaches the soil

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,619
away and the only components that are

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,100
left over are these aluminum burying

40
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,020
compounds called bauxite so what we're

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,470
looking at here is a remnant of a

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,229
ancient soil that is left over from an

43
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,229
era where there's a lot of precipitation

44
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:59,670
so you might have an area that's

45
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,799
tropical today and there's lots of rain

46
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,590
and that's leaving behind the bauxite or

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,860
you might find a remnant of an ancient

48
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,770
box I'd soil from the geologic past

49
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,650
either way this red material that's left

50
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,099
behind after all of that precipitation

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,400
contains a lot of this mineral bauxite

52
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:22,170
so first thing they got to do is just

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,610
simply dig it up and so that's what

54
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,720
they're doing here you see all this red

55
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,689
box site in the foreground here and

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,280
bauxite mines are very red like

57
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,010
everything's red because this bauxite

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,079
mineral itself is red so here's one from

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,730
the from the air you can see the roads

60
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:43,920
are red the mine mining areas are red

61
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:46,319
here the buildings are red everything in

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,480
this in this photo is kind of a reddish

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,040
tint this is all bauxite that's being

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,690
mined now you can kind of see the where

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,690
there's runoff from a bauxite mine

66
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,500
because it it will also be red so this

67
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,750
was a river and it's filled with this

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,379
reddish muck here

69
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,569
that's bauxite runoff here's a here's a

70
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,250
place where there there was an overflow

71
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,109
of a river and you can see this reddish

72
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,109
material that went through here that's

73
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,280
again from a bauxite mine

74
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:19,440
there are some places in the world where

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,989
bauxite is being mined it gets into the

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,510
water so you see this reddish in this

77
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,930
waterway here that's from a nearby

78
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,970
bauxite mine in this town here you can

79
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,400
see all the red so this is a road that

80
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,409
leads to bauxite mines there's trucks

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,790
that go by here every day and some of

82
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:40,260
the material falls off and you can see

83
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,120
all that reddish stuff so bauxite you

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,859
know the mining process itself is you

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,780
just it's pretty simple you dig it out

86
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,829
of the ground but of course a lot of it

87
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,579
somehow

88
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:53,190
runs off into the environment so they

89
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:57,030
crush the bauxite into sand sized pieces

90
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,370
and then they usually haul it on a barge

91
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,669
so they're filling up these ships here

92
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:07,440
and here there here are some barges with

93
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:08,790
bauxite sitting in in the bay there here

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,989
you can see the little piles of red

95
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:16,289
bauxite here's a big ship that's full of

96
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:19,829
bauxite inside and they haul it off to a

97
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:23,400
smelter ok so here's a smelter and it's

98
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,139
built near near a waterway like a bay or

99
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,420
something because they're expecting

100
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,150
these shipments of bauxite

101
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,410
a smelter is a plant that is going to

102
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:37,530
take that red bauxite material and split

103
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,540
it apart so that we have aluminum metal

104
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,730
okay so we're going to go from from

105
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,620
bauxite grains to pure metal that's what

106
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,990
a smelter does and we're going to talk

107
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:55,050
about the stages here so here's a

108
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:58,260
smelter right there and here's what

109
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,110
they're doing in there so the problem is

110
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,290
bauxite itself is a mixture of things

111
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:08,760
and they want to purify it to this pier

112
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,050
to a compound al2o3 so there is other

113
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,230
stuff mixed in there and they want to

114
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,490
get rid of it they want pure al2o3 so

115
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,560
what they do is they take the bauxite

116
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,600
remember it's been crushed up now and

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,090
they subjected to heat and pressure and

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,510
water and sodium hydroxide which is kind

119
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,270
of like Drano so it's a strong base and

120
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,640
they cook it and what happens is all the

121
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,730
stuff that's not al2o3

122
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,480
gets dissolved away and here's an image

123
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:38,370
of a smelter and you can see all these

124
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,540
smokestacks which tells you that there's

125
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,580
probably some air pollution being

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,070
produced here and this process is one of

127
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,140
the things that that produces some of

128
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,440
the pollution in this process but at the

129
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:53,880
end of all that you have al2o3 which we

130
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:57,660
also call alumina okay now after that

131
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,520
chemical separation we have a the

132
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,790
biggest problem of all which is that

133
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,040
what we want is pure aluminum al we

134
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,680
don't want the oxygen in there but we

135
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,480
don't have that we have al 2o3 and it

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,820
turns out that the bond between the

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,760
oxygen and the aluminum is very strong

138
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,610
so from chemistry if we draw out what al

139
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,930
2o3 looks like here's our aluminum we've

140
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,330
got these double bonds here on the

141
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,640
oxygen and we have to break those bonds

142
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:27,690
and it turns out it's very difficult to

143
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,790
do so the way that it's done is they mix

144
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,250
in this chemical cryolite which is

145
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,170
sodium aluminum fluoride which is itself

146
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,440
a pretty nasty chemical and they mix it

147
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:41,380
in with this al2o3 and they put it in

148
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,350
this big vat and then they run a very

149
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,970
strong electrical current through it

150
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:49,030
what'll happen is as the current runs

151
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,280
through this mixture the pure aluminum

152
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,250
that essentially it breaks the those

153
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,130
bonds those double oxygen bonds and it

154
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,100
the pure aluminum metal sinks to the

155
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,410
bottom as a liquid and then they come in

156
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,140
they extract that liquid from the bottom

157
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,200
of the VAT so this is what it looks like

158
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:12,400
so you can see this glowing reddish

159
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:15,730
color here these are the electrodes so

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,560
the VAT is below the ground electricity

161
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,410
the current is coming down through these

162
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,680
electrodes going down into below the

163
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,660
ground here and they're running hundreds

164
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,450
of thousands of amps through this

165
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,490
mixture and what floats two against

166
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,160
sinks to the bottom is the aluminum

167
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,430
metal and this thing is like a vacuum

168
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,960
cleaner and it's sucking up the

169
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,430
aluminium metal off the bottom that's

170
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,630
what they're doing and so what they'll

171
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,980
do is they'll just go down the line here

172
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,440
you can see these things all the way

173
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,800
down to the end of this building they're

174
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,950
all doing this this takes a lot of

175
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,710
electricity so each one of these vats

176
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,430
that you see here has a set of

177
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,980
electrodes

178
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,690
each of which is going through thousands

179
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,990
of amps so from what we talked about

180
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,850
before it's going through each one of

181
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,960
the each one of these is hundreds of

182
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,400
thousands of watts so this is another

183
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,830
picture what that looks like so here's

184
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:17,050
their aluminum sucker upper and here's

185
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:19,750
all that the VATS so it requires so much

186
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:23,350
electricity to do this that often in the

187
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,740
in the entrance of an aluminum smelter

188
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,920
you'll you'll see this huge network of

189
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,180
incoming power lines and sometimes they

190
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,039
need so much electricity that they

191
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,229
actually have their own power plant so

192
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,060
here is a smelter that's these are long

193
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,550
gate buildings in the background that's

194
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,229
the smelter and then this is a cold fire

195
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,500
power plant you can see there's the coal

196
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,390
piled up right there so this this

197
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,710
aluminum smelter needs so much

198
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,040
electricity that they actually have

199
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:53,230
their own coal-fired power plant

200
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,150
here's one in Eastern Washington that

201
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,010
has its own dam so there's the

202
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,280
smelter you see the elongate buildings

203
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,140
there's the hydroelectric dam so so

204
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,150
water is going through a turbine which

205
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,670
turns magnets which generates

206
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:11,230
electricity and so that's how they get

207
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,090
enough power to run the smelter so if we

208
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,480
add up the electricity that it would

209
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:19,690
take to develop a brand new aluminum can

210
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,060
from that bauxite mineral it turns out

211
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,790
it takes about 350 watt hours of energy

212
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,700
to make one aluminum can from scratch if

213
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,320
you instead recycle a can all they have

214
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,230
to do is melt it down they don't have to

215
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,770
split the aluminum oxygen bonds and it

216
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,770
takes about 5% of that so we can do some

217
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,600
math with this so it takes 350 watt

218
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:47,010
hours to make one aluminum can we could

219
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:54,610
ask questions like this so how much coal

220
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:56,950
would you need to make 12 cans all right

221
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,080
so we have a 12 pack of aluminum cans of

222
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,820
soda cans whatever and we want to know

223
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,110
how much coal did we have to burn to do

224
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,700
that so from last time these are the

225
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,980
we're going to use the same numbers as

226
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,050
last time you get your power and

227
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,060
kilowatt hours they're from kilowatt

228
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,160
hours you multiply that by two point two

229
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,650
for the pounds of coal or times a

230
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,230
thousand for the leaders of co2 etc all

231
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:27,700
the things that we did before so my

232
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:39,700
energy is 350 watt hours times I get 12

233
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:46,210
of them so I just take 350 times 12 and

234
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:48,100
get 4200 watt hours and to convert

235
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:56,590
that's kilowatt hours I divide by a

236
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:58,660
thousand and I get 4.2 kWh okay so

237
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,200
that's how much energy it takes to make

238
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:06,720
a 12-pack how much coal is that so let's

239
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:11,190
say I ask for coal in pounds

240
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,640
then all I have to do is take this 4.2

241
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:18,150
and multiply 2.2 pounds per

242
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,150
kilowatt-hour

243
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:34,060
and four point two times two point two

244
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:36,310
is nine point two four okay so it's

245
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,760
helped us nine point two four pounds of

246
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:45,640
coal to make a 12-pack of cans how much

247
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:48,460
co2 is that so I go back to my kilowatt

248
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,370
hours and multiply by a thousand and I

249
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,860
get four point two kilowatt hours times

250
00:11:51,370 --> 00:12:02,530
a thousand liters for every kilowatt

251
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:06,100
hour gives me 4200 liters of co2 okay so

252
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:09,390
that's what's required to make our cans

253
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:13,300
12-pack of cans so if I throw them away

254
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:15,040
then I've got to expend this much you'll

255
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,670
burn this much coal and produce this

256
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,680
much co2 to make another twelve but if I

257
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,660
recycle them they can just melt them

258
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,070
down and make new ones and it only takes

259
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:29,980
about 5% of that there's another set of

260
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,750
problems we can do we could say

261
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,900
something like this let's let's imagine

262
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:41,560
that I I've got a computer a little

263
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:44,410
laptop that uses 14 watts okay so

264
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:48,550
imagine pretty you know a fairly modern

265
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:51,040
small laptop and I want to know if I

266
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,810
took those twelve cans and I just threw

267
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,910
them away instead of recycling them I'm

268
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,320
throwing away energy right throwing away

269
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,920
the electricity that it would take

270
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,350
because I got to make 12 new cans how

271
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,930
long could I run a computer with that

272
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:13,320
electricity that I just threw away by

273
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,320
tossing those cans right so how long

274
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:35,660
could I run a computer on the

275
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:40,860
electricity it takes to make 12 new cans

276
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:42,330
okay so again the idea is if I throw a

277
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,210
lovely weekend away

278
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,030
I must not recycle it I got expend a

279
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:51,120
bunch of energy to make a new one so if

280
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:53,400
I had a 14 watt computer how long could

281
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,080
I use that computer how long could I run

282
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,850
it on 12 cans worth of energy so the

283
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,230
formula I'm going to use to figure this

284
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:09,480
out is the same one we've done before

285
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:11,430
energy is power times time okay so

286
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,280
what's my energy my energy is how much

287
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:18,540
energy it took to make 12 cans we just

288
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:25,410
solve that we said it was 4.2 kilowatt

289
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:29,640
hours and the power is 14 watts times

290
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:33,300
time we don't know what time is that's

291
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,950
what we're solving for so this is an

292
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,760
algebra problem where we're just going

293
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,350
to divide both sides and isolate time

294
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,560
but there's one step we have to do and

295
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:48,720
that is this we we did a conversion to

296
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:51,060
get watt hours to kilowatt hours so what

297
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,250
we have to do is get rid of that K

298
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,850
before we can do the math because we got

299
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,070
one hour

300
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,100
we got watts over here we're gonna have

301
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,950
times that in hours as an answer we got

302
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:06,030
to get rid of this K so I'm gonna go

303
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:09,780
back to what we had before this 4200

304
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,280
right here and I'm gonna put that in I'm

305
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,960
just kidding I'm just going backwards

306
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,400
multiple getting rid of stead of

307
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,230
dividing by a thousand multiplying a

308
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,140
thousand to get rid of the K just I'm

309
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:24,200
gonna write this out watt hours equals

310
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,200
14 watts times time

311
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:39,580
okay so now I'm going to divide both

312
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:50,320
sides by 14 Lots so I take 4200 divided

313
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:52,330
by 14 and I get 300 hours so so that

314
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,150
means I could turn that computer on and

315
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:59,050
leave it on continuously for 300 hours

316
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:03,610
on the electricity would take to make 12

317
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:09,300
new cans so we could even let's divide

318
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,300
that by 24 and that's 12 and a half days

319
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,010
so the point being that when we don't

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,810
recycle in the aluminum can we're

321
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:20,130
essentially throwing late electricity

322
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,130
that could be used for something else

323
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,560
okay so to recap the process if you mine

324
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,540
about 4 tons of bauxite the mineral and

325
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,580
then you run it through that chemical

326
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,680
digestion process you get about 2 tons

327
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,050
of alumina which is al2o3

328
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,760
you don't want al2o3 you want pure

329
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,620
aluminum and you run it through that

330
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,690
second process that that's the part that

331
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,490
takes all of the electricity and you get

332
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:47,050
one ton of actual aluminum metal so

333
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,890
because it takes a lot of electricity to

334
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,110
make cans

335
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,690
we'd like to recycle as many as possible

336
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:56,050
it turns out as a country we're really

337
00:16:52,690 --> 00:17:00,370
bad at doing this so here's an old old

338
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:04,480
graph that was published in 2002 and it

339
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:07,420
looks at how how many says thousands of

340
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,439
tons per year of lunar cans were thrown

341
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:13,240
away in the United States right so there

342
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,060
weren't really too many aluminum cans

343
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,360
before 1970 so the graph kind of starts

344
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,579
in 1970 and what we see is that as time

345
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,709
has gone on and as aluminum cans became

346
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:29,280
more and more popular we just threw more

347
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:31,810
and more of them away right so they they

348
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,780
calculated in this in again this is

349
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:37,960
where the year 2001 so in 1972 2001 that

350
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,749
16mm

351
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,379
tons of aluminum was just simply thrown

352
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:47,619
away over that time period and if you

353
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:51,190
look at a more modern records we really

354
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:56,019
have not gotten any better so here's I

355
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:59,559
from 96 to 2015 we're looking at how how

356
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:02,649
well we have recycled aluminum and so

357
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,649
there's a there's the blue line in a red

358
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:10,539
line for industry and consumers but the

359
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:12,820
point is is here's a 50% mark right so

360
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,529
we are recycling a little bit better

361
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,869
than half of the cans and then you can

362
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:18,639
see it dips back down again and then it

363
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:21,789
gets better so the red line you can

364
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:24,610
imagine that's us as consumers and it's

365
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:27,669
hovering around the 50% mark so in other

366
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:30,909
words we pretty much throw away about

367
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:33,070
half of our aluminum cans and when I

368
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,470
teach this cost face to face usually in

369
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,269
a college classroom I will go over to

370
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,369
the garbage can at this point and I'll

371
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:41,559
open it and I guarantee there are

372
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:43,119
aluminum cans in the trash and right

373
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,460
next to the trash was usually a

374
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,710
recycling bin so in other words it's not

375
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,080
even it doesn't even require any effort

376
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:56,710
to do the recycling people simply just

377
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:59,740
don't care back to that 2002 paper they

378
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,960
were they were looking at again they're

379
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:07,090
calculating how many aluminum cans were

380
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:09,249
wasted from 1972 in this case to 2000 so

381
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:12,399
there's a couple interesting numbers

382
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:15,039
here one is how much electricity

383
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:17,649
did we throw away it says exactly half

384
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,289
of all US homes for one year so in other

385
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:22,809
words we could power half of it all the

386
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,399
homes in the United States for a year on

387
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:27,850
the electricity that we threw away

388
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:30,100
essentially from aluminum cans alone or

389
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,779
you can do equivalent that's equivalent

390
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:37,059
is fifteen thousand seven hundred ninety

391
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:39,340
six million gallons of gasoline are 342

392
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,529
million barrels of oil that's how much

393
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:46,240
an energy equivalent that we threw away

394
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:48,279
during that time period so a couple more

395
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,289
statistics every six months we throw

396
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,760
away enough aluminum to rebuild the

397
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,340
world supply of commercial

398
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,550
planes so airplanes are made of aluminum

399
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,200
because aluminum is very light so every

400
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,150
six months we could just replace all the

401
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,370
commercial airlines and airplanes in the

402
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,670
world based on the amount of cans that

403
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,290
we throw away the electricity that we

404
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,240
could save each year by recycling the

405
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,160
throwing away cans would would be enough

406
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,160
electricity to power three million US

407
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,350
homes so three million houses we could

408
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,160
power each year just on the cans or

409
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:23,200
chucking so when we make new cans

410
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,930
remember it takes 350 watt hours per can

411
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,520
plus you've got the bauxite mining and

412
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,840
all the runoff from that you've got the

413
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,140
air pollution from the chemical

414
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,600
digestion process all the greenhouse

415
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,200
gases that we're making all those things

416
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,870
count so why do we recycle cans not

417
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,630
because aluminum is rare because it's

418
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:47,760
not because it takes so much electricity

419
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,760
to make it can that's why
