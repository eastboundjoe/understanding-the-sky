1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,260
hey this is Mel strong and in this

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,880
lecture we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,790
renewable energy

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,859
so the first source of renewable energy

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,500
we're going to talk about is the Sun and

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,090
so we're going to talk about how we

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,880
might be able to use the Sun to generate

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,539
electricity or how to harness the Sun

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,060
for other things so in the previous

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,130
lecture we talked about how electricity

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,989
is generated and we talked about the

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,570
steam turbine and we said that there is

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,840
this apparatus that's got a bunch of

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,480
looks like fan blades and steam comes in

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,840
and pushes these blades and this entire

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:51,239
thing spins and as it spins it turns a

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,250
magnetic field in circles and that's

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,070
next to a conductor generates

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,879
electricity and so last time we talked

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,160
about well what would make steam and and

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,019
around most of the world the way this is

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,820
done is we burn fossil fuels that

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,470
generates heat that boils water that

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:13,320
makes steam so could we use the Sun to

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,290
make steam and this is one thing that

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,119
could be done is if you can imagine if

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,590
you could concentrate the heat of the

28
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,869
Sun to boil water then you could use a

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,520
steam turbine in the in the entire

30
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,430
apparatus that we talked about before

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,470
for generating electricity except

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,750
instead of burning coal we can use this

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,600
Sun so here we've got a bunch of

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,110
parabolic mirrors and in the center of

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,479
the mirror the other is a glass tube and

36
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:46,590
the Sun is being reflected to the center

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,590
of these tubes and inside the tube is a

38
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,170
fluid that gets heated to way beyond the

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,780
boiling point of water and then it gets

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,710
piped over to this in the background

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,299
there's a steam turbine over here and

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:03,270
just like in the coal-fired power plant

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,430
the boils water makes steam towards a

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,030
turbine turns magnets and generates

45
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,759
electricity

46
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,239
now the flue that they use a lot of

47
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,040
times is salt not salt water just

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,560
actually pure salt

49
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,360
and if you heat up salt thousands of

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,640
degrees it will melt and act like a

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,680
fluid and so that's what they actually

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,799
use for most of these is their salt

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,540
that's so hot it's molten and it flows

54
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,459
in these glass tubes and again you can

55
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,010
see there's the the generator in the

56
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:37,049
background there so here is a an

57
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,480
installation and and by the way this is

58
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:41,459
called concentrated solar power that's

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,980
the term that's used for this kind of

60
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,470
technology so you have rows and rows of

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,829
these parabolic reflectors with a little

62
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:53,010
glass tube in the center with melting

63
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:56,670
salt and all of this is sent over to the

64
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,000
power plant that's over here now one of

65
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,579
the advantages of using this

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,310
concentrated solar power is that that

67
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,799
salt gets so hot that it actually stays

68
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,540
hot overnight and it will continue to

69
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,730
generate steam overnight so this is a

70
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,470
solar power technology that generates

71
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,060
electricity in the dark because it gets

72
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,099
so hot during the day and it retains as

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,040
heat throughout the night here's another

74
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:23,459
version of it Sandia Labs is actually

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,459
working been working on this these are

76
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,590
mirrors and they all reflect the Sun to

77
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,660
this capsule and this capsule is

78
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,079
something called a Stirling engine it's

79
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,699
a heat powered engine and so as one side

80
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,040
of this is hot and the other side is

81
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,019
cooler it that temperature difference

82
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,849
will will cause this little engine to

83
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,209
run and they can generate electricity

84
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:48,000
that way here's another version of that

85
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,590
there's a parabolic mirror and again one

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,730
of those Stirling engines that's a

87
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,590
generating electricity on the end here

88
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,629
here's an installation and I think this

89
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,780
is in Australia where they have several

90
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:04,079
of these dishes and you can kind of get

91
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,430
a sense there this one is glowing you

92
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,109
know it's pretty hot on one side there

93
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,659
as is this one and and apparently these

94
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,669
these dishes so they track the Sun so

95
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,760
they're always reflecting the Sun to

96
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,470
this Stirling engine that's enough to

97
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,700
generate generates enough electricity

98
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:26,430
for a small town and this is not a new

99
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,930
idea so here's one from 1901 this is a

100
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,509
solar-powered steam engine

101
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,199
and so it's the same idea that you've

102
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:38,690
got parabolic mirrors that are blowing

103
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:41,009
water here that makes steam and turns a

104
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,650
probably a piston on this one instead of

105
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:46,610
a turbine but this is a solar-powered

106
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:50,639
steam engines this is an old idea but

107
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,320
this is very expensive to make and coal

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,639
is super cheap so these really didn't

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,080
catch on because why would you go

110
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,940
through the expense of building all this

111
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,340
because you're gonna shovel coal for

112
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,169
next to nothing and you don't need to

113
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,280
deal with all that so these really never

114
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:07,370
caught on another version of this is

115
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,800
sometimes called the Tower of Power and

116
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,889
there's these are all mirrors down here

117
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,539
and the mirrors are on a tracking system

118
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,850
so they're tracking the Sun and they're

119
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:21,300
always reflecting the Sun so that it

120
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,120
lands on this capsule up here which is

121
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,550
at the top of this tower and inside that

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,199
capsule is molten salt so it works just

123
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,120
like the ones I've been talking about

124
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,849
the first ones with the parabolic

125
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,180
mirrors with molten salt it's just that

126
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:39,470
this version the mirrors are moving and

127
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,669
reflecting the Sun to this one spot

128
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,710
here's one that's in Nevada

129
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:47,310
that's just recently come on the line

130
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,229
and it gets so hot that this the top of

131
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,210
this tower glows pretty brightly like

132
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,010
you can't even look at it and there

133
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,380
there's been some complaints actually of

134
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:59,250
pilots that are flying in the area that

135
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:02,580
say it's too bright to look at now there

136
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,979
another one again you can see the the

137
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,190
capsule appear glowing in all these

138
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,949
mirrors tracking the Sun reflecting it

139
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,530
onto that one spot and again the big

140
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,960
advantage here is that you can use steam

141
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,090
turbine technology CDs so that's all the

142
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,010
same from coal-fired power plants and it

143
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,990
gets so hot during the day it'll

144
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,300
continue to generate electricity during

145
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,400
the night

146
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,990
here's one from above so you can see all

147
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,500
these mirrors it's kind of like they're

148
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,800
all worshiping their leader that's in

149
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,330
the center here or this one a lot of

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,219
these pictures are from Europe these are

151
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,500
more popular in Europe than they are in

152
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,400
the United States because they're very

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,190
expensive too

154
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,690
so mostly only the countries that don't

155
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,210
have a lot of fossil fuels have been

156
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,020
investing in this we only have a couple

157
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:56,449
of them so far so here's two of them and

158
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,449
there's one tower there one tower there

159
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,110
so inside this system we're not going to

160
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,120
go too deep here but here's the mirrors

161
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,030
here's that capsule that gets white-hot

162
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,800
and inside there is molten salt and the

163
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,729
molten salt goes through kind of a loop

164
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,860
or exchanges heat with the water so this

165
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:19,139
part is what's boiling the water with

166
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,930
that molten salt and then it goes into

167
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,720
this turbine that's what this is so the

168
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,910
fan blades and and then that turns the

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,889
generator that's this part and then that

170
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,570
generates the electricity and then

171
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,389
there's a cooling system for the turbine

172
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:37,380
and that's what this part is but okay

173
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:40,560
now there's another way that we can

174
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,500
harness the heat of the Sun to help save

175
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,840
electricity and one is you could have a

176
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,289
couple panels on your roof that help

177
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,180
heat water so usually what happens is so

178
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,820
every house has a water heater it might

179
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,669
be gas might be electric and normally

180
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,280
cold water from the ground goes into the

181
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:01,320
tank so here here's the tank and then

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,190
you've got electricity or natural gas

183
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,580
that heats that water up to you know 140

184
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:12,300
degrees or whatever it is so what a

185
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,340
water a preheater for your water heater

186
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,919
does is the cold water coming from the

187
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,590
ground moves through these boxes and in

188
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,620
these boxes are just some pipes that are

189
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,050
sitting in the Sun and it pre heats the

190
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,380
water before it goes into the water

191
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,860
heater so if the ground water is say 40

192
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,719
degrees and so normally without without

193
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,209
this system you'd have 40 degree water

194
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,450
going into your water heater and having

195
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:41,610
to warm that up from 40 to 140 let's say

196
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,919
you might run it through these pre

197
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,339
heaters these solar pre heaters and it

198
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,010
might warm it from 40 maybe to 80 or 90

199
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,350
so then you've got 90 degree water going

200
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:55,000
in and you have to warm 90 degree water

201
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,610
to 140 which doesn't take you

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,300
as much energy so this is what these

203
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,370
look like

204
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,110
so again inside they're just some pipes

205
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,620
so they're pretty simple there's no

206
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,589
really any moving parts no electricity

207
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,029
it's just using heat from the Sun

208
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,860
another thing that people can do is they

209
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,519
can use the Sun to actually heat the air

210
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,709
and so Sun hits this collector and

211
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,259
inside this box gets very warm and

212
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,930
there's a system that vents the warm air

213
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,980
into the house so here's an example or

214
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,689
there's one that put it on your roof

215
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,939
it's pretty simple there's just a fan

216
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:31,810
that blows air from inside the house

217
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:34,629
into this glass box and then that warms

218
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,810
up and then and then the fan pushes it

219
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:43,560
out and it just sits there all day and

220
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:48,310
helps heat your house and other version

221
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,680
okay so everything we've talked about so

222
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,600
far is using the heat of the Sun to

223
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,829
either generate electricity or help save

224
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,589
electricity but the big technology that

225
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,649
everybody has been using especially in

226
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:05,680
this country to generate electricity is

227
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:09,670
that a photovoltaic cells a photovoltaic

228
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,899
cell means you use the Sun the photo to

229
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,459
generate electricity volts photovoltaic

230
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,110
now how these work is pretty complicated

231
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,350
we're not going to get into it but it

232
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,180
uses semiconductors there's three layers

233
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,439
of semiconductors which is mostly

234
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:29,110
silicon except doped with a tiny amount

235
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:30,519
of something else okay and we're not

236
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,100
going to get into it except to say that

237
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,019
when you have sandwiched layers of

238
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,839
silicon doped with other materials and

239
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:40,149
the light hits it electrons will be

240
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,360
pushed from one side and tried to get to

241
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:45,189
the other side so before we took a

242
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,959
magnet and we moved it next to a

243
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:49,899
conductor and that made the electrons

244
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,480
move here what's happening is with these

245
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,410
three layers of semiconductors mostly

246
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,269
silicon hit with photons of light

247
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,220
electrons will try to move through this

248
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:06,370
circuit that's all we really need to

249
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:08,590
know here so it's kind of similar to an

250
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,200
LED light so you think back

251
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,080
last lecture we talked about LEDs light

252
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,580
emitting diodes and we use them as light

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,980
and they were these these little square

254
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,230
wafers that when you put a voltage on

255
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,420
them it makes a light it's the same kind

256
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,560
of process but in Reverse you hit it

257
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:30,340
with a light turns into a voltage so

258
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:32,200
each little solar cell might be that you

259
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,840
put in your hand for the most part and

260
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,180
they're not very powerful so you put

261
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,760
that thing in the Sun you'll make a very

262
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,560
small but measurable non electricity but

263
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,030
you can't really power anything

264
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,820
important with it you could not power a

265
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,440
house with this for example you might be

266
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,380
able to power like a little tiny light

267
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,540
or something so what we do is we wire a

268
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,720
whole bunch of these solar cells

269
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:58,360
together and there's different

270
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,420
terminology but these if you put a whole

271
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,550
bunch of these together into this calls

272
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,470
it a module or you might call it a panel

273
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,490
and you know take a bunch of these

274
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:13,000
modules together to make an array and

275
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:15,550
the word these words are kind of fuzzy

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,430
because this might be called a module or

277
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:23,110
panel this thing here might be called a

278
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:25,420
module or an array and then if you wire

279
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,610
a bunch of these together that's also

280
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,940
sometimes called an array not too

281
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,710
worried about the terminology but here's

282
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,900
a whole bunch of them together so each

283
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,780
one of these little squares is a solar

284
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,600
cell and then each one of these might be

285
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,210
called a module or a panel and then all

286
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,130
together all of these together usually

287
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:49,510
call on the Ray or sometimes a solar

288
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:52,000
farm so all the solar cells in this in

289
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,280
this diagram are all working together to

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,680
generate electricity enough to actually

291
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,510
do something useful so as I can armie a

292
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,070
Smurf's like one a little Smurf doesn't

293
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,810
do anything but you get like a million

294
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,250
of them and they can do something that's

295
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,100
kind of what they're doing with solar

296
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,660
here's another example right so you know

297
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,970
there's hundreds of thousands of

298
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,910
individual solar cells all working in

299
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:16,300
unison to try to generate electricity

300
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,760
now sometimes they are on trackers

301
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,470
that's the most efficient way so what

302
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,180
that means is they're following the Sun

303
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,060
so they're always getting the maximum

304
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,580
sunlight trackers are very expensive

305
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,260
okay so these ones I showed you in the

306
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,540
past they don't have any tracking system

307
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,440
they're just pointed in one direction

308
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,440
generally you just point them towards

309
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,290
the south part of the sky these are on

310
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,149
trackers as are these so they will move

311
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,190
throughout the day and that gives you

312
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:46,390
the most energy but again it's the most

313
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:49,120
expensive well at U and M on the main

314
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:52,540
campus we actually have a couple of

315
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,850
arrays so if you park on campus there's

316
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,070
the Yale parking structure so right here

317
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,709
that's Lomas and the hospital is kind of

318
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:04,270
off the it's up in the corner off the

319
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:07,330
diagram here but on the top of the Yale

320
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:11,160
parking structure are a series of solar

321
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:14,260
panels it's rated at the 180 kilowatt

322
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,779
180,000 Watts okay so that's how much

323
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,760
power is being generated when the Sun is

324
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,399
directly shining on it this is what it

325
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,130
looks like up close and you can actually

326
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,970
park your car underneath these solar

327
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,380
panels also on the science and math

328
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,660
learning center building there is

329
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,370
another array that's not quite as big

330
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,020
but here's what that looks like I'm just

331
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:40,630
using Google Earth to look down on these

332
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,570
you can also get you can put a solar

333
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,520
array on your house so a lot of you know

334
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,640
if your house is oriented in the right

335
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,200
direction like if this is a south-facing

336
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:56,830
roof then that's a convenient spot to

337
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:59,380
put solar panels or like these so it

338
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:02,170
used to be that solar panels were so

339
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,390
expensive that you rarely ever saw a

340
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,270
house with that with with solar panels

341
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,410
with photovoltaic cells now they've been

342
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,529
getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper

343
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,300
too now you're starting to see this more

344
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,779
and more as a more and more common thing

345
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,640
so let's say you wanted to convert your

346
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,130
house to solar there's a couple

347
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,610
different ways to do it the easy way to

348
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:26,589
do it is let's say you live in a city

349
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,570
like Albuquerque and you're connected to

350
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,839
what we call the grid so normal

351
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:34,209
electricity right so the easiest way to

352
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,180
do this is you invest in solar panels

353
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:36,710
and you invest in

354
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,390
thing called an inverter and what the

355
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,940
inverter does is it converts the

356
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:43,280
electricity from the solar panels to

357
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,610
something that the electric company

358
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,530
could actually use and so if you live in

359
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,050
certain cities in Albuquerque's one of

360
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,060
them our local power company in this

361
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,890
case PNM is required to buy that

362
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,230
electricity from you during the day so

363
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,790
you got solar panels on your roof but

364
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,340
you're not home and you're not using an

365
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,720
electricity you can sell it to the

366
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,260
electric company during the day and they

367
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,140
pay you per kilowatt hour now Sun Goes

368
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,820
Down your home you need electricity your

369
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,060
solar panels are not working during the

370
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,640
night you buy electricity back from the

371
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,830
power company so the idea here is you

372
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,840
sell it to rent you sell it to them

373
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,820
during the day you buy it from them

374
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,800
during the night and hopefully you

375
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,570
either break even or if you have a lot

376
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,820
of solar panels you might even make a

377
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,530
little money doing this so people that

378
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,420
have a lot of solar panels on the roof

379
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,130
are actually generating a little income

380
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,500
each month if they're selling more than

381
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,790
they're using so this is what the yell

382
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,780
parking structure at UNM does they

383
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,330
during the day they're generating

384
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:47,630
electricity they're selling it to PNM

385
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:50,120
then at night the whole parking

386
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,610
structure is lit up and they have to buy

387
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,500
electricity back from PNM and they hope

388
00:16:52,610 --> 00:17:00,620
that they break even now if you're not

389
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,450
connected to the grid let's say you want

390
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,910
a solar power house out in the boonies

391
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,440
or you live in a town where the electric

392
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,780
company will not buy your electricity

393
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,150
gets a lot more complicated because what

394
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,530
are you gonna do at night and what you

395
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,560
have to do is you have to have a big

396
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,970
bank of batteries and if you use the

397
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,090
amount of electricity that most

398
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,860
Americans do you really need a lot of

399
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:26,120
batteries to store that much electricity

400
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:28,400
so during the day your solar cells your

401
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,650
solar panels would be charging a

402
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,050
enormous Bank of batteries like what's

403
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:36,470
shown in this picture and then at night

404
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:40,250
you are using the electricity from those

405
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,500
batteries now how this would work is

406
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,450
your solar panels go to something called

407
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,740
a charge controller which charged the

408
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,260
batteries right so during the day is

409
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,860
charging the batteries then at night the

410
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,570
batteries

411
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,720
go to something called an inverter which

412
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,679
takes the voltage of the batteries and

413
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,350
converts it to something that your

414
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,880
standard 110 volt thing can could use

415
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,610
that's what an inverter does and that

416
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,130
powers the house one of this advantages

417
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:07,190
of doing this is well what happens if

418
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,440
you get say a cloudy day or two cloudy

419
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,120
days in a row or you think about those

420
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,230
mid-latitude cyclones if you live in

421
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,110
that part of the country you might have

422
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,460
five cloudy days in a row you're in

423
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,500
trouble because you don't have any way

424
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,289
generating electricity during the day so

425
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,510
a lot of people that live this way also

426
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:28,490
have like a backup generator or maybe

427
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:30,649
some wind turbines to help out one thing

428
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,529
that a lot of people don't realize is

429
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:36,169
that solar cells are not entirely green

430
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,600
and so they work very similar to

431
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:41,059
computer chips there are silicon wafers

432
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,220
as we talked about that's a very messy

433
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,649
process it takes a lot of chemicals that

434
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,549
generates a lot of waste uses a lot of

435
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:51,169
electricity so a lot of our solar cells

436
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:54,019
or solar panels are coming from China

437
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:55,850
and China doesn't have the pollution

438
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:57,289
controls that we do and we've talked

439
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,080
about how terrible the air quality in

440
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,519
China is a lot of that at least a

441
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,690
portion of it is coming from the

442
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,549
manufacture of solar panels so it's not

443
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,899
entirely green it takes a lot of energy

444
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:11,630
to make them and that makes a lot of

445
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:13,940
pollution once you have them yeah they

446
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,880
will continue making clean energy as

447
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:21,289
long as they still are around but the

448
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:24,710
manufacturing process is pretty dirty so

449
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:26,510
if we look at a map of well so this one

450
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,210
says photovoltaics all the solar

451
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:32,210
resources of the United States where

452
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:36,019
would you go to generate the most solar

453
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:38,899
electricity and probably not surprising

454
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:41,990
but we New Mexico and Arizona Southern

455
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:44,120
California have the most hours of

456
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,269
sunlight per year now you can actually

457
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,250
see the pattern here that is the effect

458
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,559
of the Pacific subtropical high again

459
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,510
right so remember we've got that sinking

460
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,059
air from the Hadley cell keeps it very

461
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,380
dry in this part of the country

462
00:19:55,059 --> 00:20:01,610
therefore we have many hours of

463
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,510
available sunlight so almost all in New

464
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,000
Mexico's Cape

465
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:08,330
generating at least six kilowatt hours

466
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,400
per square meter per day right so if you

467
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,080
had enough solar panels out there you

468
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,990
could generate six kilowatt hours for

469
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:20,030
every square meter so pros and cons then

470
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:23,000
once you have the solar panel made 100%

471
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:26,360
free of greenhouse gases right doesn't

472
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,810
make any noise doesn't produce any air

473
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,510
pollution cons they've been very

474
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,170
expensive to make but in recent years

475
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,670
they've become much much cheaper

476
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:40,850
photovoltaic cells only work during the

477
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:43,340
day so storage is a problem unless

478
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,590
you're connected to the grid of course

479
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,870
if you're using the molten-salt you know

480
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,970
that concentrated solar power those

481
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,990
things I can work all night because they

482
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:55,700
you just get so hot can be used in all

483
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,560
parts of the world right if you live up

484
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,540
in the middle of Canada in the winter

485
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,710
good luck you're not going to have any

486
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:05,090
sunlight the manufacturing processes

487
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,490
manufacturing process is messy and

488
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:12,980
consumes energy so it's not completely

489
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:15,020
free of carbon right so so without

490
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,430
turning things political you can't avoid

491
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,000
some of the politics that have been

492
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:22,360
going on about solar so our current

493
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,480
administration the Trump administration

494
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,610
has been very anti solar for the most

495
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,500
part so for example our current EPA

496
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,150
chief Scott Pruett as soon as he got in

497
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,390
office he said he's going to get rid of

498
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:38,420
the solar tax credits which are designed

499
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:43,340
to help homeowners get solar panels on

500
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:48,290
their roof there was a tax bill that was

501
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:52,520
passed end of 2017 that got rid of a lot

502
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:57,320
of the tax credits for solar and also

503
00:21:52,520 --> 00:22:02,510
also when energy and then earlier this

504
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:05,780
year Trump put some tariffs on imported

505
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,670
solar panels so the back story here is

506
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,160
that China has been cranking out lots

507
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,440
and lots of solar panels and they've

508
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,000
been able to produce them cheaper than

509
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,190
the American companies have been able to

510
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,899
make them so the

511
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:21,200
system that we have that's been in place

512
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:23,029
for the last five to ten years that

513
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,460
China has been making the solar panels

514
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:29,059
then American companies buy them and

515
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,940
install them in the u.s. so Trump

516
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:34,730
decided that he was going to put tariffs

517
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,259
on the Chinese solar panels so that

518
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,200
American companies might be able to

519
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:41,750
compete in in making them which sounds

520
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,340
like a good idea except what that ends

521
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,409
up meaning is that they're so expensive

522
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,240
that that nobody here is really buying

523
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:50,210
them to put on their houses anymore

524
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,100
so the actual solar industry is taking a

525
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,679
big hit because these tariffs and we

526
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,730
just don't have the manufacturing

527
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,740
capacity at the moment now maybe we'll

528
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,080
build it in the future but right now

529
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,480
this is this has taken a big chunk out

530
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:08,090
of the solar power industry in this

531
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:11,740
country there's a whole history of solar

532
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,870
panels in the White House so back in

533
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,789
late 70s Jimmy Carter that guy was our

534
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,220
president and he decided that he would

535
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:21,139
have solar panels installed on the White

536
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,659
House okay so that he was kind of this

537
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:26,720
progressive alternative energy kind of

538
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:28,490
guy so then a few years later we have

539
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,539
Ronald Reagan who was very anti

540
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,600
alternative energy

541
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:34,279
he had them taken down and then fast

542
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,919
forward a couple administrations and

543
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:39,529
Obama comes along and puts them back up

544
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,509
except there they're different the solar

545
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:44,210
panels at Jimmy Carter had were for

546
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:46,429
heating water Obama solar panels were

547
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,110
for generating electricity then Trump

548
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,820
gets in the office and says he wants to

549
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,129
take the solar panels back down again

550
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,200
but as of right now he hasn't done that

551
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:56,840
yet so that's the kind of ridiculous

552
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,600
thing we're into that it's turned into

553
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,700
the stupid political argument where if

554
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,860
you're a Democrat you're Pro solar if

555
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,049
you're Republican you're anti solar and

556
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,679
it's just dumb the whole thing is just

557
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:12,440
dumb okay so there are some calculations

558
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,570
that we can do with solar so let's say

559
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,759
I've got some solar panels on my roof

560
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,730
let's say I just have eight panels and

561
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,100
each one is rated at a hundred watts so

562
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:25,730
when you buy a solar panel they're rated

563
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:28,909
in their power in wattage and let's say

564
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,149
that the way that my house is situated I

565
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:37,049
get

566
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:39,689
say 12 hours of sunlight a day and we'll

567
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,909
just for simplicity we'll just say let's

568
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:45,749
imagine it's 12 hours all throughout the

569
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:47,189
year okay so and we're going to assume

570
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:48,539
that we're in direct sunlight so that

571
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:51,319
each one of these is getting the full

572
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:55,229
hundred watts so my question might be

573
00:24:51,319 --> 00:25:03,449
say how much energy do I generate in a

574
00:24:55,229 --> 00:25:06,119
year okay so that's the question how

575
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:08,759
much energy do I generate in a year and

576
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,169
where we're headed for this is let's say

577
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,059
in if you know the assumption here is

578
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:14,969
I'm using that energy instead of burning

579
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:17,489
coal to generate that electricity how

580
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:19,969
much coal do I save how much co2 do I

581
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:23,699
save okay that's where we're headed so

582
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:26,519
let's do what's calculate energy and

583
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:30,589
we're gonna use the same formula that we

584
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:33,329
did before energy is power times time

585
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:37,499
okay so we don't know this this is what

586
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:39,089
we're solving for and let's see what's

587
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:46,039
the power well each one is a hundred

588
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:53,519
watts but we've got eight of them and

589
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:56,969
the time is 12 hours a day times 365

590
00:25:53,519 --> 00:26:03,149
days a year okay so this is gonna be our

591
00:25:56,969 --> 00:26:10,709
calculation so I have a hundred times

592
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:16,369
eight times 12 times 365 so I get three

593
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:25,139
million five hundred and four thousand

594
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:27,869
watts times hours watt hours right we're

595
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:31,699
going to convert this a kWh so I'm gonna

596
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:36,239
divide by a thousand and that gets me

597
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:40,769
3504 kilowatt hours so that's how much

598
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:42,869
energy I have generated on my roof with

599
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:44,720
my solar panels okay so this is what

600
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:48,060
I've generated

601
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,450
okay so a question could be well how

602
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,510
much coal did I save from burning how

603
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,300
much coal did I not have to burn right

604
00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:05,850
so remember it's and we'll do in pounds

605
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:07,740
so coal saved is this if I if this is a

606
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,630
question and we had we had the gin we

607
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,090
had to burn coal to do this we would

608
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:16,980
multiply this by 2.2 so it's the same

609
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:22,500
kind of question so 3504 kilowatt hours

610
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:28,110
and it takes 2.2 pounds for every

611
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:37,370
kilowatt hour so that gives me something

612
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:52,620
to divide by a thousand times 2.2 77090

613
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:55,200
of coal saved okay so I say I prevent

614
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,810
from you know that simple eight panel

615
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,020
array on my roof prevents 7800 pounds of

616
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:04,230
coal from being burned each year how

617
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,590
much co2 do I prevent from emitting into

618
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:11,610
the atmosphere I would go back to my

619
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:19,350
3500 for let's say I asked this in

620
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:22,590
liters liters of co2 saved prevented

621
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:28,440
from going into the atmosphere 3504

622
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:31,560
kilowatt hours and it's a thousand

623
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,010
liters of co2 for every one kilowatt

624
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,570
hour that I burned so I get the number

625
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:43,830
three million five hundred four thousand

626
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:47,810
liters of co2 that are saved or

627
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:50,130
prevented from going into the atmosphere

628
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:53,090
okay so we can do calculations like this

629
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,350
is the same math that we've seen before

630
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,600
okay we'll do another version of this

631
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,419
type of problem now let's say I've

632
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,710
got a big solar array on the roof say at

633
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:06,539
UNM and it's rated at 35 kilowatts and

634
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:15,059
let's say the building is situated so it

635
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:18,419
gets 10 hours of sunlight a day and I

636
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:26,070
want to know let's say in a month in 30

637
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:29,250
days how much coal does this save from

638
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:35,070
being burned right so how much coal do

639
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:46,350
we save with this solar array so energy

640
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:49,080
is power times time again now here's

641
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:52,350
this case so we had to deal with this in

642
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:56,909
the aluminum problem sometimes it's best

643
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:59,039
to get rid of the K in work out the

644
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:00,900
problem and then convert to kilowatt

645
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,770
hours at the end so here's what I mean

646
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,600
by that K means a thousand right so 35

647
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:13,350
kilowatts is the same thing as

648
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:20,159
thirty-five thousand watts times 10

649
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:28,620
hours times 30 days so I'm going to do

650
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:37,280
that math and I have 35 thousand times

651
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:37,280
10 times 30 let's see here so I get

652
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:53,910
ten million five hundred thousand watt

653
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,800
hours generated in a month and now what

654
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,800
I'm gonna do is divide by a thousand to

655
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:02,190
turn it into kilowatt hours which gives

656
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:13,290
me ten thousand five hundred kilowatt

657
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:14,880
hours kWh in a month so with that I can

658
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,970
then figure out okay well how much cold

659
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,490
would I need multiply that by two point

660
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:25,950
two so I take ten thousand five hundred

661
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:30,330
times two point two and I get twenty

662
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:35,520
three thousand one hundred pounds of

663
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:38,880
coal in a month that I saved from this

664
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,820
solar array so as the same math as

665
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,850
before the only tricky part with some

666
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,130
people is not knowing what to do with

667
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:51,660
the K if I when the Razr

668
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:54,840
is reported as K no kilowatts my

669
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,690
recommendation is replace K with

670
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,090
multiply this by thousand which is what

671
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,100
I did here and then do the math and then

672
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:04,680
when you get to watt hours divide by a

673
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,640
thousand to turn it into kWh not the

674
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,730
only way to do it

675
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,550
so if you you feel math competent you

676
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,550
know what's going on do it your own way

677
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:17,670
but this is kind of a foolproof way of

678
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:20,310
working through it each time so the

679
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,270
other source of renewable energy is that

680
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,000
of wind power

681
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:27,420
so when turbines are these big wind

682
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,510
mills that as they spin they turn

683
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,520
magnets near conductor at the generate

684
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:36,150
electricity in a similar way that a

685
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,070
steam turbine works so if you kind of

686
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,440
look inside there's this big white box

687
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:44,700
that sits behind the blades and inside

688
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:49,550
there there's a device that takes the

689
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,980
very slow spinning of the blades and

690
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:55,170
makes it spin faster gears it up so that

691
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,480
you can spin magnets near a conductor

692
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:01,919
pretty quickly and generate

693
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:04,980
tricity the blades themselves they can

694
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,899
turn that they can change the pitch so

695
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,610
if it's a little bit of wind there'll be

696
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,740
a certain position if there's a lot of

697
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,240
wind there'll be a different position

698
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,370
but they're always trying to turn is

699
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,159
about the same speed no matter what the

700
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,779
wind conditions are so inside of one

701
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,269
this is kind of what it looks like going

702
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:24,659
up the tower and here we are in the box

703
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:27,899
behind those blades so this is the

704
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:30,000
device that gears takes the very slow

705
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:32,340
rotation and gears it up so it's

706
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
spinning pretty quickly and then

707
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:39,360
electricity comes out the other end here

708
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,950
or the generator is so windmills are

709
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,889
great when turbines are great because

710
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:47,279
they they do as long as they're running

711
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:48,750
they generate no greenhouse gases and in

712
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,889
a lot of places if it's windy it might

713
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,070
be windy every day you're getting

714
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:55,289
electricity every day but there is a

715
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,730
public backlash against wind turbines

716
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:59,340
that just like there's been a public

717
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,080
backlash against solar so here are some

718
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,240
of the big issues

719
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,580
some people think they're just ugly and

720
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,520
they ruin the landscape okay though

721
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,050
people don't like to look at them there

722
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,960
have been complaints especially in the

723
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,760
past that they're noisy people live near

724
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,859
them say they you know they can't sleep

725
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,950
they hear them all the time and also

726
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:22,349
they used to kill birds so the early

727
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,000
designs spun really fast and the birds

728
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:27,060
would not see the blades and they'd run

729
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,929
right into it and die so these problems

730
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:34,319
have for the most part been addressed so

731
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:36,240
talking about sound first you know

732
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:39,000
California was one of the first states

733
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,589
to really adopt wind technology and they

734
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
did a lot of experimentation in

735
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:44,069
California with different windmill

736
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,659
designs and it's true the first ones

737
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:47,790
were really noisy they spun really fast

738
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,230
they made a lot of noise so they

739
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:53,069
experimented with some different designs

740
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,960
here's a two blade design here's a one

741
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:56,520
blade design which looks kind of funny

742
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,190
it's got a counterweight on the other

743
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,510
side so it doesn't shake itself apart

744
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,760
remember they were experimenting trying

745
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,980
to make the quietest windmill that they

746
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,319
could here's what we call the eggbeater

747
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,180
design it spins vertically around an

748
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,430
axis this way

749
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:15,559
here's smaller version

750
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:18,540
these vertical axis wind turbines and

751
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:22,369
through trial and error eventually they

752
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:25,619
settled on a design of three blades and

753
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:27,869
they've managed over time to build these

754
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:31,980
larger and larger which means that the

755
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:33,869
blades can actually spend slower and if

756
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,450
you have a blade that's spinning slower

757
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:39,660
it doesn't make as much noise and the

758
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:42,000
birds see it and they don't die so this

759
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:45,420
three by two design is what all the wind

760
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,859
wind turbines now are designed after you

761
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,980
also notice they have a really small

762
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:52,530
footprint there's a tower down here and

763
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,430
so a lot of places where farmers have a

764
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,099
lot of land

765
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:58,020
they'll we sell their land to a to a

766
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:00,990
wind farm and they'll continue to farm

767
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:05,069
down here it doesn't really bother them

768
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:07,290
so here's a size comparison looking at

769
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:09,740
wind turbines since the early 80s off

770
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:14,819
you can read this but this one says 1981

771
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:18,569
and at that time a big wind Mill Mariah

772
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:19,010
tea would produce 55 kilowatts or 55,000

773
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:22,859
watts

774
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:25,799
then by the late 80s we are seeing them

775
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:27,059
up to two hundred thousand watts or two

776
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:30,599
hundred kilowatts and they're getting

777
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:32,700
taller by the year 2000 we're looking at

778
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,450
eight hundred and fifty thousand watts

779
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:39,839
or any 150 kilowatts about 2002 or at

780
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:42,270
three thousand thousand watts which

781
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,329
means three million watts or three

782
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,940
megawatts right and and so as they make

783
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:49,500
them bigger you know one of the

784
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,470
advantages of having a very tall

785
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,180
windmill is that the wind is faster up

786
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,210
above our heads and it is at the surface

787
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,040
so they they're in stronger wind and you

788
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:02,309
have longer blades they catch more of

789
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,980
the wind and they can spin slower and

790
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:07,200
still produce a lot of power here's

791
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,799
another image of the size comparison a

792
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,559
10 kilowatt windmill versus up to a

793
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:17,250
three megawatt windmill the difference

794
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,809
in the sizes and they are still planning

795
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:22,109
on just making them bigger and bigger so

796
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:25,020
by 2020 this publication is predicting

797
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:30,180
we'll have a 10 megawatt 10 milli

798
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:35,610
what wind turbine by then so the

799
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:39,870
Telegraph in in England they did a

800
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:42,750
little documentary docu documenting how

801
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,800
noisy windmills were so what they're

802
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,260
doing is they're going up to the

803
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,200
quietest place they could find and they

804
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,110
have a loudness meter a decibel meter

805
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,890
and they're recording how many decibels

806
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:57,830
of sound is in this location and then

807
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,620
they go to a quiet neighborhood and

808
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:07,650
again they take measurements in decibels

809
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:09,270
there okay notice how slow these are

810
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,120
spinning okay that's about how fast

811
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:17,870
these windmills spin so half mile way

812
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:20,820
they still can't hear it 200 yards away

813
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:24,870
they notice that they're still quieter

814
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:26,370
than the planes flying overhead and they

815
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:30,510
don't really hear it till they get right

816
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:36,510
up next to it a few feet away you might

817
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:39,570
be able to hear it and they notice that

818
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:43,860
you know an average road is way noisier

819
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:44,310
than the then the wind turbines so point

820
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,430
being

821
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,900
they're quiet now and noise really is no

822
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,630
longer an issue like it used to be

823
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:55,220
however there's still people that hate

824
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:57,930
windmills president Trump famously hates

825
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:00,660
hates them because according to him

826
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:02,400
they're ugly he has complained that and

827
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,010
some of his golf courses that you can

828
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,550
see these windmills in the distance and

829
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:11,520
he doesn't like that so one of the

830
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:14,400
things that companies are doing is

831
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,800
putting windmills offshore so just a

832
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,780
little bit out in the ocean and out

833
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,120
there nobody can see them nobody can

834
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,280
hear them and also the winds are much

835
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:27,150
stronger and more consistent off the

836
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,360
coast so out there they can put in some

837
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:32,190
really big wind turbines you know these

838
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,780
are the biggest ones that that we're

839
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,910
currently making all these in these

840
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,050
pictures are at least 3 million watts

841
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,170
apiece

842
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,000
we watch a little video that's

843
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,650
promotional video from a company that

844
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,970
actually puts these things together and

845
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:50,080
they're basically bragging about

846
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:59,890
themselves but he has a video of their

847
00:39:50,080 --> 00:40:02,410
offshore windfarm in 2015 mhm i Vestas

848
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:04,900
offshore wind celebrated a track record

849
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:07,210
of 20 years of experience in the

850
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,000
offshore wind industry through our

851
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:12,610
history we have installed more than 700

852
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,880
offshore turbines equaling more than 2

853
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:18,490
gigawatts of capacity spread over 17

854
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,150
wind power plants in six European

855
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,040
markets

856
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:24,640
that's enough wind power to provide

857
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,100
energy for around 1.9 million households

858
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,230
for every turbine installed and

859
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,560
commissioned it has added to the unique

860
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:34,060
bank of knowledge we now possess

861
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,910
perfected over time and our drive for

862
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:41,320
innovation has led us to become one of

863
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:45,580
the industry leaders with the V 112 3.45

864
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:48,460
megawatt supplying energy to over 3,100

865
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:52,600
households in 2016

866
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:56,250
MHI Vestas will install the first V 160

867
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:59,860
for 8 megawatt turbines offshore the V

868
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,650
164 is the most powerful wind turbine in

869
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:06,910
the world with a total energy output to

870
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:09,760
supply more than 7,500 households the

871
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:13,120
blades reach 80 metres long equivalent

872
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:16,300
to nine London double-decker buses for

873
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:23,320
Airbus a380s could fit within the swept

874
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:26,080
area of over 21,000 square meters so not

875
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,230
all wind turbines are gigantic like

876
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,940
those that you just saw I homeowner can

877
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,820
buy a small one especially if you are on

878
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:37,030
solar you can buy them that will help

879
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:39,190
complement your solar installation these

880
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:41,620
would be a few hundred watts of peace

881
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:44,350
they do not move slow they move very

882
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,550
fast and they're usually pretty noisy as

883
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:51,320
well so the United States is a pretty

884
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,710
good place for wind turbines actually

885
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,500
and the windiest part of the country is

886
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,150
kind of right here in the middle now

887
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,240
over the tops of most mountains is a

888
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,040
good place for for installing a wind

889
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,510
turbine so all these places that you see

890
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,820
are kind of this beige color in here our

891
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,800
places where people have installed wind

892
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,540
turbines as wind goes up over a mountain

893
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,700
but right in the middle of the country

894
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,870
there's a root band a really strong wind

895
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,420
that's very reliable and so if you've

896
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:26,930
ever been safe you need a you know

897
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,220
panhandle of Texas there's that I mean

898
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,960
there's windmills being installed all

899
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,630
over the place it's kind of amazing to

900
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,310
see right now but right kind of in the

901
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,920
middle of the country is is the best

902
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:38,660
place to install windmill so we have a

903
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,190
lot of wind in this country that we

904
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:45,800
could harness so pros and cons of wind a

905
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:47,840
windmill it takes resources to build it

906
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,170
but once it's built as long as it's

907
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,580
running no greenhouse gasses at all you

908
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:56,960
can get millions of watts

909
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:59,090
out of a single windmill cons they are

910
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,350
traditionally have been pretty expensive

911
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:05,000
but that's been coming down and cost

912
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,830
still a public backlash against it some

913
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,740
people just don't like the the looks of

914
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:11,930
them or whatever also if you have when

915
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,330
installing windmills on top of the ridge

916
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,100
somewhere you know you got to run power

917
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,460
cables up there and that can be quite

918
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,310
expensive to just to install these

919
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,690
things and of course you can't have

920
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:27,500
windmills everywhere because it's just

921
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:29,540
not windy everywhere so another source

922
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,900
of renewable energy is that of

923
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,610
geothermal energy idea being if you

924
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,620
drill down on the earth it's going to

925
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,380
get hot and if you live in the right

926
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,540
spot it might get hot enough right under

927
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,210
where you live that you can use that for

928
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,920
hot water and if it's hot enough it

929
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:49,250
might actually generate steam and you

930
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,750
could turn a steam turbine so what are

931
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,330
the conditions where you might get that

932
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:55,760
well one is if you live somewhere where

933
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:57,670
there's recent volcanic activity if

934
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,350
you've had recent volcanic activity

935
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,540
there's probably a blob of magma that's

936
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,260
still down in the crust somewhere might

937
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,990
be a few miles down

938
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:10,230
but cold groundwater comes close to that

939
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:12,810
magma body heats up and Rises back to

940
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,220
the surface as hot water if it makes it

941
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,160
all the way to the surface you might get

942
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:18,510
a hot spring something like this and if

943
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,100
the conditions are right you might get

944
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,250
like a geyser something like Old

945
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,440
Faithful something like that but this is

946
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,790
a essentially a free source of hot water

947
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,490
if you could figure out how to tap it so

948
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:34,350
in some places like Iceland there is so

949
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,510
much volcanic activity and there's so

950
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:39,630
much magma in the crust that they have

951
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:42,180
an endless supply of hot water and so in

952
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:45,540
Iceland they actually have enough hot

953
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,790
water hot above the boiling point that

954
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,940
they can tap into that and just take

955
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,890
that steam and turn a steam turbine so

956
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,200
this is what a power plant in Iceland

957
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:57,510
looks like so there's no coal there's no

958
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,400
natural gas it's a it's a pretty simple

959
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:00,870
looking thing they just take hot water

960
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,270
out of the ground run that through a

961
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,740
turbine generate electricity it's a

962
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,600
pretty neat deal here's another one

963
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,030
right so again all these pipes is

964
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:12,140
they're bringing in the steam from

965
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:14,700
underground and turning turbines

966
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,290
Indonesia is another place so Indonesia

967
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,660
is a bunch of islands and they're all

968
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,790
volcanoes and so there's a decent amount

969
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:24,810
of magma still under the ground they're

970
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:26,700
generating hot water and so they have

971
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:30,450
you know here's a big geothermal power

972
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:33,630
plant same ideas Iceland taking steam

973
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:35,040
and generating electricity now there's

974
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,380
another way that you can make hot water

975
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,350
underground and that is if you had

976
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,600
friction from faulting so here's a

977
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:45,540
picture showing you know sometimes the

978
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,850
Earth's crust breaks into pieces and

979
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,230
those pieces slide past each other and

980
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:51,390
that's what they're trying to show here

981
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,070
here's a chunk of the crust

982
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,350
here's another chunk of the crust and

983
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,910
there's this I've got Fault right

984
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:00,570
between them and they're sliding past

985
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:02,730
each other very slowly and so on the

986
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,410
surface what we notice is that maybe

987
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,730
every hundred years or so there's a

988
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,570
little jerk and there's an earthquake

989
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:11,280
but turns out way down deep it's moving

990
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,900
a little bit every day maybe a few

991
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,990
millimetres a little bit and that's

992
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,060
generating friction it's making heat and

993
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,430
cold water

994
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,130
in contact with that gets hot in the

995
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:25,200
fault zone rises to the surface and you

996
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,110
can get a hot spring up here near the

997
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,980
surface just because of this fault

998
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:33,900
movement so anywhere you have faults you

999
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,210
have the possibility of making hot water

1000
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,820
in one of the most famous places in the

1001
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:41,550
United States for this is Nevada so here

1002
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,800
we're looking at a was this is called

1003
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,350
the Basin and Range province all through

1004
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,980
Nevada looks like this this chunk is

1005
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:52,440
moving up this chunk is moving down

1006
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:55,290
right between here there is a fault okay

1007
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:59,910
and if you were to drill down in this

1008
00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:03,030
zone you might strike hot water so

1009
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,310
here's kind of a cartoon diagram of what

1010
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,650
I mean by this so this block is moving

1011
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:10,140
down relatively this block is moving up

1012
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:12,810
and friction is occurring along this

1013
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:15,900
plane and if cold water is coming along

1014
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:18,480
here then it might heat up and come up

1015
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,910
you'll have hot springs up in here okay

1016
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,820
that's the idea

1017
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:25,890
so Nevada is in a geologic province

1018
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,020
that's being stretched apart so the

1019
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:30,780
crust is being is what are we being

1020
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,180
pulled apart in breaking into chunks so

1021
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,220
you can see from this view here that

1022
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,900
it's a bunch of linear looking mountains

1023
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,480
and valleys in between it's called the

1024
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,880
Basin and Range well there's a fault at

1025
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,210
the base on every one of those mountains

1026
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,790
and here's a map of faults and the

1027
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:50,310
colors tell you how fast the faults are

1028
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:52,590
moving in millimeters per year point

1029
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:54,990
being there's a lot of faults in in

1030
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:58,980
Nevada that are they have the potential

1031
00:47:54,990 --> 00:48:00,540
of generating hot water so for example

1032
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,480
here's what one looks like so there's a

1033
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,850
fault nearby and there's this hot water

1034
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:09,270
coming up making this hot spring out in

1035
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:12,350
the middle of Nevada so they decided to

1036
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:15,900
try to make a geothermal power plant

1037
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:19,050
utilizing this hot water and so they

1038
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:22,470
built this in the 80s and they started

1039
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:26,160
to extract hot water out of the ground

1040
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:29,520
and before they started that power plant

1041
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,800
there was a geyser field out there in

1042
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,160
the

1043
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:35,290
Thatta bale Huawei geyser field so kind

1044
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,450
of like Old Faithful just not as famous

1045
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,040
and it would shoot off hot water and

1046
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,110
there's hot springs around kind of like

1047
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,910
I showed you in that last picture well

1048
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,770
after they started the geothermal power

1049
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,870
plant and they started extracting hot

1050
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,760
water out of the ground one of the first

1051
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:51,220
things that happened is that geysers

1052
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,430
stopped and then the hot springs dried

1053
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,960
up so here's a place that used to have

1054
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:58,450
hot springs and there's nothing there

1055
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,190
anymore and one of the problems you can

1056
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:02,860
see in the background if you've never

1057
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:05,590
been to Nevada it's super dry it's in

1058
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:09,940
that rain rain shadow effect from the

1059
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:12,690
west coast and it was just not that much

1060
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,400
precipitation and so there's not much

1061
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:17,080
replenishment of the groundwater so when

1062
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,530
they started to extract the groundwater

1063
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:23,200
out they just started to simply run out

1064
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:25,150
of water so one of the things that they

1065
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,160
did they realized early on is they have

1066
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,740
to pump that water back into the ground

1067
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,570
so the idea is they pump the hot water

1068
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,600
out they run it through the steam

1069
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,430
turbine generates electricity then they

1070
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,500
take it after it's gone through the

1071
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,350
turbine and they pump as much of it as

1072
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:45,880
they can back into the ground so here's

1073
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:49,870
a graph of that so this is time this is

1074
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,790
where they started this y-axis is kind

1075
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,800
of confusing this is just imagine how

1076
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,110
much water is coming out of the ground

1077
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,000
that's the red and how much water

1078
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:00,610
they're putting back into them into the

1079
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,560
ground that's the black so they start

1080
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,000
out there getting a lot of hot water out

1081
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,060
of the ground they're generating a lot

1082
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,800
of electricity but as time goes on they

1083
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,100
get less and less hot water out of the

1084
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,080
ground and therefore they're collect

1085
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:17,080
Rissa T their power output goes down and

1086
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,880
down as well as well so they're still

1087
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,980
generating a little electricity with it

1088
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,000
but it's not nearly as much as they

1089
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:27,130
thought they were going to get

1090
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,520
unfortunately it's just too dry this is

1091
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:32,680
the curse of geothermal resources in the

1092
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,650
United States if you look at where most

1093
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,360
of the geothermal resources should be in

1094
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:39,520
other words if we were to drill in the

1095
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:42,550
crust where would we expect to find hot

1096
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,360
water you see it all over the West right

1097
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,110
and the

1098
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,450
Nevada right this whole region out here

1099
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,790
that's kind of reddish and even a little

1100
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:54,400
bit here are places where we would

1101
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:58,240
expect to find heat sources under the

1102
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,240
crust but it also corresponds to places

1103
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,770
that are the driest in the country so we

1104
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,030
talked about how this is at the driest

1105
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:08,140
part in the country right through here

1106
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:11,080
over here where it rains a lot not

1107
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,820
really any geothermal resources so our

1108
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,790
country has this problem that we've got

1109
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,440
places that's generating heat but just

1110
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:21,070
not enough groundwater to really take

1111
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,100
advantage of it so New Mexico is one of

1112
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:26,710
these places we have a lot of volcanoes

1113
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,900
in New Mexico so in this map all the red

1114
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,940
says volcanic rocks younger than 5

1115
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,950
million years old in geologic time

1116
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:36,550
that's considered a pretty young Rock 5

1117
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:38,350
million years so if we have these so all

1118
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,910
this red is relatively young volcanic

1119
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:44,290
rocks that means there's probably still

1120
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:47,110
magma under the crust and we also have a

1121
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:49,780
lot of earthquakes in New Mexico this

1122
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:51,490
cluster right here near Socorro is due

1123
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,350
to what we call the Socorro magma body

1124
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:56,800
there's a blob of magma down there

1125
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:59,560
moving around and some of these clusters

1126
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,710
that you see are actually due to fault

1127
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:05,140
movement we have a lot of faults in New

1128
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:08,020
Mexico and this is the map of them the

1129
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:11,440
colors designate the different ages of

1130
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:13,330
them but point is is we've got faults

1131
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,300
that are moving that should generate

1132
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:18,250
heat we've got magma that's also

1133
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:22,360
generating heat we ought to have

1134
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:24,100
geothermal resources but like the like

1135
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:28,300
in Nevada we just don't have much

1136
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:30,640
groundwater and so because of our lack

1137
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,980
of groundwater and also we haven't

1138
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:38,440
really found really hot water in New

1139
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:40,240
Mexico yet here's a map of the state so

1140
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,520
the blue says temperatures below 100

1141
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,930
degrees centigrade so that's not hot

1142
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,450
enough to boil so you're not going to

1143
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:48,910
get steam out of it that's the blue and

1144
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:50,830
then the red says temperatures above a

1145
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:52,930
hundred so in theory that would be

1146
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:54,820
enough to generate steam they've never

1147
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,890
really got it a well that can produce

1148
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:00,579
enough hot water to run out

1149
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:02,859
a thermal power plant though but we have

1150
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:08,559
used some of this warm water for other

1151
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:11,410
reasons so we have greenhouses in New

1152
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,549
Mexico that use geothermal hot water so

1153
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,910
it's pumped out of the ground it's

1154
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:19,150
already hot it heats buildings New

1155
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:20,380
Mexico State campus heats some of their

1156
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,410
buildings with warm water

1157
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:26,259
there are tapia fish farms that use some

1158
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:30,759
geothermal hot water as well too just as

1159
00:53:26,259 --> 00:53:32,380
a source of you know warm water so we're

1160
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:35,170
not generating electricity with it in

1161
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:37,989
this in the state but we are using some

1162
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:41,109
geothermal resources best that we can

1163
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:42,880
our final renewable resource that we're

1164
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:45,369
going to learn about in this class is

1165
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,029
that of hydroelectricity which is the

1166
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:51,819
idea of forming a dam so damming up a

1167
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:54,759
river making a reservoir behind the dam

1168
00:53:51,819 --> 00:53:57,099
and then forcing that water through the

1169
00:53:54,759 --> 00:54:00,190
bottom of the dam so that it turns a

1170
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:02,920
turbine which turns a generator which

1171
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,539
makes electricity so we kind of talked

1172
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,519
about this before when we did our

1173
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:08,589
project with rivers and dams and

1174
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:11,920
reservoirs and all that and in the

1175
00:54:08,589 --> 00:54:14,440
southwest all of those big dams that we

1176
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,220
talked about have hydroelectric power

1177
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,769
plants at the bottom of them so we

1178
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:23,619
looked at Hoover Dam so remember this is

1179
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:26,559
Lake Mead we're near Las Vegas and the

1180
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:29,950
water comes out down here and turns

1181
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,349
turbines to generate electricity so the

1182
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:35,019
water goes in at the bottom of these

1183
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:36,970
towers there's an inlet and the water

1184
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:38,859
goes to this big pipe that goes through

1185
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:40,329
the dam so this is I don't know like 100

1186
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:43,930
feet below the surface something like

1187
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:47,230
that headed towards these big turbines

1188
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:48,819
and the turbines themselves are they

1189
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:51,220
don't look like the steam turbines in

1190
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:52,989
this in this case they look like giant

1191
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,299
boat propellers or something like that

1192
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:58,319
but the water goes through and turns

1193
00:54:55,299 --> 00:55:01,029
this shaft which turns this big

1194
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:05,799
generator which in itself has magnetic

1195
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:07,989
fields in it that rotates and the this

1196
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:10,060
is what one of the generators looks like

1197
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:13,000
taken out of its housing so

1198
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,100
these things are the magnets and this is

1199
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,600
spinning around about sixty times a

1200
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:22,150
second so inside of hoover dam looks

1201
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:26,470
like this each one of these red round

1202
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:29,710
things has a generator in it so spinning

1203
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:32,170
inside of here are one of those rotors

1204
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:34,980
that you saw in the previous diagram so

1205
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:39,120
all said together it's making about

1206
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:43,630
2,000 megawatts so 2,000 million watts

1207
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:48,340
now to compare that with say some of our

1208
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:50,410
coal-fired power plants in the u.s. so

1209
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,140
we have coal-fired power plants of all

1210
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:56,260
different sizes and of the biggest like

1211
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:59,340
1500 to 2000 megawatts we've got 38 of

1212
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:03,700
them and over 2000 megawatts we've got

1213
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:07,930
29 of them so this number 2,080

1214
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:12,190
megawatts is as big as one of our

1215
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:14,610
biggest coal fire power plants here's

1216
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:17,980
another example Grand Coulee Dam in

1217
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:20,400
Washington State this is the Columbia

1218
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:23,740
River that's being dammed up this is at

1219
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,380
6,800 megawatts and again to compare it

1220
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:29,050
it would is it would produce as much

1221
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:31,660
electricity is about three of our

1222
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:35,890
equivalent biggest coal fire power

1223
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:37,840
plants another picture of Grand Coulee

1224
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:41,080
Dam while they're going over the

1225
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:43,720
spillway they're the world's largest

1226
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:46,780
hydroelectric dams in China it's called

1227
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,430
the Three Gorges Dam it took them a very

1228
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,960
long time to build it it was very

1229
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:53,560
controversial because they flooded

1230
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:56,650
cities in the process to do this has 32

1231
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:59,680
turbines makes twenty two thousand five

1232
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:02,380
hundred million Watts megawatts about

1233
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,600
ten of our largest coal fire power

1234
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,330
plants and it's quite a feat of

1235
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:11,170
engineering tremendous amount of water

1236
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:13,480
goes through Three Gorges Dam you can

1237
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:18,460
see it spans this really broad distance

1238
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:21,550
here across well hydroelectric power is

1239
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,170
great as long as you have water but a

1240
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,650
lot of these dams that we're talking

1241
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,630
about

1242
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:29,590
once we have in the United States are on

1243
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:33,280
the west coast and Southwest like like

1244
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:36,010
Meade and Hoover Dam here and the

1245
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:40,090
problem is we have been undergoing a lot

1246
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,860
of drought and we have a lot of water

1247
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:44,350
allocations like we talked about in the

1248
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:46,090
past so one of the problems were having

1249
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:47,860
is there is not enough water left in the

1250
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:50,050
reservoirs to actually run the

1251
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:53,200
generators to run those turbines

1252
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:55,150
so here's Lake Mead here's a recent

1253
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,670
photo and the water is so low that it's

1254
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:01,180
actually not even going into the pipes

1255
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:04,000
that lead to the generators you can see

1256
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,380
so here we're on Lake Mead here that's

1257
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,420
where the top of the lake

1258
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:10,660
ought to be right yeah it's like a

1259
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:12,760
bathtub ring you can see here very low

1260
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,710
compared to word where it should be or

1261
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,420
here's another example you can see where

1262
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:19,030
the shoreline is supposed to be out in

1263
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:22,870
here right and then the water is way

1264
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:24,820
down here another example this is was

1265
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:27,940
all underwater except for this little

1266
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:30,070
island sticking up and you can see all

1267
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,610
the land that's now sticking out of the

1268
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:37,300
water because of the drought situation

1269
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:38,950
this is a boat ramp boat boat ramp slash

1270
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:42,520
boat launch area marina

1271
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:43,720
and here's where it used to be right

1272
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,180
this is where you used to launch your

1273
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:48,780
boat off of this and you see it they've

1274
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:51,640
had to move it all the way down there so

1275
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,530
this is a problem in many of our

1276
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,120
reservoirs that have hydroelectric dams

1277
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:58,240
right now there's just not enough water

1278
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:02,020
to run the generators here's one from

1279
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:04,390
California this is what the dam looked

1280
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:08,320
like maybe I don't know 10 20 years ago

1281
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:10,750
and this is a more recent photo and you

1282
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,580
can see those pipes right there those

1283
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:15,160
are the turn stalks that's what takes

1284
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,110
the water from the lake and takes it

1285
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,150
down to the generators but they're high

1286
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,880
and dry they're not getting any water to

1287
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:25,900
generate electricity with so pros and

1288
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:27,550
cons making water with hydroelectric

1289
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,440
dams is great in terms of greenhouse

1290
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:30,550
gases because they just don't generate

1291
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,940
any they're just spinning around

1292
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:36,280
generating electricity 24 hours a day

1293
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:38,140
burning no fossil fuels no air pollution

1294
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,050
is being produced

1295
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:44,800
the cons back when we had our lecture

1296
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:47,440
about the problem with dams and how that

1297
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,990
changes the water temperature and the

1298
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,450
water pH and and all that stuff that

1299
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:54,430
still applies right blocks fish

1300
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:56,260
migrations all those things all that

1301
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:59,140
still apply so what we talked about

1302
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:01,930
before applies here as well

1303
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:03,700
you can't dam up a lot of rivers in most

1304
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:05,590
of the country in fact you need the

1305
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,960
right kind of topography and we really

1306
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:09,430
only have that along kind of the west

1307
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:12,550
part of the United States where we have

1308
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:14,440
a mountainous terrain and then as I just

1309
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:17,140
Illustrated these things are subject to

1310
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,000
drought so as long as you have water and

1311
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,980
you can run water through your turbines

1312
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,600
then that's great but if we're in the

1313
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:26,290
drought situation like we've been in the

1314
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,510
last 20 ish years it's getting harder

1315
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:31,890
and harder to actually generate

1316
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:31,890
electricity with this method

1317
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:40,349
you
