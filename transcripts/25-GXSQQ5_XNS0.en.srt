00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,670
hey guys this is Mel and this is our

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,460
last lecture in which I'm going to

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,949
review some of the things out of your

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,250
book that are going to be on the last

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,350
exam so we're gonna kind of skip around

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,609
on a few topics that I think might have

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,949
been a little bit confusing

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,519
all of this pertains a climate change

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,380
one way or the other so one of the

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,160
topics that they talked about in your

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,520
book was this idea of a climate model so

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,280
a climate model is really a computer

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,829
program a very complicated one in the

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,059
way that we think about it is imagine if

15
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,730
we took all of the ocean and broke it up

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,500
into little cubes and then we took the

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,230
surface of the land and broke it up into

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,360
little squares and then we took all of

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,070
the atmosphere and you broke those up

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,369
into cubes now we know all of the

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,409
physics that goes on inside each one of

22
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,040
these cubes in the atmosphere and inside

23
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,020
each one of the cubes in the ocean and

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,970
what the process is going on inside each

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,580
square over the land

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,210
so for each cube in the atmosphere for

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,189
example we know all the physics all the

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,990
thermodynamics all the fluid dynamics

29
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:31,170
etc that happens in each box and so what

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,939
we do is we make a computer program that

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:38,310
does the math that occurs within each

32
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:40,829
cube in the atmosphere and also each

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,500
cube in the ocean and then calculates

34
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,500
what's happening between the squares on

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,390
the continents and the cubes in the

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,270
atmosphere so it's doing exchange

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,159
calculation so here's an example I would

38
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,630
not expect you to know what any of this

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,390
math means that each cube of the

40
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,240
atmosphere we can solve all these

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,140
different things for each each single

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,970
cube now if we did this by hand if we

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,830
had enough time we could calculate all

44
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,410
the conditions and all the physics that

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,830
are going on inside one cube but we're

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,050
trying to

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,120
do this for the whole atmosphere so what

48
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,790
we do is we break the atmosphere up into

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,620
a bazillion little cubes and then we

50
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,410
have a really really fast computer

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,560
generally one that has many processors

52
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,990
and we assign one processor to each cube

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,540
so in other words it's like each cube

54
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:38,760
gets its own little computer that's part

55
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:41,730
of this big supercomputer so let's skip

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,730
that one here the biggest computers the

57
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,730
fastest computers in the world look

58
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,550
something like this and this this one

59
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,100
for a while was the fastest computer in

60
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,750
the world it's has not been that for for

61
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:59,250
some time now it was called the earth

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:02,580
simulator and all it did was run what we

63
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,620
call climate model so you program in all

64
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,570
of those equations for all those boxes

65
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,650
in the atmosphere and the ocean in the

66
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:12,270
land and then you essentially you know a

67
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,060
computer like this might have a couple

68
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,850
hundred thousand processors and you sign

69
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,060
a processor to each box and they're all

70
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,700
solving these equations simultaneously

71
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,270
so it takes a lot of computer power to

72
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,100
do this and so early computer models

73
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,260
back then they actually started this in

74
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,620
the 70s when computers were pretty slow

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,989
and then as the computers got faster our

76
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,430
climate models got better so one of the

77
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,660
things that has made our climate models

78
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,280
better is the size of the boxes has

79
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,820
gotten smaller so if you're trying to

80
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,070
simulate the atmosphere if you had were

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,170
giant boxes like if you subdivide the

82
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,850
the Earth's atmosphere into like 12

83
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,060
giant boxes that's not a very good

84
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,220
simulation they're smaller and smaller

85
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,560
you make the boxes the more realistic it

86
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,020
becomes but the more calculations are

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,630
required and the faster computer you

88
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,950
need to do this and so as our computers

89
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,170
have gotten faster our climate models

90
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:16,260
have gotten better so here's an example

91
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:19,470
of 1990s climate model so each Q was 270

92
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,350
by 270 kilometers well that's a pretty

93
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,640
big box and that's a that's the best

94
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,070
they could do of the computers at the

95
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,660
time but there could be a lot of things

96
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,580
going on inside that box

97
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,200
in the atmosphere that you would not be

98
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,110
able to simulate because your box is

99
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,340
simply too big so it when this slide was

100
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:41,070
made it says present day 135 by 135

101
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,950
today we have climate models that can do

102
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:47,040
30 kilometer by 30 kilometer boxes and

103
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:49,620
so today with today's fastest

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,800
supercomputers we can simulate the

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,600
atmosphere pretty well like we we are

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,210
box the boxes are small enough and the

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,120
math is tight enough that we do pretty

108
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,690
good simulations so once you have a

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,300
really good climate model that works you

110
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,430
can do different experiments with it and

111
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,130
this is there you have a diagram like

112
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,710
this in your book so let me try to

113
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,230
explain what this is a one of the IPCC

114
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:20,580
diagrams so let me try to explain what

115
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:24,180
they're doing here so imagine if you

116
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:28,140
went back to say the early 1900's and

117
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,810
you said ok we're going to change

118
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,850
history and humans are not going to add

119
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,730
any more greenhouse gases to the

120
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,050
atmosphere ok so what you would do in

121
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,180
your climate model is you would go

122
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,220
essentially back in time and say what

123
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,060
was the Earth's atmosphere look like

124
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,880
today modern time if we went back to the

125
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,440
early 1900's and we decided not to emit

126
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,830
greenhouse gases like what would have

127
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,930
happened and so the climate model cranks

128
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,840
away at the math and all those cubes and

129
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,750
it spits out an answer and then you can

130
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,290
go back and say ok what would the

131
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,720
climate be like today if we did put in

132
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,190
greenhouse gases and the computer cranks

133
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,230
it out and cranks out and spits out an

134
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,820
answer and we can compare those two

135
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:15,900
answers so this is kind of what they've

136
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,810
done here so let's look at this one here

137
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,840
that says global ok so there's a blue

138
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,150
envelope and the blue is kind of behind

139
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,280
the pink here from here to here and then

140
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,040
there's this pink and then there's this

141
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,140
black coin all right so they went back

142
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,750
to the early 1900's they asked the

143
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,390
supercomputer let's take out greenhouse

144
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,910
gasses that humans have added called

145
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,520
anthropogenic forcings that's what

146
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,650
they're calling it here

147
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,780
and let's just run this climate model

148
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,460
and see what it does and it spits out

149
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,889
now this is on the y-axis this is

150
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,810
temperature anomaly and here it says

151
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,430
zero so zero Degree temperature not only

152
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,580
means normal right

153
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,530
so what it says is that cranks out to

154
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,690
the year 2000 when this this one was

155
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,879
made and it says that worldwide

156
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,030
temperatures should have followed sort

157
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,949
of this blue envelope right here now the

158
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,259
reason is not a single line is that

159
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,330
there's multiple computer models that

160
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:13,280
are run by multiple research groups on

161
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,990
multiple computers and they all give a

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
slightly different answer but the

163
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,460
answers converge in this blue envelope

164
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,409
here okay or you could break it out by

165
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:26,000
continent like they did here in South

166
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:27,380
America or Africa or whatever okay so

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,440
then they run it again they say alright

168
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,449
can supercomputer let's throw in some

169
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,370
greenhouse gases and run it again and

170
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,789
see what you get so they do that again

171
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,110
and that's what this pink envelope is

172
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:41,150
here now you can see that the

173
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,729
temperatures would go up as we get close

174
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,569
to the year 2000 or if we look at South

175
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,759
America or if you look at Africa etc so

176
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:53,330
then so the so the supercomputer is

177
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,669
saying no green no anthropogenic

178
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,740
greenhouse gases the human the ones that

179
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,389
humans make no extra greenhouse gases

180
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,460
temperatures should have done what the

181
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,319
blue is showing with the greenhouse

182
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,990
gases temperatures would do what the

183
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,180
pink is showing the black is the

184
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,860
temperatures we actually measured so

185
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,080
these are real life temperatures that

186
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,120
people measured with thermometers over

187
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,099
time so what this is saying is that

188
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,389
temperatures that we actually measured

189
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:23,029
the black line correspond to the climate

190
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:25,789
model outputs that predicted this map

191
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:28,130
amount of warming with those extra

192
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:30,560
greenhouse gases so the other way to

193
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,209
think about is that if humans did not do

194
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,520
what we did if we didn't burn fossil

195
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:36,500
fuels we didn't add greenhouse gases to

196
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,709
the atmosphere the temperatures on earth

197
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,450
should be following the blue but instead

198
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:43,789
we follow we see that they're following

199
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,399
the pink now in a previous lecture we

200
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,790
went through some of the reasons why we

201
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,930
eliminated why sunspots are not the

202
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,550
source of global warming

203
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,070
why volcanoes are not the source of

204
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,900
global warming what

205
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,970
is this as sort of another piece of

206
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,950
evidence that says the math actually

207
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,710
checks out that the extra greenhouse

208
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:06,070
gases do provide the amount of extra

209
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:09,730
warming that we notice now for some

210
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:12,100
reason in in the in climate change world

211
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,360
the scientists use this term forcings

212
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,670
and you may have read that a bunch in

213
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,070
your book I don't like that term but

214
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,200
it's very popular so forcing means

215
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,030
you're going to add something to the

216
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,250
atmosphere that's going to force the

217
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,530
temperature to change okay that's what

218
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,380
it means so if I add more co2 to the

219
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:32,170
atmosphere that is a forcing it's going

220
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,150
to force the the warming to occur if I

221
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,800
have more sunspots that's another type

222
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,960
of forcing it's going to force the

223
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,750
climate to change so down here it says

224
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,760
models only using natural forcings what

225
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,890
that means is naturally occurring things

226
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,710
sunspots volcanoes naturally-occurring

227
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,320
greenhouse gases models using both

228
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,480
natural and anthropogenic forcings means

229
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,820
take all the folk a nose and sunspots

230
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,590
and all that and then also add the

231
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,450
greenhouse gases that humans are putting

232
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,400
in that's what they mean that's what

233
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,150
forcings mean it's I don't again it's a

234
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,420
word that I think it's kind of confusing

235
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,340
so recap here the blue line computer

236
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,860
model outputs without anthropogenic

237
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,540
greenhouse gases red computer model

238
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,020
outputs with anthropogenic greenhouse

239
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,940
gases black is the observed temperature

240
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,710
so what we can say is it's very likely

241
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,740
that the warming we're seeing is doing

242
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,270
is due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases

243
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,400
another way that we think about this is

244
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,680
we've kind of eliminated all other

245
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,240
possibilities right I mean we talked in

246
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,750
this class about sunspots and we talked

247
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,510
about volcanoes the Earth's orbit does

248
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,820
change but not nearly as fast as well to

249
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,710
explain the warming that we have so the

250
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,840
cut only thing we're really left with

251
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,790
are the greenhouse gases that we as

252
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,950
humans have added to the atmosphere and

253
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,300
the computer math basically says yeah

254
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,300
that looks like the most likely

255
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,400
explanation so the other thing that we

256
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,060
can do with climate models is we can use

257
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,230
them to try to predict the future so

258
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,440
once you have a really good simulation

259
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:05,230
of the atmosphere then you can ask it

260
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,850
questions like well how is that how is

261
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,930
the climate going to be different say a

262
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,340
hundred years from now

263
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:15,390
so we've got the math down and we have

264
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,800
the programming in the COS software down

265
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,110
but there's still one big uncertainty

266
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,790
and the big uncertainty is we don't know

267
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,520
what the future of greenhouse gas

268
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,460
emissions is going to be so there's a

269
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:32,020
part of your book early kind of part to

270
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:33,880
it mostly where it talks about how there

271
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,420
are these different scenarios that the

272
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:41,950
IPCC has put together and they have

273
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,830
these goofy names like RCP 8.5 and RCP

274
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,880
6.0 and so what they did is they got

275
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,250
together and they said look we don't

276
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,190
know what the future is gonna be like

277
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,660
but let's say what would happen if we

278
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,910
continue on the current path we are

279
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,460
right now right or burning a certain

280
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,170
amount of fossil fuels each year a

281
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,050
little bit more each year a little bit

282
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:05,200
more and let's just imagine that keeps

283
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,660
on going into the future or what would

284
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,910
happen if the countries got together and

285
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,410
they had some kind of treaty and they

286
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,960
said we're gonna cut greenhouse gas

287
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,900
emissions down right and so they come up

288
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,470
with another possible scenario like well

289
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:23,080
maybe one one of these and so the best

290
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,180
they can do is they come up with these

291
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,370
different scenarios and they put them

292
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,070
into the climate models and they

293
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,750
calculate what the result would be if we

294
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,830
went down these different paths but we

295
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,270
don't know what path we're going to go

296
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:41,190
down so that's what these emissions

297
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:46,330
pathways are all about so in your book

298
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:50,670
so here I am on page 92 and so here's a

299
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:54,220
graph that says global co2 emissions in

300
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:57,780
Giga tons of carbon per year and this is

301
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,730
time so the black is our historical

302
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,220
that's what we have humans have already

303
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,680
done how much co2 we put into the

304
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,900
atmosphere how much carbon and then here

305
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,910
it breaks into yellow at the time that

306
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,400
this graph was made it was a year 2000

307
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,630
and they were doing projections into the

308
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,310
future so you know depending on what you

309
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,470
know if the if the economy continues to

310
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,340
boom and there's no regulations well we

311
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,500
might go up

312
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,480
red curve and then if countries get

313
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,950
together and decided hey we should you

314
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,140
know save the earth well maybe that's

315
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,380
going to be the blue curve and so forth

316
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,180
so these are the different scenarios and

317
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,140
how the different projections played out

318
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,050
into the future

319
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,380
okay so then they asked the

320
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,790
supercomputers - okay well if if we did

321
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,650
say the orange curve

322
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,660
what would the temperature of the earth

323
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:52,770
be like by the time we get to the year

324
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,770
2100 right okay so a couple pages later

325
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,470
here's an example of what one of these

326
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,460
looks like so now the y-axis saw on page

327
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:06,910
98 global surface temperature change

328
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:09,250
alright so up to here this is - mm like

329
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:15,190
2005 which is the time that they made

330
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:17,080
this particular graph and RCP 8.5 that's

331
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,050
that was the red curve on the previous

332
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:24,580
one now it's this red with the pink

333
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:27,700
envelope around it saying okay if the

334
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,860
world follows the red path of that RCP

335
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,140
8.5 in the in the in the previous

336
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,770
diagram how will the temperature change

337
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,330
well it will change like this that's

338
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,970
what the computers are telling us and

339
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,610
the further out we go you can think of

340
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,380
it this is like the the red line is sort

341
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,040
of the center and this this is the range

342
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,420
of uncertainty around and the more the

343
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,830
further out you go in the future the

344
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,450
more uncertainty you get in your

345
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:58,090
prediction but what they're saying is if

346
00:14:52,450 --> 00:15:00,670
we follow the red path the 8.5 path then

347
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:04,450
we will we will see temperatures

348
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,920
increase well in this pink zone which if

349
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,050
you look across here is somewhere

350
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:14,040
between 3 degrees and maybe 5 degrees

351
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:17,230
centigrade above where it should be

352
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,030
which in Fahrenheit is five and a half

353
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,710
degrees at night versus nine degrees and

354
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,070
nine degrees Fahrenheit above what it

355
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,510
should be

356
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:28,180
whereas if we picked the blue one right

357
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:31,380
this is the RCP 2.6 now what did what

358
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,380
was that that was the

359
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,350
okay that's kind of the best case

360
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,840
scenario this is the one where we all

361
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,420
get together as a world and we say we

362
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,600
gotta cut co2 emissions and we actually

363
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,280
make big measures probably like this

364
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,900
would be the best possible scenario like

365
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,630
if we all got together and we started

366
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:55,250
cutting our fossil fuel consumption a

367
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:56,780
lot well then that is this curve so it's

368
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,340
gonna it predicts that temperatures will

369
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,040
still going to increase a little bit

370
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,050
because we already have so much co2 in

371
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,450
the atmosphere already and they're going

372
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:09,710
to kind of stabilize along this purple

373
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:11,630
line so the computer models the climate

374
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,420
models are predicting that the climate

375
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,620
is going to change somewhere between you

376
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,290
can think of this is like best-case

377
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,790
scenario and maybe worst-case scenario

378
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,500
although it could be even a little bit

379
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,940
worse than this but realistically it's

380
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,210
probably going to be between these two

381
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,880
curves which means that by the year 2100

382
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,030
we're expecting temperatures to be about

383
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,470
one degree centigrade which is close to

384
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,200
two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than

385
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,210
normal up to maybe five degrees

386
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:43,190
centigrade or nine degrees Fahrenheit

387
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:45,440
warmer than normal so point being our

388
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:50,360
climate prediction models are only as

389
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,480
good as the as a prediction that we can

390
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,970
make to our greenhouse gas emissions so

391
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,550
what I've been doing in the in my

392
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,460
face-to-face classes is talk about some

393
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,200
of the history behind some of the

394
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,610
attempts that the world you know that

395
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,490
the world has seen that try to do

396
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:09,170
something about greenhouse gases so one

397
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,650
of the one of the things that comes out

398
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:15,290
of that modeling is that if we want

399
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,750
greenhouse gases to kind of be flat and

400
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,540
stop increasing we actually have to

401
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,209
start decreasing our greenhouse gas

402
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,350
emissions because there's so much

403
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,959
greenhouse gas emissions that are

404
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,400
already up into the atmosphere so one

405
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,330
day the big attempts was something

406
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,960
called the Kyoto Protocol and this was

407
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:37,220
adopted in 97 and then countries started

408
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,660
to follow it and you think of it like a

409
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,760
treaty when two countries getting

410
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,710
together signing a treaty to say we're

411
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,920
gonna start lowering our co2 emissions

412
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:48,980
and originally had

413
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,110
hundred ninety-two countries everybody

414
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,690
signing on thinking about how they're

415
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,660
gonna cut greenhouse gases but then in

416
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:01,610
2001 the u.s. drops out says well we're

417
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:05,120
not signing on to this and so we dropped

418
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:07,160
out of this particular treaty and then

419
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,860
more recently there was another attempt

420
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,350
called the climb espera de Paris climate

421
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,730
Accord and they were trying to limit the

422
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,710
future

423
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,120
temperature increases to about one and a

424
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,430
half degrees centigrade which again

425
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,080
means you gotta cut down those co2

426
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:27,530
emissions 195 countries signed on as of

427
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,000
2015 and as soon as Trump got in office

428
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,640
that was kind of one the first things he

429
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,040
did is he said we're out of the Paris

430
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,480
climate Accord and so now we've dropped

431
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,550
out so the problem with these treaties

432
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,890
is it's kind of a volunteer thing

433
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:43,010
countries get together they sign on but

434
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:47,030
no one's forcing you to stay so the u.s.

435
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:49,190
just left and in the problem with that

436
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,530
is historically the US has been the

437
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,290
number one contributor in greenhouse gas

438
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:58,820
emissions now today we're actually

439
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:02,750
number two China has taken the world as

440
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,070
the number one co2 emitter now if you

441
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,710
add up a whole bunch of other countries

442
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,430
together you get a big chunk too but the

443
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,650
three Biggie's are China US and the

444
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,750
European Union and enfold you know by a

445
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,670
bunch of other countries so you know

446
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:20,060
when we drop out we're like a major

447
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,620
major contributor to these to the

448
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,210
greenhouse gas emissions and then once

449
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,280
we drop out then the other countries are

450
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,350
saying well why are we gonna do this if

451
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,840
the u.s. is not going to do it if you

452
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,560
look at keywords have co2 emissions in

453
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,480
the past 150 years so this is not the

454
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,510
amount that we're emitting today this is

455
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,290
like all the co2 we've emitted since you

456
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:45,890
know late 1800s you see that the number

457
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,960
one by far is the United States and then

458
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,790
surprisingly number two is Germany and

459
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,580
the number three is China

460
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,650
okay so historically we've been the

461
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,840
biggest emitter and so when we drop out

462
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,220
of these treaties that kind of looks bad

463
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,220
for the United States

464
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,150
and then of course without going

465
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,950
political we have to talk about the

466
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,600
current political climate which is that

467
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,660
we currently have an administration that

468
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,600
thinks that global warming is not even

469
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,900
real so this is a famous tweet from

470
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,450
Donald Trump concept the global warming

471
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,980
was created by and for the Chinese in

472
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,220
order to make the US manufacturing

473
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:29,230
non-competitive so he's famously as has

474
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,270
said that he thinks everything I've been

475
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:35,530
telling you is is a hoax that the

476
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:38,680
Chinese government made up so with that

477
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:43,240
and with the fact that we have the head

478
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:46,750
of the EPA Scott Pruett also is a firm

479
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,160
non believer in climate changed that it

480
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,220
doesn't look like we're going to be

481
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,850
signing on any co2 treaties in the near

482
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,100
future

483
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,120
so the reason I'm bringing this up is

484
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,420
when we're trying to make these

485
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,090
predictions these types of curves right

486
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,000
now based on the current political

487
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,560
climate we're headed up this curve right

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,590
this is this is the one we're headed up

489
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,290
right now now let's say in a couple

490
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,050
years all the current administration is

491
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,580
thrown out of office and a new group

492
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,530
comes in and they say you know what

493
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,590
we're all about solar energy we're all

494
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,270
about wind power we're gonna we're going

495
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,460
to tax the fossil fuels whatever you

496
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,080
know whatever the scenario is maybe

497
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,320
that'll suddenly shift us and we'll be

498
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,820
on the blue path and maybe we'll be on

499
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,440
the blue path for four years and then

500
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,110
they get kicked out of office and then

501
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,090
another bunch of fossil fuel proponents

502
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,490
come in then we're shifting back to the

503
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,220
to the the black curve again so this is

504
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,740
why it's so hard to predict right over

505
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,290
the last few years we've been headed up

506
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,690
the black curve maybe it'll change maybe

507
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,360
it won't or what if there's a big

508
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,000
worldwide economic crash so we had one

509
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,440
in 2008 the amount of greenhouse gas has

510
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,150
started to go down because there was

511
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,590
less manufacturing because people were

512
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,190
buying less because we had less money

513
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,450
that could happen again right so so it's

514
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,820
really hard to predict the features so

515
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,320
this is why it's hard to predict the

516
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,490
climate change that's actually going to

517
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,679
occur in the next a hundred years or so

518
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:18,169
so let's look at a couple examples of

519
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,330
one of these climate model predictions

520
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:23,840
so the first one we're going to look at

521
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:27,020
is our CP 2.6 all right so from your

522
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,500
book this is the one where the country's

523
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,350
the whole world gets together realizes

524
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,909
the error of their ways and

525
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,370
significantly restricts greenhouse gas

526
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:41,900
emissions right I mean it's really not

527
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:44,900
realistic but let's just say that the

528
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,120
co2 emission curve looks like this it

529
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,510
goes down into the future and so the

530
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,130
year 2100 all right

531
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,289
what would the temperatures look like on

532
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:57,340
earth so this is the what we're gonna

533
00:22:54,289 --> 00:23:01,100
look at here is the output of a model

534
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:03,350
where were we are looking at the globe

535
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,659
of the earth and we're gonna know this

536
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,289
one was run you know almost 10 years ago

537
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:13,240
2009 and it did a prediction is that if

538
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:17,600
the world follows this RCP 2.6 emissions

539
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:20,390
curve what do we get and the colors tell

540
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,659
us the temperature change in in this

541
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:27,740
case it's in Fahrenheit in the future

542
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:31,220
okay so we'll play this and so as years

543
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,470
go by here you can see that most of the

544
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,480
warming is occurring in the northern

545
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,630
hemisphere and over the continents which

546
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,700
is what we've seen before and I'm gonna

547
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,700
stop it when we get to the year 2100 ooh

548
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:52,220
so if I go back a little bit there so

549
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:55,010
most of the warming is occurring up near

550
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,140
the Arctic right and if you think back a

551
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,450
few lectures when we looked at the maps

552
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,850
of current warming the warming that

553
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,549
we've seen in the last hundred years we

554
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,260
see the most warming up here and what

555
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:08,419
this model is saying is that in the

556
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,880
future that's going to continue now

557
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:13,700
remember this is like an unrealistic

558
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,559
best-case scenario that that all you

559
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,480
know all the countries get together big

560
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,750
kumbaya we're gonna save the world we're

561
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,320
gonna cut co2 emissions and yet still we

562
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,650
see temperature increases up here kind

563
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,450
of

564
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:31,130
around seven to ten degree Fahrenheit

565
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,830
mark so that means seven to ten degrees

566
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:38,030
Fahrenheit above what it's supposed to

567
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:41,080
be okay so now let's compare that to

568
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:44,690
another one of the curves

569
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:49,340
okay so let's compare that so we just

570
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:53,600
saw the result the model output of this

571
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:56,350
future RCP 2.6 well let's go to the

572
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,120
other extreme let's look at the 8.5

573
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,420
which in a previous slide was the black

574
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,220
curve and in your book it's red but this

575
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,530
is the scenario that basically we're

576
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,840
currently on right we're headed up this

577
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,300
red curve if nothing else changes

578
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,640
alright so we're gonna play another one

579
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,160
of those movies and it's just like the

580
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,480
previous one except now we have

581
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,480
different emission scenario

582
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:26,150
so first the pattern looks pretty

583
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,520
similar we're seeing more warming over

584
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,710
the continents than the oceans more

585
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,470
warming over the northern hemisphere

586
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,260
than the rest but notice how much redder

587
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,570
these colors are right how much darker

588
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:43,310
they are so I'm gonna try to pause this

589
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:46,760
one and notice the reddest part up here

590
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:49,880
in the Arctic that's 25 degrees

591
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,350
Fahrenheit above normal and this is the

592
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,080
thing that you've got to keep in mind

593
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:56,150
when we do climate predictions climate

594
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,370
model predictions in the future it's

595
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,410
always given as a global so in other

596
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,140
words people say well the earth is going

597
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:05,210
to warm by two degrees or three degrees

598
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,820
you think what's two or three degrees

599
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,950
who cares but that's a global average

600
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,530
and remember that a lot of the earth

601
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,890
like out in the ocean along the equator

602
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:18,620
is not changing that much but in this

603
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:22,040
scenario they again the eight point five

604
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,780
scenario you've got areas up here in the

605
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,770
Arctic that have increased by twenty

606
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:30,200
five degrees Fahrenheit above average so

607
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,480
that's huge and we also see big

608
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,670
increases over land masses in the

609
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,840
northern hemisphere too right so up here

610
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,090
in northern Siberia

611
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,860
you know increases of

612
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:44,600
degrees Farenheit so these are crazy

613
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,880
numbers so the patterns that the climate

614
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,740
models are showing are the same kinds of

615
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,110
patterns that we've been seeing in the

616
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,110
previous maps of climate change today

617
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:56,059
more climate warming in the in the

618
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,610
northern hemisphere and more over the

619
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:00,830
continents and the oceans it's just kind

620
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,390
of a matter of degree right so this

621
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,090
scenario here the eight-point-five

622
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,950
scenario again that's business what they

623
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:10,039
call business as usual it's sort of the

624
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,529
path that we're on is the one that has

625
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,440
the the most warming the first one I

626
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:17,690
showed you which was the 2.6 that's like

627
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,149
best-case scenario and they're still

628
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:24,580
predicted to be some warming in the

629
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:24,580
northern hemisphere and over the oceans

630
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:33,059
so a major misconception that people

631
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:35,070
have about global warming on both sides

632
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,169
those that actually believe that it's

633
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,399
happening and those that deny that it's

634
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:41,249
happening or don't believe that it's

635
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,429
happening is as follows

636
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:47,129
so we talked about in the past lecture

637
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,809
about the roz be waivers right so here

638
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:50,789
what I'm looking at is I'm looking at

639
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:53,210
temperatures at the 700 million bar

640
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:56,190
level which is about 10,000 feet above

641
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,559
sea level and we talked about how

642
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,190
there's a very distinct boundary between

643
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,279
the warmest air and the much colder air

644
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:08,879
and that boundary is wavy those are the

645
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,710
rows B waves and they move right okay so

646
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:14,730
let's say I assume this is just from

647
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:16,980
today and if you remember back till we

648
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,350
talked about mid latitude cyclones and

649
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,889
fronts what we were saying is that these

650
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:25,080
two different air masses mix up together

651
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:27,779
so right now you've got a blob a pretty

652
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,809
cold air moving down south here and

653
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:34,710
you've got warm air that's moving up to

654
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:36,990
the north and here and up in here okay

655
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,639
so let's think about what two people two

656
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,950
different people might be experiencing

657
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:45,389
right now if you live here you you are

658
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,909
experiencing below normal temperatures

659
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:51,450
today because this cold air from the

660
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:54,119
north is coming down if you have here

661
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,490
you are experiencing warmer temperatures

662
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:59,399
than normal because this warm air is

663
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,049
moving up to the north right so we got

664
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:05,190
cold fronts and warm fronts we talked

665
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:06,210
about this in past lectures if you

666
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,450
didn't know anything about the weather

667
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,879
and you lived right here you might be

668
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,529
thinking oh where we are above normal

669
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:15,179
temperatures and if you live it over

670
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:17,490
here you're below normal temperatures

671
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:20,879
and if you wanted to you might try to

672
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,980
attribute that to global warming or not

673
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:25,619
so in other words the person that's

674
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,009
right here might be saying oh this

675
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:32,190
global warming it's so warm today right

676
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:33,990
but the reason it's warm today has

677
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,240
nothing to do with global warming it's

678
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,399
because they are in this warm air mass

679
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,290
that's moving to the north and these

680
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,360
people here might be thinking ah

681
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,940
global warming is a hoax because think

682
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,740
look how cold it is today but it has

683
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,140
nothing to do with global warming or not

684
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,870
it's just that they are in this pool of

685
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,930
cold air sinking down from the from the

686
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:58,940
north this is what happens over and over

687
00:29:54,930 --> 00:30:01,110
in the discussion about global warming

688
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,790
every day around the world there are

689
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,710
places that are below average

690
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,310
temperature and there are places that

691
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,780
are above average temperature it's all

692
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,970
happens all the time and if we look

693
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,860
around the you know if I look just

694
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,660
what's happening today here's a place

695
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,450
where this cold air coming down

696
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,760
warm air going up so again if you lived

697
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,860
over here you are below average

698
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,510
temperatures if you lived here you're

699
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,150
above average right if I go over here

700
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:29,310
here's another one this is a blob of

701
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,190
cold air they're below average this

702
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,960
right here is above average over here

703
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,680
these guys are above average

704
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,600
these guys are below average so normally

705
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,010
when you go around the world you see a

706
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,870
bunch of zones that are above average

707
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:47,100
and you see a bunch of zones that are

708
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:49,770
below average and they even out like

709
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,990
mathematically all of this should kind

710
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:56,430
of equal itself out and you should have

711
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:58,530
an earth that's just average with global

712
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:01,230
warming what we're talking about is that

713
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:03,840
average is very slowly creeping up and

714
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,610
up but I bring this up because it comes

715
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,610
up in the news a lot where people will

716
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:10,980
say oh it's so hot today it's that

717
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,750
global warming no that's not vogel

718
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,340
warming means it's not a day-to-day

719
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:18,030
thing that you can recognize it's a

720
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:19,770
long-term trend or politicians will say

721
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,720
oh it's cold and it's snowing out here

722
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,200
and it's May global warming must be a

723
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,270
hoax

724
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,100
no you're mixing up two different air

725
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,130
masses has nothing to do with global

726
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,900
warming so people that are both believe

727
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,960
in it and that people that don't believe

728
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:37,650
in it still use this erroneously as an

729
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,200
argument on either side so one way to

730
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,450
think about global warming is to think

731
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,640
about a bell curve most places where you

732
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,800
live on earth especially once you get

733
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,100
away from the equator and you're up in

734
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,230
higher latitudes is that for any

735
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,690
particular place we have a number of

736
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,289
days you

737
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:59,870
we've got a few hot super hot days we've

738
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:02,799
got a few super cold days and everything

739
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:05,389
else kind of fits into a bell curve and

740
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,919
the bell curve might be extra fat it

741
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:08,929
might be extra narrow just depends on

742
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,299
the climate of where you live but the

743
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:14,090
point is most of our days kind of fall

744
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,549
in here with a few extremes over here

745
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,769
and a few extremes over here so I'm

746
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:22,850
gonna draw a little line here to

747
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:26,149
represent hot outliers and cold outliers

748
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:32,990
right so so this zone right here you

749
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:35,659
might consider this like your heat waves

750
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,419
right these are your you're really hot

751
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:42,519
events where you know some people die

752
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:47,330
from exposure to heat makes the news etc

753
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,100
okay so you expect that there's there's

754
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,139
gonna be a few maybe record-breaking

755
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,789
cold events a few record-breaking hot

756
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:57,289
events but most days are kind of in the

757
00:32:52,789 --> 00:33:00,049
middle now let's say I shift the climate

758
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:02,690
just a couple of degrees right it's the

759
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,970
earth gets warmer three degrees what's

760
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,620
the big deal three degrees it might be

761
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,299
warmer three degrees tomorrow might be

762
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,850
colder three degrees tomorrow nobody

763
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:13,039
knows the difference who cares what that

764
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,100
really means first of all it's a global

765
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,440
average so as we saw in the previous

766
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:20,299
section parts of the earth are going to

767
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,100
get much much much warmer than that that

768
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:23,720
three degrees whereas a lot of it may be

769
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,399
around the equator doesn't change at all

770
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,529
but let's just say for this particular

771
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:31,100
location I increase the temperature

772
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:33,970
three degrees what that means is that

773
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,590
this whole curve is being shifted over

774
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:39,710
three degrees okay so I'm going to

775
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:42,669
redraw this but as a dotted line now or

776
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,669
it's been shifted over

777
00:33:50,340 --> 00:34:02,679
okay so this right here that's our three

778
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:06,309
degree increase okay so we've shifted

779
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,520
the average over three degrees what does

780
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:14,530
that do to these extremes though these

781
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:18,399
tails notice what happens to our tail of

782
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:20,049
cold events on this new dashed line we

783
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,200
basically don't have them anymore

784
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:25,450
we're losing those cold events the

785
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,429
record-breaking cold events when you did

786
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,530
your climate change assignment where you

787
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,879
you went and you look one of the things

788
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,579
that we saw when we go back like a

789
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,429
hundred years is that starting like in

790
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:38,669
the 90s we start losing those colder

791
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:42,280
winters right well this is this is why

792
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:44,859
now the other thing that happens is how

793
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,889
many of these hot events do we now have

794
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:55,000
so if I shifted this curve over I now

795
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:57,700
have a much broader area of these hot

796
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,549
events so by just shifting this over a

797
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,640
little bit I increase the area under the

798
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:06,730
curve for this tail and I decrease the

799
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,579
area under the curve for this tail so as

800
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:12,640
humans what this means is we get a lot

801
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:15,010
more of these dangerous hot events a lot

802
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,829
more of these heat waves so this is why

803
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,849
it's a little deceptive when people say

804
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:22,240
temperature's increases three degrees

805
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:24,970
Fahrenheit natural reaction is big deal

806
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,190
but it's the whole average that's

807
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,220
shifting three degrees and it's this

808
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,109
tail that we worry about because now

809
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,140
we've got more of these hot de Vence

810
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:37,480
than we used to have so we can already

811
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,400
see the consequence of these additional

812
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,520
heat events around the world and one

813
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,559
thing to keep in mind when we talk about

814
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,559
climate change is that the people who

815
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,990
are the most affected are not us here in

816
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,670
the United States and we have this we're

817
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,790
kind of spoiled with our infrastructure

818
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:56,410
right if so if it's extra hot we just

819
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,450
turn on our air conditioners on but a

820
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,250
lot of the world can't do that and it's

821
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,880
kind of astonishing how many people die

822
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:05,259
from these extreme heat events so these

823
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,890
slides I'm going to show you or just

824
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:10,900
some stories from 2015 I could update

825
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,400
them and give you some more stories for

826
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,119
this year but these are the slides that

827
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,369
I had and so for example in 2015

828
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,250
you know heatwave in India kills over

829
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:23,170
2,000 people right like that's nuts we

830
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:27,460
would never see something like that here

831
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:32,529
in the US Pakistan heatwave that same

832
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:34,779
year kills 1200 people you know that we

833
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:38,799
didn't get into heat index in this

834
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:41,440
country or in this class but if you have

835
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:44,069
high relative humidities and you add to

836
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,269
that high temperatures you can produce

837
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:48,309
you know it feels like it's hotter than

838
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:55,960
it really is and we call that heat index

839
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:57,819
so that year Iran hit 163 degrees heat

840
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,990
index so what that means it is it felt

841
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:01,539
like there's a hundred sixty-three

842
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,039
degrees outside so that was a

843
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:06,849
combination of the high temperatures and

844
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:09,309
high humidity that they had heat wave

845
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,779
hit Europe people died again but not in

846
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:14,529
the numbers that we saw in some of those

847
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:16,869
other countries hits Japan when this

848
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:21,369
story was run that 55 people died

849
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:23,670
eventually that would become 90 so heat

850
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:26,349
waves are you know have real-world

851
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:30,329
consequences and thousands of people

852
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:33,430
actually died from these each year also

853
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:34,990
another consequence of climate change is

854
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,329
that you're getting flooding in places

855
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,859
that aren't used to it you're also to be

856
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:40,539
fair getting droughts in place that

857
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:42,910
aren't places that aren't used to it as

858
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:44,559
we kind of briefly talked about in the

859
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,140
past we're shifting weather patterns

860
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,480
around a little bit as we change the

861
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,059
climate and so there's human

862
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,789
consequences for these flooding events

863
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:57,279
where you know millions of people are

864
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:59,640
having to leave their homes and there

865
00:37:57,279 --> 00:38:02,789
are death tolls and in the hundreds

866
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:06,309
often or these places flood and again

867
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:08,950
we're not really used to this I mean how

868
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:10,269
far back do you have to go to find you

869
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,039
know a hundred people in the United

870
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:14,109
States died from the flood doesn't

871
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,990
happen very often but in other parts of

872
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:19,030
the world you're not nearly as lucky all

873
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,580
so getting flooding in places that you'd

874
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,650
never expect much rain at all so again

875
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:29,530
this is the all these stories worth from

876
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:32,140
2015 and in Egypt Alexandria so the

877
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:34,360
caption says Alexandria would usually

878
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,119
only expect to see five millimeters of

879
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,250
rain during the entire month right and

880
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,890
this one event they got you know what

881
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,330
equivalent of several inches of rain

882
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:47,080
that flooded this area so many

883
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:50,410
centimeters of rain now we saw this

884
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,500
image once before which is a record of

885
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,180
number of hours of flooding per year in

886
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,250
a neighborhood near the coast and we

887
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:01,480
talked about how this is partly due to

888
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:03,490
rising sea levels you know there are

889
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,830
several places in the world where the

890
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:09,910
land is pretty close to sea level and

891
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:14,260
Bangladesh is one of them and we

892
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:16,690
expected 17% of the landmass of

893
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,190
Bangladesh will be underwater in the

894
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,920
next 40 years and that's going to

895
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,240
displace 18 million people all right so

896
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,400
this is a country that's you know it's

897
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,160
built on a delta it's very flat very

898
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,130
near sea level so the sea goes up just a

899
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:32,560
little bit - floods a very broad area 40

900
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,000
I mean 18 million people that's a lot of

901
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,980
people are gonna have to go somewhere

902
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,270
this woman is standing where her house

903
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:41,710
used to be before it got washed away

904
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,480
another consequence of climate change

905
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,980
and by the way we're just going through

906
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,380
you know these are things that are in

907
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,660
your book that your book talks about and

908
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:53,310
in like the first half of your book or

909
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:56,260
whatever more wildfire so the warmer you

910
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:58,270
make the earth the lower the relative

911
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,930
humidity the lower the relative humidity

912
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:04,510
the more chance of fires and so again

913
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,850
this is I went through is these slides

914
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,520
this one in particular year 2015 and

915
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:12,070
just got all the stories about the

916
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,780
record-breaking wildfires and I could do

917
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,340
this the year after the year after the

918
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,510
year after and you still get the same

919
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:22,330
stories so this on this particular year

920
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:25,660
we had record-breaking wildfires burning

921
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:29,050
eight million acres northwest wildfire

922
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,910
fires northwestern us that is break

923
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:34,210
records for size and cost

924
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:38,799
The Australian's battle the worst bush

925
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:40,750
fires for last 30 years and so again

926
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:42,460
pretty much every year it's the same

927
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:48,490
cycle and news stories that are coming

928
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:51,250
out here's kind of a strange graph is

929
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,510
this is from Australia and it says

930
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,230
number of days

931
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:58,690
hotter than 99% of all days ever

932
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:01,960
recorded right so if we go back to the

933
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:05,140
40's right so like this year right here

934
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:09,010
on what that is 1936 they had five days

935
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:12,640
that year that were hotter than 99% of

936
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:16,150
all days ever recorded and then compared

937
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,980
and again remember long-term changes is

938
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,500
what we're looking for in for climate

939
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,940
change there's you know years that are

940
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,549
clearly hotter and years that are

941
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,200
clearly colder but the overall trend is

942
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:28,960
that they're seeing more and more of

943
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,900
these years where they have more and

944
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,849
more record-breaking hot days right so

945
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,529
this last one on this graph you know

946
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,829
they looks like they've got about 27

947
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:43,240
days that were hotter than 99% of all

948
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:45,520
days ever recorded so sometimes people

949
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,799
use this term extreme weather I don't

950
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,410
like that term because who knows exactly

951
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:52,420
what you consider extreme but I know

952
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,279
this gets in the news a lot and I think

953
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,460
your book refers to it so I throw this

954
00:41:54,279 --> 00:42:00,400
in here the number of extreme weather

955
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,529
events has been going up and up this is

956
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,329
again usually attributed to climate

957
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:06,520
change but it's a little fuzzy as to

958
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,799
exactly what's going on here and what

959
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,450
counts as extreme weather so I don't

960
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:12,460
really like to get into that too much

961
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:16,690
but I thought I would throw that in

962
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:20,079
there so a more important idea is the

963
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:21,910
threats to agriculture and the world's

964
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,640
food supply and one of the things we've

965
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,410
got to realize here is that here in the

966
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,660
United States we've got this factory

967
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:31,119
farming system we're making more food

968
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:34,779
than we can use and we export a lot of

969
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,960
it but a lot of the world does not have

970
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:39,910
that and in fact the the farmers that

971
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,710
are going to experience you know the

972
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,290
worst consequences from climate change

973
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:46,240
are the little farmers so here

974
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,090
stars as small farmers in Africa will

975
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,950
experience the worst of climate change

976
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:53,500
small holders with less than five acres

977
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:59,470
produce much of the world Lord's food

978
00:42:53,500 --> 00:43:01,540
and and so when you have a shifting you

979
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,280
know shifting precipitation patterns or

980
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:05,830
it's now it's getting warm more of these

981
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,100
warm events you're gonna see a lot of

982
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:11,020
crop failure ah on a small scale so in

983
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,880
other words here in the United States if

984
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,400
we go into a drought well we could drill

985
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,160
a well we could pump water right I mean

986
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,660
there's things that we can do but a lot

987
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,270
of the world can't do that they don't

988
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,130
have the infrastructure to do that so so

989
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:27,610
we're gonna see a lot of crop failure

990
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:29,560
and the places that can't afford it the

991
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,450
most and it's worth pointing out that

992
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,120
the world is not necessarily getting as

993
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:35,440
much to eat as they would like and this

994
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,620
is again something that we don't think

995
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,950
about a lot in our country this is a map

996
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,930
of hunger so white means you got plenty

997
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:46,660
to eat no problem

998
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:49,210
the dark green means that maybe there's

999
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,580
a few you know maybe five percent or so

1000
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,460
or less of the population that's not

1001
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,860
getting enough to eat and then as you

1002
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,600
start to get into these other colors you

1003
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:01,530
start to get I come into the red where

1004
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:05,140
over 20 percent of the population is

1005
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:07,360
basically starving and you so you see a

1006
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,820
lot of hunger say in central Africa well

1007
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,010
we just said that that's the part of the

1008
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:15,880
world that's going to be the meal the

1009
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:18,190
most danger most at risk for crop

1010
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,800
failure as climate change starts to set

1011
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,360
in so you're taking us an area of the

1012
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,490
world that's already hurting for a food

1013
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,560
supply and you're gonna make it worse

1014
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,000
once you start changing precipitation

1015
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:34,510
patterns and adding these additional

1016
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,970
heat events number 6 on our list would

1017
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:39,940
be threats to livelihood and so we saw

1018
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:41,740
in those previous climate animate

1019
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,070
climate change animations that the

1020
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:47,500
predictions that the northern you know

1021
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:50,620
up in the Arctic that that part is going

1022
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,770
to be affected the most most of all by

1023
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:56,620
future climate change has already

1024
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,530
received the most change up till now and

1025
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,810
it's going to contain

1026
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,090
that way in the future so there's a lot

1027
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:05,060
of coaches like the Inuit that their

1028
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:07,760
livelihood depends on the present say of

1029
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,380
ice and they're gonna have to do

1030
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,660
something different because that ice is

1031
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,580
no longer gonna be there and we saw in

1032
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,230
that one prediction that it was going to

1033
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:19,310
you know this area was gonna increase by

1034
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:21,680
25 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100

1035
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:24,050
so something's gonna have to really

1036
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,100
change here in the in their livelihood

1037
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:29,030
in the okay last on our list of

1038
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:32,780
consequences of climate change are

1039
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:34,730
threats to ecosystems and this diagram

1040
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,680
was in your book and it's kind of

1041
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,380
confusing I want to go over this a

1042
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:43,760
little bit so the idea is that groups of

1043
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:45,530
organisms can migrate and part of this

1044
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,410
is common sense that if you're a big

1045
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,870
animal and you need to move you just get

1046
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:55,040
up and go but other groups of organisms

1047
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:58,670
can also migrate at a much lower rate so

1048
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,390
for example trees can migrate now how

1049
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,960
would they do that

1050
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:05,750
well tree grows up propagate seeds the

1051
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,580
seeds then start a new tree which then

1052
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,040
propagates seeds which in start a new

1053
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,080
tree in that forest as a whole could

1054
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,780
move in one direction or the other if it

1055
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:22,100
had to and so if you look at a range on

1056
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:24,650
this graph of all trees the slowest

1057
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,840
trees could propagate so on the waxes

1058
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,540
that says maximum speed at which species

1059
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:32,510
can move in kilometers per decade right

1060
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:35,450
so this is 20 so right in the middle of

1061
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:38,390
be about 10 so this bar represents all

1062
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,400
trees in the world and the speediest

1063
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,880
trees looks like they could propagate it

1064
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,950
maybe 15 kilometers per decade slows

1065
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,600
trees maybe I don't know half a

1066
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,480
kilometer per decade something like that

1067
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,620
the black bar is what is the median so

1068
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,140
you can think like that's where most

1069
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,700
trees are so it looks like most trees

1070
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,820
might be able to propagate about a

1071
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,890
kilometer per decade right so if you got

1072
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,410
a compa trees and they've got to stay in

1073
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:06,170
a certain temperature range to survive

1074
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,680
and then the climate is going to change

1075
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:11,450
could the trees move fast enough to get

1076
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,320
to a cooler area

1077
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:16,550
to survive or any of these other

1078
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:20,780
organisms right so if you think of like

1079
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:24,140
a squirrel so a squirrel could get up

1080
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:27,890
and and go except it has to stay within

1081
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:29,810
its habitat in order to survive right so

1082
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,790
let's say you got a compa trees and

1083
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:34,340
surrounding the clump of trees is I

1084
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:36,170
don't know a prairie and for whatever

1085
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,140
reason the squirrels have to live in the

1086
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,880
trees well the squirrels cannot migrate

1087
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,160
any faster than the trees so the trees

1088
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,980
are slowly propagating in one direction

1089
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,620
then the squirrels are propagating at

1090
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,300
the same speed as the trees right they

1091
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,210
can't go any faster than the trees or

1092
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:55,310
they will run out of habitat so let's

1093
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,440
imagine I have two clumps of trees here

1094
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:00,590
I've got one clump that's on a pretty

1095
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,850
flat you know pretty flat ground I get

1096
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:08,000
another clump that's near some pretty

1097
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:12,680
steep terrain so if I change the

1098
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,420
temperature I make things warmer so if

1099
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,090
these trees are going to survive they

1100
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:20,960
need to get to a higher elevation okay

1101
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:23,600
so these guys don't have to maybe they

1102
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,330
only have to go up just a little bit

1103
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,650
maybe to here to get to the cooler

1104
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:32,600
temperature and then there would be fine

1105
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:37,160
right so maybe this this batch only has

1106
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:38,960
to migrate up to here let's say and

1107
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,880
they'll be in cooler temperatures and

1108
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,330
they'll be fine

1109
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:46,520
this group has to go up you know to get

1110
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:48,980
this change in elevation let's say it's

1111
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,660
a centimeter on my map maybe that means

1112
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:55,580
that this group has got to get to about

1113
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:58,850
here to be the same distance you know

1114
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:02,030
that same increase in elevation to get

1115
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:05,210
to here so that they can survive but of

1116
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:07,640
course this is a very long area for them

1117
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:10,060
to migrate so the point is is if you

1118
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,460
have a group of organisms or forest

1119
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:15,590
that's on flat land they're going to

1120
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,540
have to travel a much longer distance to

1121
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,100
get to a cooler temperature then if you

1122
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,080
had a group of organisms that would say

1123
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:24,630
on the side of the hill these guys don't

1124
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,980
have to go very far to get to higher to

1125
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,050
to get to higher elevation for the

1126
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,280
cooler temperatures this groups got to

1127
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:35,280
go much farther to get to an equivalent

1128
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:38,370
elevation gain okay so with that idea

1129
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,370
let's go back to this graph so we're

1130
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:43,440
going back to these our CP predictions

1131
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:50,100
right the scenarios the emission

1132
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:51,690
scenarios so if I had a our CP 2.6

1133
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,640
remember that's the best possible

1134
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:57,780
scenario that's this in your book it's

1135
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:00,210
the purple one on here what it says is

1136
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:03,150
if we had our CP 2.6 it says fought

1137
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,910
areas in global average this is the rate

1138
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:09,330
at which the earth is going to warm and

1139
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:12,000
what we see is pretty much most of the

1140
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:15,390
organisms on this graph can migrate

1141
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,250
faster than that so that's good news the

1142
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,860
earth is going to warm a little bit but

1143
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:22,470
most most organisms including those on

1144
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:26,100
flat areas will be able to go faster

1145
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:30,270
than the warming and will survive but

1146
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:34,380
let's say we have our CP 6.0 so back on

1147
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:37,380
here our CP 6.0 that is the orange one

1148
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:40,380
okay and so this is not as Extreme as

1149
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:43,950
the sort of business as usual scenario

1150
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,770
8.5 it's somewhere in between so let's

1151
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:49,860
just say that this is the future our CP

1152
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:53,340
6.0 that's the emission scenario that

1153
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:56,060
happens and the earth warms up

1154
00:50:53,340 --> 00:51:00,030
accordingly and so what this is saying

1155
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:03,330
it says our CP 6.0 global average this

1156
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:08,040
is the rate at which the earth will warm

1157
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:11,220
and organisms that are below this line

1158
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:13,950
will not be able to move fast enough to

1159
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:16,200
escape the warming organisms that are

1160
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:19,200
above this line will be able to go fast

1161
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,750
enough to get to to cooler areas so of

1162
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,910
all the trees in the world the trees

1163
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:27,540
that fall up in this zone will be able

1164
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:29,970
to accelerate fast enough to go beat you

1165
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,700
know to get to higher elevations to

1166
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:34,740
cooler temperatures the the trees that

1167
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,930
are below us all the species below here

1168
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:41,190
won't be able to do that and will

1169
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:44,160
we go extinct up here says RCP 6.0 flat

1170
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:47,730
areas so any organisms that are stuck

1171
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,500
out in the in the flat areas there

1172
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,480
they're in trouble because they're not

1173
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:54,600
going to be able to accelerate the the

1174
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,670
warming fast enough so all these guys

1175
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,530
would go extinct in that scenario if

1176
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:01,050
they were stuck out in the flattens in

1177
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,690
the flat areas these types of organisms

1178
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:06,750
would be okay because they could

1179
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:09,210
conceivably move faster than this amount

1180
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:11,340
of warming or if you go to the 8.5

1181
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,570
remember the 8.5 that's the worst case

1182
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,190
scenario that's the business-as-usual

1183
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:18,000
that's the one we're probably on right

1184
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:21,390
now so we move from this line to this

1185
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,450
line so again any organisms that fall

1186
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:26,550
below this red line means that they were

1187
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:29,550
not going to move fast enough to outpace

1188
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:31,410
the warming and then here's the flat

1189
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,620
area so any organisms that's out on the

1190
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:37,290
flat area below this line will not

1191
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:40,800
survive so that's I think is kind of a

1192
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:42,680
confusing diagram to explain this but

1193
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,670
all you got to know here is that

1194
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,010
different groups of organisms can

1195
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:48,660
migrate at different speeds sometimes

1196
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,460
it's just the speed of the organism

1197
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:53,430
itself it can just pick up and walk off

1198
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,840
sometimes it's the speed of the habitat

1199
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,700
in which the organism lives

1200
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,620
so again if you're a squirrel and you

1201
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,690
live in the trees you can oil migrate as

1202
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:03,720
fast as the trees at the forest itself

1203
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:05,940
is migrating and in these different

1204
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,070
emission scenarios the earth is going to

1205
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,800
warm at different rates and so the

1206
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:13,770
question is as a group of organisms can

1207
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,350
you outpace the warming and to get to a

1208
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:19,290
cooler area in time if you live near a

1209
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:21,870
hill high elevation it doesn't take as

1210
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:24,210
long to get to up to a cooler spot if

1211
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:26,550
you live where it's flat you got a long

1212
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:28,650
long ways to go to finally get to say a

1213
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:31,820
higher latitude or something you have a

1214
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:34,650
much much lower chance of surviving

1215
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:38,370
there's one graph on your book on page

1216
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:41,640
50 that is pretty important but I don't

1217
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:43,950
think they quite point out how important

1218
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,260
it is so what it's showing is that's

1219
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:49,380
showing global average temperatures back

1220
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,340
to 20,000 BC and you see that they rise

1221
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,160
up we're coming out

1222
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,750
an ice age and then and by the way the

1223
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,580
ice age was due to changes in the

1224
00:53:54,750 --> 00:54:00,000
Earth's orbit right but that happens

1225
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:02,550
very slowly and then there's this thing

1226
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,110
it says the Holocene maximum and you see

1227
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:07,370
it kind of dive down a little bit and

1228
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:10,610
all of a sudden it takes off and this is

1229
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:13,320
you know the trajectory that we're on

1230
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:14,940
okay so the point of this is that the

1231
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,090
amount of warming that we're seeing

1232
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:20,010
right now is very rapid compared to what

1233
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:22,470
we've seen in the past but I want to

1234
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,510
talk about this part of the graph and in

1235
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:28,230
in I'm going to show you a different

1236
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:31,490
version of this and this is the graph

1237
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:33,600
that I generally show my class and

1238
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:36,750
there's some confusing things here so

1239
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,610
let's just simplify on the y-axis think

1240
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,810
of this is temperature okay something

1241
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:44,240
called Delta o-18

1242
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:47,970
in it's something that's chemically

1243
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,180
removed from shells to reconstruct

1244
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:54,780
temperatures does not worry about that

1245
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:56,730
point is if you go back these are this

1246
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,430
is a hundred thousand years ago right 80

1247
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:02,400
thousand years ago we see some pretty

1248
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:04,620
crazy changes in the Earth's climate

1249
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,200
right we've got warm periods we got cold

1250
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,880
periods we got back to warm periods so

1251
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,830
what you might say is that we're kind of

1252
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:16,350
in these you know ice ages or in between

1253
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:18,780
ice ages and there's a lot of craziness

1254
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:20,580
right a lot of wild swings in the

1255
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,430
Earth's or in the Earth's climate and we

1256
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:26,130
don't necessarily all agree on what's

1257
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:28,380
causing these big swings in the Earth's

1258
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:31,380
climate some of its orbit some of it may

1259
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:35,040
not be but here's the strange thing

1260
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:39,180
about 10,000 years ago the climate

1261
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:43,500
suddenly gets really calm and it gets

1262
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:47,220
and it turns flat okay and we are living

1263
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:51,750
at the end of this flat zone now as

1264
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:55,020
humans we need agriculture to survive

1265
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:57,540
and it turns out that the beginning of

1266
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:01,560
Agriculture was about 10,000 years ago

1267
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:03,480
and there's a hypothesis that humans

1268
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:06,540
could not develop

1269
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:09,030
culture until the climate kind of

1270
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,690
settled down so we went so the earth

1271
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:14,280
ghost is pretty crazy period and then

1272
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:16,710
for whatever reason tends to calm down

1273
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,230
and again climate scientists are not a

1274
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:21,030
hundred percent certain why why this

1275
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:23,369
actually happened why did we go creek

1276
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:28,890
from crazy town to this kind of nice

1277
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:31,740
calm period but here's the fear the fear

1278
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:34,200
is as we talked about in the previous

1279
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:36,000
lecture about greenhouse gases that

1280
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,030
we've suddenly just injected a ton of

1281
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,770
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere

1282
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:42,540
that aren't supposed to be there and

1283
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:44,280
we've put more greenhouse gases into the

1284
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:48,119
atmosphere now than the earth has seen

1285
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:50,970
in the last million years so the analogy

1286
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:53,790
is often that we're poking a sleeping

1287
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:56,040
bear right the atmosphere was going

1288
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:59,130
along just fine climate was nice and

1289
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,350
kind of flat no crazy stuff and then the

1290
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:04,109
humans come along and they start adding

1291
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:08,010
all this co2 and other greenhouse gases

1292
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:10,200
and one of the big big questions that we

1293
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:12,540
have is climate scientists and the

1294
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,890
public doesn't really ever this has

1295
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:19,440
really never discussed is we don't know

1296
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:21,930
what's keeping the climate that constant

1297
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,880
over the past 10,000 years and we

1298
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:26,220
especially don't know how it's going to

1299
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,710
react to all of this extra greenhouse

1300
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:31,200
gases when we poke the bear what is

1301
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:34,320
going to happen and it's quite possible

1302
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:37,410
that the climate system could return to

1303
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,750
crazytown over here again and we just

1304
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:43,560
don't know in our climate models that

1305
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:45,119
we've we've been talking about we you

1306
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,010
know and all the tools that we have as

1307
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,980
climate scientists there's still a level

1308
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:52,350
uncertainty of what is actually going to

1309
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,630
happen in the future it's pretty easy to

1310
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:56,490
predict that things will get warmer what

1311
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,800
we don't know is whether things will

1312
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:03,359
come crashing down soon after like it

1313
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:05,070
did in the past so the biggest fear

1314
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,450
about climate change and again this is

1315
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,520
not really something that most people

1316
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,410
you know that the public doesn't know

1317
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,240
about this too much that's not really in

1318
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:16,620
the news it's not even that much in your

1319
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:19,170
book is that we don't know how

1320
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:22,500
along this calm period this last 10,000

1321
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:24,990
year long calm period we don't know how

1322
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,970
long this is gonna last and we don't

1323
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:29,490
know what its gonna happen after that

1324
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,320
but we're pretty sure that if we keep

1325
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:33,810
adding greenhouse gases to the

1326
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,480
atmosphere that something is probably

1327
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:40,230
going to change we just don't know how

1328
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:43,110
it's going to change so I've talked from

1329
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:45,960
time to time about how climate change is

1330
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:47,790
very politicized and I thought I'd in

1331
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,530
this class talking a little bit more

1332
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:54,150
about that because you may not realize

1333
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:55,800
quite what's what's been going on so I I

1334
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:58,440
work with a lot of teachers in New

1335
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,910
Mexico like K through 12 teachers and in

1336
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,920
K through 12 they're supposed to teach

1337
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:04,920
weather and climate that's part of the

1338
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,300
new science standards and I work with

1339
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,040
some teachers to try to help them

1340
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,280
understand weather and climate better so

1341
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:14,550
that they can teach it so this is a book

1342
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,830
that many of my teachers have received

1343
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:20,250
in the mail and it says why scientists

1344
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:24,260
disagree about global warming so the

1345
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:27,600
title by itself is a huge lie because

1346
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:30,270
I'm a client climate scientist I've gone

1347
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:33,300
to many climate scientist meetings where

1348
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:36,660
there might be thousands of scientists

1349
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:38,970
present nobody's disagreeing that global

1350
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,920
warming is happening what we disagree

1351
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:43,080
about are they are the minut details

1352
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,990
especially like projections into the

1353
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,520
future so by the year 2100 how much is

1354
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:49,740
it how much is the temperature going to

1355
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,440
change that's where the disagreement

1356
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,240
lies or maybe when we look at paleo

1357
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,130
climate and we see shifts in the climate

1358
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,510
like a hundred thousand years ago you

1359
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,520
know we disagree about the reasons for

1360
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:02,400
that no one's disagreeing about what's

1361
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,120
happening today okay so the title is an

1362
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,480
outright lie

1363
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,270
and you'll also see that this second

1364
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,420
sentence is there's a little trickery

1365
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:15,300
afoot here it says the nipcc report on

1366
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:17,940
scientific consensus remember the IPCC

1367
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:22,740
we learned who they were so this is the

1368
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:25,260
n IPCC the not the IPCC but this book

1369
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:27,600
was printed up by a conservative group

1370
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:28,770
and distributed to they printed up over

1371
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,329
a hundred thousand of them and they

1372
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:33,679
tried to mail into every teach

1373
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:36,299
in the country and the whole point is to

1374
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:39,660
generate misinformation about climate

1375
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:41,339
change and to tried to produce doubt in

1376
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,779
the teachers that are actually supposed

1377
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:45,390
to be teaching the students about

1378
01:00:42,779 --> 01:00:49,170
weather and climate so this is an

1379
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:51,689
example of some of the misinformation

1380
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:53,309
that's going on there's a lot of money

1381
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:56,849
in the fossil fuel industry that are

1382
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:58,410
trying to fight the the scientists that

1383
01:00:56,849 --> 01:01:02,039
are trying to get the message out about

1384
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:03,299
climate change this is one example so a

1385
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,539
lot of the things that are going on for

1386
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:09,179
example they hired a lot of the same

1387
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:11,459
people that were represented tobacco

1388
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:14,729
companies in the 1980s so in the 1980s

1389
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:16,229
is kind of when people finally realized

1390
01:01:14,729 --> 01:01:19,079
that smoking was really bad for you and

1391
01:01:16,229 --> 01:01:22,049
they had all these scientists from the

1392
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:23,969
tobacco companies that were saying no no

1393
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:25,559
smoking's fine for you fine for you and

1394
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:27,569
there was a lot of misinformation that

1395
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:29,670
was generated to try to convince people

1396
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:31,650
that maybe smoking really wasn't bad for

1397
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:34,890
you a lot of those same people are

1398
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:38,249
actually now being hired to do this kind

1399
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:41,429
of work trying to refute climate change

1400
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:43,439
research you know all of the lectures

1401
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:47,279
that you've watched here have been

1402
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:50,099
posted on YouTube and usually I post one

1403
01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:51,749
up and you guys watch it and maybe a few

1404
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:54,479
other people watch it and maybe there's

1405
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:56,640
a comment or two or usually there's no

1406
01:01:54,479 --> 01:01:58,650
comments at all because I mean who cares

1407
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:01,349
right it's some guy in this cat talking

1408
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:04,829
about humidity nobody cares but as soon

1409
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:07,259
as I put the word climate change in the

1410
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:09,989
lecture title everything changed

1411
01:02:07,259 --> 01:02:12,599
and so a couple of lectures ago we had I

1412
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:15,420
had a lecture up about that just kind of

1413
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:18,439
reviewing stuff out of your book and had

1414
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:21,299
the word climate change in the title and

1415
01:02:18,439 --> 01:02:23,549
all of a sudden this army of trolls just

1416
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:28,589
came out of the woodwork and started

1417
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:31,529
making comments on my my lecture and all

1418
01:02:28,589 --> 01:02:35,009
of my other videos and started sending

1419
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:38,699
harassing emails messages to me and

1420
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:40,650
finally I had to actually hide a lot of

1421
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:42,269
our videos from in this class so that

1422
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:44,130
they couldn't comment on them and then

1423
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:48,570
also lay down with me

1424
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:51,150
and then also prevent them from leaving

1425
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:53,370
comments and just everything changed

1426
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:54,810
like as soon as I used as soon as I put

1427
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:57,360
in the words climate change or global

1428
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:59,610
warming then all these people came out

1429
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,800
that this whole army trolls came out to

1430
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:04,410
to attack me and attack this class so

1431
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:07,380
that's that's the world we're currently

1432
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:09,650
living in and maybe in a different

1433
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:12,000
administration that might change I

1434
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:15,390
suspect that it probably won't change

1435
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,580
for a long time but realize that this is

1436
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:19,410
a this is a topic that's highly

1437
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,110
politically charged and there's a lot of

1438
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:24,060
money to try to convince you that global

1439
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:27,740
