[0:02] [Music] hey how you doing this is Mel strong and this lecture is an introduction to humidity now before we get into humidity we're going to talk about the composition of Earth's atmosphere so this visual here represents the gases that make up Earth's atmosphere and it doesn't matter where you are the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is pretty much the same no matter where you go so the atmosphere is about 78%

[0:33] nitrogen in about 21% oxygen and about 1% argon and right there you're about 99.9% of all the gases in the atmosphere there's a little bit of co2 in a little tiny amount of everything else so before we go on let's talk a little bit about these gases because it's worth knowing a few things about them so with nitrogen what this visual is is saying is that

[1:03] right now you've got more nitrogen going in and out of your lungs than any other gas so my question is what is it doing for you and an answer is absolutely nothing because nitrogen is what we call an inert gas what that means is that it really doesn't react with anything and in order to get nitrogen to react with something you've got to have really high temperatures before any kind of reactions occur so as it goes in and

[1:33] out of your lungs you basically your body just ignores it now it turns out your body needs nitrogen but it can't get it this way and that'll come up later in future lectures so oxygen is that an inert gas oh no this is very reactive right and this is why we need it because it what we call oxidizes and so we need that for our respiration

[2:03] process the oxygen accepts electrons and gets converted in our body from oxygen to carbon dioxide argon is another inert gas and also very heavy so in other words it's a very dense gas maybe this is one you haven't heard of before but if you have seen thermal windows like double pane windows that are built to insulate in between the gas they usually put argon and the reason for that is because

[2:34] the gas molecules are so heavy they're really slow and they bump into each other very slowly and that's how heat is transferred so they argon gas makes pretty good insulation then we've got carbon dioxide and we're gonna talk all about carbon dioxide much later in the semester but this is a greenhouse gas so those gases right there make up I guess at 99.9% of all of the gases in

[3:04] the atmosphere so here's another way to look at that we could break this down and again you can see that there's nitrogen at seventy-eight percent oxygen about 21% argon a point nine percent add those three together you got 99.9% fact that's ninety nine point nine five percent or so and then all these little traces of gases and some of these you've heard of maybe some you have it all add up together so there's a little bit of other things in the atmosphere however

[3:34] of all the gases that are shown here there's one gas that you are breathing right now that's in the atmosphere right now and it's not on this list and that gas is water water has never shown in a graph like this or in a list of atmospheric gases and the reason is water vapor is considered a variable gas so that means that it could range from close to zero all the way up to maybe four percent in

[4:06] certain parts of the world if you're in New Mexico it usually ranges from about zero to maybe close to one percent of all the gases in the atmosphere so the reason it's not shown in the graphs that we've been looking at or the tables you might find is because all those numbers have to add up to and so if I go back to the previous graph I was just looking at here so all these numbers add up to exactly 100 so if I had 2 percent water those numbers

[4:37] wouldn't add up to a hundred I have to adjust them all or if I had one percent water then they wouldn't add up to 100 again and I have to adjust them all so what they do in all text books and all references with atmospheric gases as they call this the dry composition so dry gas composition of the atmosphere this is what all the gases of the composite of the atmosphere would look like if there were no water but there is water so you got to take that into account so that's why they never list water on these on these tables because it's always different from day to day

[5:07] and depends on where you live so humidity is a way that we describe how much water vapor is in the atmosphere and there's several ways to do it in this lecture we're going to learn two different ways to describe humidity in the next lecture we're going to learn 2/3 now the way that would probably make the most sense to you right now is to talk about the percentage of gases in the atmosphere that's water so we just talked about this how you could have zero to four percent of the gases in the atmosphere be water vapor turns out

[5:38] though that's actually not the way we usually do it the first method that we're really going to get into is something called mixing ratio and mixing ratio describes how many grams of water vapor there are in every kilogram of air and it's often written as a fraction so here we have mixing ratio equals grams of water vapor on as a numerator and kilograms of air as a denominator now the conventional way to do this is to

[6:08] think about a single kilogram of air so I box up some air enough that I have one kilogram and I want to know in that box how many grams of water vapor do I have so that's kind of the way we're going to think about this so you might see mixing ratio written something like this mixing ratio is three grams per kilogram or three grams per kilogram and the Assumption here is that you know that grams means grams of water vapor

[6:39] kilogramme means kilograms of air okay now the thing is before we get any further I want to make sure that we can visualize what this means what does it actually like what does a gram of water vapor look like and what does a kilogram of air actually look like okay so we're gonna talk a little bit first about the metric system so in the metric system when they were inventing it they said if

[7:09] you have a cube and the cube is exactly one centimeter on each side one centimeter on each side okay one centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter the volume of that is one cubic centimeter okay and it turns out if I fill this cube with water that I will have a mass of exactly one gram so one gram of water would look like AK you

[7:40] could fill up a cube that's one centimeter on each side so what is a physical object that you can think of that's about this big so there's a couple of them I can think of one would be like a sugar cube what I usually show everybody or dice so a standard die is about one centimeter on each side so one gram of water would look like what machen if these were little ice cubes right each one of these would be about one gram of water so when we talk about

[8:12] say back to this three grams the mixing ratios three grams per kilogram that three grams means three grams of water vapor think about okay I'm gonna take water vapor that's in the air I'm going to condense it down to a blob and that blob in this case I would have three of these guys I could fill up three of these little cubes with water that way that's what three grams of water looks like all right so before we

[8:45] move on to the kilogram of air let's just talk a little bit more about the metric system because also when they came up with a system one cubics in the centimeter has another name it's called the milliliter our ml and the end if you have a thousand milliliters that equals one liter okay so that's going to come up here in

[9:16] a little bit okay so back to our initial problem I wanted you to be able to visualize what does this mean this three grams per kilogram what does that mean and the top so we've said the top is three with all ice cubes each the size of a of a die the bottom I want you to visualize a box and the box has one

[9:50] kilogram of air in it and the question is how big would that box be because we don't think about air as having much mass like we we don't even think about the weight of the air above us but it has some and so it turns out at our altitude so here in Albuquerque were about a mile mile above sea level it turns out that if you had a box it's about a meter by meter by a meter that would be about one kilogram of air okay

[10:21] see so you fill this up one meter by one meter by one meter that's one cubic meter so how big is a meter think about a doorknob you reach out to grab a doorknob and the doorknob is about one meter above the ground okay so that's a meter so imagine a box that big on each side that's a kilogram of air okay so now imagine this box is now made of plexiglass and so it's plastic you can see through it and there's a little door in it okay and we have

[10:52] filled our box with perfectly dry air but I'm going to open up the little door and I'm going to throw in three little ice cubes okay so I got three grams of water I got one kilogram of air I'm gonna open up the door I'm gonna throw my three grams of ice in there and close the door and so my little ice cubes fall to the bottom of the box and let's say the box is perfectly sealed and then they melt so I got for you all the puddles right I got through though the puddles sitting

[11:23] here at the bottom of water and then they evaporate so I come back later and the these three little puddles have completely evaporated so the air that's in there has a mixing ratio of three grams per kilogram we just made it right we took a kilogram of air we took three grams of water we stuck it in there we let it melt and evaporate and it's floating around in there and water molecules by the way the oxygen is pretty big compared to the hydrogen's

[11:54] and the hydrogens stick on one side of it so they look like these Mickey Mouse heads so you have to kind of imagine you've got this box now with these Mickey Mouse heads floating around in there these all the water molecules right we'll see more of this in a little bit okay so imagine I open up the little door now and let's say I've got a little cup like a little coffee cup and I reach in there and a scoop out and I pull out some of that air what's the mixing ratio

[12:24] of the air inside my cup it turns out ratios stay the same they're independent of size okay so if I take a little bit of that air the mixing ratio of the little bit of air that I got out of that box is still three grams per kilogram okay so you've got to separate out the ratios from the absolute amounts of water so with mixing ratio there's a number of problems that we can do with

[12:55] this and I'm gonna work out a couple of examples here so here's one it says mixing ratio is four grams per kilogram how much water do we have total in five kilograms of air okay so if I show this problem the people generally half the people I show this to think that they should multiply these two numbers and the other half think they should divide these two numbers and neither one can usually give me a very good reason why so the problems

[13:27] like this I want you to visualize go back to thinking about a kilogram of air as a box a box of air right so I've got one kilogram of air is a box that we said was a meter on each side all right okay so if I one box and the mixing ratio is four grams per kilogram I have four grams inside that box right now if I have five

[13:59] kilograms I essentially have five boxes so think about okay so that's one box but then I got another one right and then I got another one and so on and so forth each one of these has four grams in it so if I've got five of them total then I can multiply it should make sense to you that can multiply four times five for the total amount of water so I'll

[14:29] write this out with just the unit's here so I would take my mixing ratio for grams per kilogram multiply that by the number of kilograms I have in this case I have five I'll put that over one and if I do it if I write it out this way that unit kilogram cancels that unit kilogram four times five is 20 and grams are the units that I have left so by

[15:00] writing out this way I can see which you know what I hope is that the unit's that I don't want to cancel leaving mean the unit's that I do want that's an indication that I probably did it right so I'll do another one so when this one says the mixing ratio is 12 grams per kilogram so that might be a value that we would have here in the summer during our monsoon season how much water is in this room okay so let's just imagine we're in a room and here's the dimensions of the room five meters by three meters by 12 meters so what I

[15:33] need to know to answer this is how many kilograms of air do I have and I know that at our altitude here at Albuquerque one kilogram of air is about one cubic meter so in order to answer this I need to know how many cubic meters I have therefore that will tell me how many kilograms I have okay so this is a volume problem and volume is length times width times height so I'm gonna take five meters times three meters

[16:04] times 12 meters and I do that calculation five times three times 12 I get a hundred and 80 cubic meters okay so that tells me because one cubic meter of air is one kilogram that I have a hundred and eighty kilograms of air in that room so now it's just like the last

[16:35] problem I have a hundred and eighty boxes of air each box has 12 grams of water vapor in it so to get the total water I take my mixing ratio and multiply it by the number of kilograms of air that I have so again it's like 180 boxes of air each box has 12 grams in it write it up this way you should

[17:05] see that units you don't want go away and they in the unit's you do want are left so I end up with 12 times 80 I'm sorry 12 times 180 and that gives me two thousand one hundred and sixty grams okay so I want I want you to be able to visualize what this means okay so this is the total amount of water so if we condensed all the water out of the room right though all the water molecules in

[17:35] this room we condense it out we would have two thousand one hundred and sixty grams well just a minute ago I told you that so a gram of water equals one milliliter or one cubic centimeter right so that's the same thing as saying two thousand one hundred and sixty milliliters of water that's the same thing and can you visualize what that is well a thousand milliliters are in a wieder so two thousand milliliters is

[18:07] two liters so if I divide this by a thousand I get two point one six liters so think of a two liter bottle right we have filled up a two liter bottle and we've got a little bit left over that's how much water we would have if we were to condense all the water out of this room on this particular day so let's go back to this idea of a big plastic box that we put little ice cubes in and at

[18:37] the time what I said was we had a little door on it we could put little these little ice cubes in there they would melt then they would evaporate and we'd have air with some certain kind of mixing ratio let's imagine we go back to this box and opened the door and I put in three more ice cubes and to close it and they melt and they evaporate and then I go back and open the door and I put three more ice cubes and they melt and they evaporate I could keep going back and I could keep putting ice cubes

[19:08] into the door but there comes a point where if I put too many in there they'll follow the bottom they'll melt but they will no longer evaporate because air has a limit as to how much water vapor can exist in it in any given time and so we have a term for this it's called saturation so what that means if we talk about the air is reached saturation or

[19:38] maybe we might say the air is saturated what that means is that the air can no longer hold any more water vapor so this is critical because what this means is that there's a limit is a limit as to how much water can be in the air at any given time now on learn or again if

[20:09] you're coming here from somewhere else on my website there is a graph that I want you now to look at so go ahead and download that and we're gonna look at this graph together it's a it's a table of numbers with a curve looks like this so this table on the left so the very left-hand column says air temperature and fahrenheit in this column here says maximum possible mixing ratio at this

[20:39] temperature so what it's showing is that if it let's say it's 70 degrees and we've got our plastic box idea right it's 70 degrees in one kilogram of air the absolute most water vapor that you could evaporate into one kilogram of bear is 19 point 12 grams so this is 19 point 12 grams per kilogram so in one box of air one kilogram box the this is the limit as to how much water that air

[21:11] could hold and you'll notice that as I increase the temperature the numbers get higher lower temperatures numbers get lower and in fact this graph is what you would get if you were to graph these numbers it would look like this we got temperature on the x-axis we've gotten maximum mixing ratio on the y-axis so what this is telling us this is actually one of the most fundamental laws in

[21:43] weather this idea that temperature controls how much water could be in the air at any given time what this is saying is that if you increase the temperature you the air could have more and more water vapor in it it doesn't mean it has to have that this is a maximum possible mixing ratio so let's say it's 80 degrees right so 80

[22:15] degrees the maximum I could have is 27 grams per kilogram could I have less than that yes how much less could I have zero sure I could have zero but I can't have more that's what this means notice as you go down into colder and colder temperatures the numbers get smaller and smaller or we get down into this graph let's say it's zero degrees Fahrenheit here zero right so at zero the maximum I could

[22:46] have is about a little over one gram per kilogram so even if the air saturated even if it's completely maxed out the most I could have is a little bit more than one gram per kilogram so this is critical because what this means is that cold air is always dry air even if it's saturated even if it's completely maxed out it's still dry I look down here

[23:18] temperature is a minus 20 minus 40 right or on this table you've got really tiny mixing ratios that are possible so one of the rules and weather and climate is we're going to get into is cold air always dry air always no there's no way around that however hot air could be humid it could have high mixing ratios but it doesn't have to all right so it could be very

[23:50] low or it could be very high but cold air absolutely has to be dry air no matter what all right so we can see the effects that temperature has on humidity if we look at the earth as a whole so I've gone to the site earth null Schoolnet and this is a visualization tool that shows us the current weather all over and I'm gonna click the word earth and I'm gonna pick an overlay it says tpw

[24:20] that's for total precipitable water and what this is going to show us is it's going to show us that the how much water is in the atmosphere mm-hmm and there's no numbers here but to the left on the scale the brown that's very very dry air and then as you get more humidity more water vapor it turns more blue than light blue and then kind of this white color I'm gonna click the word earth to make that disappear and so I can rotate

[24:52] the earth around and look at where most of the water vapor is on the planet and what I see is that there's this big band of really high humidity air that that's typically found around the equator so as you probably know it's usually pretty hot at the equator and it's sitting over this open body of warm water and because of that the mixing ratios there are usually very high on the other hand if I

[25:24] turn this around say we could look at Arctica and and Arctica is very dry because it is very cold right and so both of the poles of the earth are pretty cold but Antarctica is even more cold because not only is that the South Pole the South Pole is about a mile above sea level so it's much colder than North Pole and we see it's very Brown very dry air here but we can also see some other effects like if I go to let's

[25:55] go over here to South America and you'll see that there's this brown blob right here so I'll zoom in a little bit there so this is all the amazon basin here so think about tropical rainforest right so pretty humid here but what's this why is this so dry right here so that's a very tall mountain chain called the Andes and so high elevation is usually colder temperatures colder temperatures mean

[26:26] drier air so we've got well the really dry air here next to pretty humid air and we can see this in several other places in the world and again if you do this yourself you'll see slightly different patterns than I'm seen depending on what time of year you're looking it's winter in the northern hemisphere right now so we see a lot of dry air over the continents the cold air that's coming down from near the North Pole so look at someone closer

[26:56] to home here yeah we're all still pretty dry here so overall if you just kind of look at the earth as a whole you will see that we've got a band of pretty humid air around the equator and pretty dry on the north and south poles okay we're going to do a little thought experiment here so let's go back to this idea of having a box of air I got one kilogram of air and there's water molecules floating around inside the air

[27:29] in this box and I happen to know that the mixing ratio is nine point two four grams per kilogram okay I also happen to know that the temperature of the air in this box is 70 degrees so one question I could ask could I add more water molecules to the air inside the box so if I go to this table and I look at 70 degrees it says the maximum possible mixing ratio at 17 degrees is 19 point 12 I'm only at nine point two four so I

[28:03] could definitely add more water to the air inside this box okay but we're going to do something different actually we're gonna cool it down so let's imagine that I start to cool this box down so it's at 70 and I start to cool down to 65 to 60 to 55 and notice what happens on our list of numbers here as I go down from 72 65 to 60 to 55 the maximum possible

[28:35] mixing ratio is also going down right so if I get down to 50 while 50 the maximum possible mixing ratio is nine point two four grams per kilogram which is exactly what I have so if I cool this down from 70 to 50 when I get to 50 at that point the air is saturated it can't hold any more water vapor okay now let's say I cool it

[29:06] further so I'm gonna cool it all the way down to 45 let's say well the maximum possible mixing wish' at forty five is seven point six four grams per kilogram but I'm at nine point two four so as I cool it down to forty five I've got to lose about two and a half or so grams of water so as soon as I get down to 50 in the air becomes saturated as I COO it further water molecules have to come out

[29:39] of the vapor state out of the air and they will collect on the bottom or the size of this box so whether nature requires that all my little water molecules the extras have to come out and they will start to collect in these clusters on the inside of the box and the transition from the vapor state to these clusters of liquid

[30:11] we call that condensation right okay so condensation occurs at 50 degrees and as we cool it further and further and further we will continue to pull water out of the air as required by the numbers that are in this table so let me show this to you a slightly different way and imagine here I've got just an

[30:42] image of water molecules here floating around we don't know how many there are and it's 80 degrees outside right so I start to cool it say Sun Goes Down this is air outside Sun Goes Down starts to cool and cools and it cools and it cools and if it cools enough eventually we're gonna reach the saturation point and when we do when we reach that saturation point and then we continue to COO it further

[31:14] we would start making condensation so right here we've got the 65 degrees we're making condensation this is not rain this is water that's coming out as drops on the surface and at that point they are saturated and what we have just made is something called do right so these droplets and I have to show pictures of this to people that live in New Mexico because our air is so dry that this only happens a few times a

[31:45] year but when it does happen the dew droplets typically form on the grass and the reason is because the grass is very thin and thin things cool off first so these are do droplets that form one that when the air was cooled down to the point that saturation occurs and cooled even further below that so if we go back to this idea this temperature at which

[32:15] this happened in our box this has a name this is called the dew point temperature or sometimes because we're lazy we just call it the dew point so you've actually done this experiment yourself you've taken at some point probably leftovers

[32:46] leftover food you put it in the Tupperware you put the Tupperware in the refrigerator and you come back the next day and you pull it out and when you take the lid off you'll notice there's a bunch of little drops on the inside of the lid that weren't there when you put the food in the refrigerator so what happened there is you when you put it into the refrigerator the air that was in that container had a higher mixing ratio than it was allowed by the temperature of the refrigerator

[33:16] so you actually may do in that box in the refrigerator now if we go back to this case this example here here because our we notice the condensation occurred at 65 degrees on this particular night we could conclude from that that the dew point temperature was 65 that's when we still saw condensation first start to

[33:46] form now let's say I do this another night and I've got less water vapor to start with right so there's less water molecules in the air than there was in this first example it's 80 degrees again and I cool it down and I cool it down the last time we hit the dew point here but we've got less water now so that means I can cool it further before I actually reach saturation so in this case I cool it all the way down the 50 degrees until I

[34:16] finally see that the water molecules start to condensate out as do so from here what we could can conclude is that the dew point is 50 degrees because that's when condensation occurs so mixing ratio is one way that humidity is reported the other way is dew point so in a weather report they'll often give the dew point as a way to represent the

[34:46] humidity in the way that works low dew point means there's less water vapor in the air which means the air is pretty dry high dew point means there's more water vapor in the air which means that air has is more generally more humid so the other way to think about dew point is that it describes the temperature at which the atmosphere becomes saturated so if I tell you let's say tonight I say we check the weather and the weather report says the dew point is 45 degrees

[35:18] one of the bits of information that tells us is that if we cool it down the 45 tonight we will get do right we'll we'll get saturation so here's an example of how we might use dewpoint so this is a map and this map has temperatures of dew points in degrees Fahrenheit and you can see that over here in the southeast they've got dew points that are in the 60s and 70s over here in our neck of the woods we have dew points that are in the 20s so that tells you there's a lot more

[35:51] water vapor in the air over here then there is where we live another way to think about this so if you lived say in Florida if it got down to the 60s at night you would get do right because the dew point here is like 65 here it's 70 if you lived over here you'd have to have temperatures down below 25 if you're in the red zone or below 20 if you're in the yellow zone by the way

[36:23] what happens when you get dew points below freezing if the dew point is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit or zero degrees centigrade then that means that in order to get do you've got to get it below freezing but you're not going to get liquid what you'll get is frost and frost looks the same it's little sparkles on the grass at night that's when the dew point is below freezing and you manage to cool it below freezing but it's the same idea and in the winter this is a lot more

[36:53] common you may have scraped ice off your windshield that's what's happening it's you've reached saturation but the saturation point was below freezing and your windshield is thin you know cools off first another way that we actually use dew point a lot in New Mexico is to monitor the monsoon and we'll talk about the monsoon in later lectures but this is something called the dew point tracker and so if you look at this on

[37:23] the x-axis these are dates there's June first and then there's July 1st and the ignore everything except the blue line for the blue line is the dew point as recorded at the airport here in Albuquerque so when the blue numbers are higher you have more water vapor in the air you have higher dew points then you'll see them drop that's low dew points dew dew points are over here on

[37:53] the on the y axis so here we got dew points of like maybe five degrees Fahrenheit they don't have units but these are units of Fahrenheit so we had really dry air right through here then it got more humid then they got a little bit drier then they got more humid again and goes back and forth back and forth but notice that once we get into July we have pretty high dew points for almost the entire summer now this graph stops in August 22nd which is when they made this one look

[38:24] for a minute at the red curve the red curve is what you get if you were to average out all of the monsoons that have happened in the past 30 years and if you do so on average in Albuquerque what happens is the dew point starts to rise in the spring and once it rises past this Green Line this Green Line is 47 degrees it rises past this this Green

[38:54] Line for three consecutive days we declare that the monsoon has officially started and then on average again we're looking at the red one on average the red line stays above this green line and it starts to dip back below the Green Line in the middle of September and then we go into the fall so dew point is one of the things that we use to monitor the monsoon activity when we have high dew points that's usually coincides with

[39:24] what we call monsoon bursts we have a lot of there's a lot of humidity in the air a lot of water in the air and so that's more conducive to precipitation formation so when you see these spikes here those are times when we probably had more thunderstorms and more chances of precipitation or sometimes we go into what are called monsoon breaks and that's what this is so this dip here is a period where we were in a very dry spell ative ly dry air for the monsoon period and during

[39:56] that time we probably saw very few of any cumulonimbus very few thunderstorms during that time so dew point is pretty important here in New Mexico especially during the monsoon season so dew point is reported at pretty much all weather stations report dew point it changes throughout the year so in New Mexico it's typically higher in the summer and lower in the winter and one of the other

[40:27] things that can change dew point especially where we live is the wind direction so we happen to live between you know New Mexico's here and we've got a pretty warm body of water down here and we have a pretty cold body of water over here right so let's say we've got wind coming from the northwest where did that wind come from well it came from somewhere to the north where was probably cold and cold air is always dry

[40:58] air dry air low dew point so we have wind's coming out of the West or the north of the Northwest usually that coincides with times of low dew point on the other hand if the wind comes out of the east or the southeast that's coming from a location that was pretty warm big warm body of water that's usually conducive to high amounts of water vapor in the air so usually for us if we have wind that comes out of the East or the

[41:29] southeast we usually get higher dew points because we have more water in the air you
