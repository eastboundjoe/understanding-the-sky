[0:02] [Music] hey this is Mel strong and this is a little extra help for people who are still struggling to understand the difference between dew point and relative humidity and how they're related so I'm gonna use this little interactive tool from the University of Wisconsin so I've put a link up on learn and on my website so you can play with this too and so over on the right hand

[0:32] side here cuz we're gonna ignore the left for now on the right hand side we've got a thermometer and we've got dew point and we've got relative humidity and as I I can make changes in either the temperature of the dew point and it will show me how that changes relative humidity now when we did this in my previous lecture if you watch my lecture on relative humidity we calculated it with mixing ratios now we could have also done it with dew points remember both mixing ratio and dew point

[1:02] tell you how much water is in the air they're just two different ways of reporting the same thing but it's the calculation to get the relative humidity is much more difficult if you only have dew point so this doesn't have mixing ratio in it but it's the same concept so right now the temperature is a little bit above sixty degrees the dew point looks like it's a little below 40 and our relative humidity is 38 percent okay so if I raise the temperature so I just

[1:34] drag this up you notice what's happening to the relative humidity as that temperature goes up the relative humidity goes down so to relate this to what we've done before with mixing ratios we said the top of the fraction was the current mixing ratio that's not changing because dew point is not changing remember dew point mixing really shall have to change together if I add more water to the air they both go up if I subtract bar from the air they both go down the fact that dew point is not changing tells me that the amount of

[2:04] water in the air is still a constant but I mean I increased the temperature just then so again to relate that to what we've seen before I'm dividing by the maximum possible mixing ratio and the maximum possible mixing ratio goes up as temperature goes up dividing by a bigger number gets me a smaller answer so as I raise the temperature you saw the relative humidity decreased so I will continue the race if the temperature

[2:35] will make as hot as we can make it relative humidity goes down the five percent okay so watch what happens when I cool it down so I'm going to cool down the temperature so I cool it down and I cool it down and notice the relative humidity is increasing the dew points not changing because I'm not taking water from the air okay so I'm going to tropic further cool it cool it and notice that the relative humidity continues to go higher and higher and so now as I as I'm getting closer and closer to the dew point the dew points a

[3:05] little below 40 I'm getting I'm getting close notice how high my relative humidity is so I'm gonna drop it even further dropped out okay so now relative humidity is a hundred percent temperature and dew point are the same okay so I'm going to continue to cool it further so we would be making do at this point even though the picture shows snow that's not quite correct because we're above freezing but we would be making do okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna lower the

[3:35] temperature so as I lower the temperature notice what happens to the dew point the dew point has to go down with it but the relative humidity stays at exactly 100% right so I can now we're below freezing for sure we're making Frost but I'll keep going down and keep going down and as long as I keep making it colder and colder the dew point has to go lower and lower because I'm taking water out of the air and putting it onto the ground at first it was liquid and then it's

[4:05] frozen but that entire time the relative humidity was staying at 100% so now let's say I warm it up so now the dew point is really low the dew point looks like it's about negative 10 and as I warm the temperature up you see the relative humidity rapidly drop now this is not completely realistic because normally what happens if you if we may do in the more overnight and the

[4:36] do sitting on the grass then when the Sun comes up the next day that do evaporates back into the air at least most of it does and the dew point would go back up what this is doing is once we lowered the dew point it's keeping it lowered right so that's a not quite what happens in nature usually so here's another thing I could do so let me crank up the temperature to sixty relative humidity is four percent if I add water to the air I increase dew point right so

[5:06] I can crank up the dew point as I cranked up the dew point relative humidity is also increasing now in this case it's increasing because we think again back to the definition of relative humidity that we used with with mixing ratios the top part of that fraction was the the current mixing ratio how do you increase the current mixing ratio you add more water to the air you add more grams of water to the air increasing dew point is the same thing if I add water to the air dew point goes up so we don't

[5:39] see a process here you have to imagine there's someone off the screen that's adding water to the air somehow as I crank this up so there's some mechanism that we can't see that as I crank this up I'm adding do I'm adding water vapor to the air and the dew point consequently is going up the temperature is the same but as I add water relative humidity goes up with it so go up and up and up and up and then when I get up to about there I am 100% relative humidity temperature

[6:10] and dew point are the same if I it is physically impossible for me to have dew point above temperature so the way this software handles this is if I try to crank dew point higher it also just raises the temperature so that you don't have math that makes no sense but in reality if I was actually adding water to the air the temperature does not magically go up okay that's kind of a limitation of this of this software simulation so here two

[6:40] temperature eighty degrees dew point eighty degrees relative for me 100% this would be a pretty miserable place to live right now if you had this because you as we talked about with the evaporation lecture your sweat would not evaporate so from here if I cool it down I'm generating a condensation making do making do a relative humidity again stays of 100% then I can raise the temperature back up and again the

[7:10] dewpoint stays there because we have no mechanism to add or subtract water from the air so this is a little tool that you can play with maybe it'll help on the left hand side there is another thing where what they're doing is they've got an indoor thermometers and so both of these things are outdoor there's an indoor thermometer and then indoor relative humidity and you can do things like you can change the temperature you can turn the air conditioner on and off and you can see what the effect is on the indoor

[7:42] relative humidity so you can play with that if you want you can open the door and let in some outside air and see how that changes the the point being that often we have the same air outside as we have inside right it's usually the same air and if I have a relative humidity gauge inside it'll have one reading on it and I have a relative gate relative humidity gauge outside it'll have a different reading on it but the air is the same why are the readings different

[8:13] because the temperatures are different that's why and that's what plane with this allows you to allows you to mess with that okay so I don't know if that helps it up but you can go and play with this to your heart's content and see if you can understand the relationship between dewpoint temperature relative humidity
