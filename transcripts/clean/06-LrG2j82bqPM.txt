[0:06] hey I'm Mel strong and this is a lecture on cloud formation and convection in the atmosphere if you haven't watched the lectures on humidity first go back and do that because we're gonna be talking about dewpoint and relative humidity here so to recap what we've been saying so far is if you take a body air and you cool it down to its dew point you will hit saturation and as you cool it further air molecules will come out of the vapor State and form drops of liquid on the surfaces that cool first and the

[0:37] surfaces that cool first are the thinnest ones which are usually grass now the same exact process is happening up in the sky when we see a cloud when you see a cloud all that really is is a blob of air that has been cooled down to its dew point so the same process happens the air becomes saturated as it gets cooled further water molecules must leave the vapor state and enter the liquid state and what's different is that on the ground this happens on a

[1:09] surface like grass so what's the surface up here well there are these little microscopic particles in the atmosphere you might know them as dust or smoke or soot or this tiny little salt crystals where the ocean waves hit each other out in the ocean and make sea spray the sea spray evaporates and makes tiny little salt crystals that fly through the atmosphere they find them all over above the continents they're all over the place and we call these things condensation nuclei because they're

[1:40] going to form the surfaces when water molecules come together so here's an illustration of the sizes of the things we're talking about here so here we have a human here for scale and first thing to point out is that the cloud droplets the little spheres of water that are in clouds are actually themselves microscopic so a raindrop might be this size we're not making raindrops here we're making cloud drops in the next

[2:10] lecture we'll talk about how to get this but for now we're talking about how to get this these to get these two different size cloud droplets water vapor must form on a surface and the surface it finds are these condensation nuclei these these tiny little specks that are in this diagram here so we can look at some of these under scanning electron microscope and dust can main all kinds of things usually there are fragments of rock though and so water molecules when saturation occurs they

[2:41] will start to condense on the surface of this dust particle or it might be pollen has a lot of surface area and so the the Centers of little cloud droplets are often pollen grains or even bacteria so there's bacteria in the atmosphere flying around and water molecules will collect on the bacteria some of these are actually made by humans so this is fly ash and these these little spheres of carbon and they're made when you burn

[3:11] coal and so coal power plants in this country remove most of that but a lot of it still gets into the atmosphere and water molecules will collect on the surfaces of these little spheres so all of these things are examples of what condensation nuclei look like so anytime you see a cloud it's just air that's been cooled to below its dew point and as humans we can make clouds pretty easily by just adding water vapor to air that's already cold so we do this for

[3:41] example on a cold morning so this person is exhaling in the cold air and you can quote-unquote see her breath which just means that her breath has been cooled to below its dew point so for example maybe the temperature outside is 40 and the dew point outside is 10 so we have relatively dry air well think about the air that's in her lungs right so your lungs are warm and they're moist and the air that you breathe in picks up a lot of water vapor from your lungs and maybe the air that's coming out of your

[4:12] mouth has a dew point of 60 or maybe it's higher than 60 and the temperature of your breath won't quite be body temperature but it's gonna be pretty warm and so you breathe out this air that's pretty warm and as a dew point of 61 if the dewpoints 60 all we have to do is cool it down to 60 and we'd start to make a cloud well it's temperature outside is 40 so as she breathes out this air with dew point of 60 is it cools down to 40 then that water vapor that's in her breath

[4:43] has to come out and form little tiny liquid droplets and we see a cloud now you might notice that on some days you can see your breath but it doesn't last long like it's just an instant and then goes away in other days you can see your breath and it seems to linger for a while so let's change this a little bit and let's say that the day is the same temperature but the dew point is instead of 10 is now 39 so notice that the dew point is pretty close to the temperature

[5:13] if they were the same relative humidity is 100% they're not quite the same but they're close so what we can say without doing any math is that the relative humidity is pretty high with these conditions dew points almost the same as temperature on a day where the relative humidity is really high your breath will linger in the air longer because remember relative humidity is related to evaporation if I have low relative humidity I have a high rate of evaporation so in the first example when

[5:45] the dew point was 10 her breath might not last very long at all because the evaporation rate is so great that those little droplets are quickly evaporating in this case because the relative humidity is high her breath will linger in the air much longer so if you see you know you have a morning where you can see a big cloud around people when they're breathing and it seems to linger in the air one of the things you can learn from that is that the relative humidity must be pretty high on that particular day also and this is harder

[6:16] to see but this one picture kind of shows it there will be a gap between the person's mouth and when the cloud forms and the reason for that is the air that's coming out of their mouth is pretty close to their body temperature and you've got to cool it down to the dew point and it takes a little while for that to happen so there'll be a little space here where there's no cloud until you finally hit the dew point right there and then the heirs continued to cool further now there's another way that we add water to the atmosphere and that's

[6:46] the burning fuel so hydrocarbons are a class of molecules and they get their name because they have carbon and hydrogen in them and they're pretty much all flammable and we as humans burn them so the simplest possible one is a gas called methane also known as swamp gas if you can't tell that's a small and methane is flammable and if I light it on fire it reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere and it produces co2 that goes back into the atmosphere and it also

[7:16] produces water vapor that goes into the atmosphere or if I take a slightly more complicated hydrocarbon propane so it's more complicated because it's got more carbons in it so c3h8 propane as is the gas you might use in your barbecue but when you burn it you react it with oxygen in the atmosphere which then adds co2 back to the atmosphere and also adds water vapor to the atmosphere or it can get more complicated and get a molecule called butane butane as c4h10 this is

[7:47] what they put in lighters you react it with oxygen produces co2 and produces water so on each one of these examples as we burn this fossil fuel we're adding water to the atmosphere more and more complicated hard hydrocarbons not only become more complicated molecules but you can get mixtures of things so for example gasoline is a mixture of different kinds of hydrocarbons coal is a mixture of different kinds of hydrocarbons so one example of this is

[8:18] when you start your car on a cold morning and you see this bit well it looks like a big white cloud coming out of your tailpipe in fact is a cloud it's water that's coming from the burning of hydrocarbons so there's water vapor coming out of your exhaust pipe it gets cooled to the dew point and condensation occurs and the other thing you might notice on a cold morning when you're sitting in traffic and you're behind somebody else is you'll see water actually dripping out of the tailpipe and that's water that's from burning of hydrocarbons burning the gasoline it

[8:50] reaches the dew point somewhere inside the tailpipe because it hasn't warmed up enough yet and drips out and you can see it running out of the tailpipe another example is if you see a coal-fired power plant so this is one this is the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona and so the burning coal and on the cold morning you will see a big plume of white coming out of the smokestacks and that's all water as you burn coal it produces water like

[9:20] we've been saying the water vapor comes up into the atmosphere chills of the dew point and you're making a cloud in the cloud eventually evaporates another example is with planes and a plane will often leave what's called a condensation trail so this plane this jet engines got four of them each jet engine is burning hydrocarbons and as a result is producing water water vapor comes out and at first it's hot and you see

[9:50] there's no cloud right here there's a gap and then eventually it gets cooled to it's dew point and you get a cloud and there's four clouds for the four engines so condensation trails whether you might notice that some days condensation trails are very obvious and they stay up in the sky a long time in some days if you look carefully there are planes that actually don't have any condensation trails at all or they're very short and that's all dependent on what the relative humidity up here is

[10:20] the higher the relative humidity the the easier it is for a jet to make a condensation trail so here's some condensation trails and on this day it looks like the relative humidity is pretty high because one of the things that can happen is that condensation trail can actually start to nucleate into clouds so this one is starting to turn into cirrocumulus right this one's starting to turn into cirrocumulus down here looks like some of these are starting to turn into cirrus so remember

[10:50] clouds really high clouds are typically all ice crystals and so one of the things that condensation trails from jets can do is they can basically make artificial clouds they'll make a little band tiny narrow bands of Cirrus or tiny bands of cirrocumulus here's a very interesting satellite photo taken one morning where the relative humidity was pretty high on that morning and you see all these streaks all these little white streaks all over those are all condensation trails from jets so what we're working

[11:24] up towards is we've got some little puffy clouds here and what we want to do is understand why is it that this cloud forms right there and ends right there and why is there cloud here and not a cloud there that's what we're working up towards but what we're going to do first is get into a little bit about properties of error so we're going to spend a couple minutes looking at the properties of air and I've got a

[11:54] simulation from Phet called gas properties and what I've got is a big empty box here where all of the air has been removed from the box we just have two gas molecules so this might be say nitrogen and oxygen would you've got one of each and what I want you to notice is that notice the behavior of of these air molecules inside this box they move in a perfectly straight line until they hit something and then they reflect off so

[12:25] if we can imagine taking all the air out of a room and when we release say two molecules and oxygen and nitrogen what we would notice is that they were flying out in at room temperature perhaps a couple hundred miles an hour if they go flying out and start bouncing off the walls and the objects in the room now realistically of course there is way more than just two air molecules so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna add a bunch more molecules to this box so

[12:56] I'm gonna add some small ones and then add some big ones and what I want you to notice is that in addition to bouncing off the walls they're actually more bouncing off each other now and this is more realistic to how air actually works if I had one individual oxygen one Vigil nitrogen even though it wants to move in a perfectly straight line till hit something what it actually does is it moves in a perfectly straight line

[13:27] until it hits one of its neighbors and then reflects off its neighbor and then it moves in a perfectly straight line again until hits another neighbor and as it's moving these little straight lines it might be going several hundred miles an hour and each one of these other movements but over time it takes a really long time for it to actually get across the room because it has to balance against all of its neighbors but that's how to imagine air that's how to imagine how air behaves imagine a room full of ping-pong balls just flying around the room bouncing into everything

[13:58] okay so now imagine that you are this little guy here and you are pushing this is a wall that can move slides back and forth okay and he's got to push on that wall because these air molecules on the other side are pushing back at him right and so for every square inch of surface every object everywhere on earth there are air molecules that are coming down and hitting that that object so on this

[14:30] you can see them they're bouncing up you know bouncing against the wall several times a second in real life maybe they may be hitting every surface millions of times a second and that produces a pressure and that pressure is will be called air pressure so in this particular simulation there's a gauge here of air pressure and then using a unit it says ATM and that's called atmospheres so in this little simulation one atmosphere just to put in perspective is how much air pressure you would feel at sea level on earth okay so

[15:02] it doesn't really matter the exact numbers or anything doesn't matter and the temperature in this case is Kelvin and again the exact number doesn't matter what matters is we're going to make a few adjustments I want you to look at how these two things change so our little guy here can push against this wall so I'm gonna make I'm gonna push the wall in and make the Box smaller and so I what I want you to do is keep an eye on those two things so here we go so I'm gonna push and as I push notice what the temperature is

[15:32] doing and notice what the pressure is doing okay so the pressure has gone up and the temperature has gone up and also the air molecules are moving much faster than they were before and we've said this in earlier lecture that temperature is a measure of the average speed of a gas so in the atmosphere if as we make it warmer all objects start to move faster so I'm going to make open up the box and notice

[16:02] the pressure goes down temperature goes down and the molecules are going slower and slower and slower okay so this is one of the big properties of gases if I have a closed box or think maybe more like a balloon of air and I compress this air right if I compress the air the air gets warmer and the pressure goes up and if I expand my box or expand my

[16:32] balloon then the pressure goes down and the temperature goes down so there's one more thing I can demonstrate here and so far the behavior of the gases in this box is what you would get if there was no gravity and what this simulation allows you to do is add gravity so what I want you to do is imagine that this box now represents the Earth's atmosphere okay so this entire box is all of the air in the Earth's atmosphere

[17:03] and Earth is down here and what I'm going to do is turn on gravity and I want you to watch what happens to the air molecules in this box so here we go now notice first thing you can notice is that the denser blue gas molecules are concentrated towards the bottom but actually and it's hard to see this with the red but all the gases are actually

[17:34] concentrated more towards the bottom so this is the way to visualize air in the Earth's atmosphere because earth has gravity gravity is trying to pull all the gas down to the surface and the only reason that all the gases aren't just laying on the ground is because they have enough kinetic energy that they balance against each other and continue to stay in the atmosphere if earth earth had a stronger gravitational field it would be able to compress the

[18:04] gas closer to the surface so what this means is if you were to say get into a balloon anywhere to rise up into Earth's atmosphere there would be fewer and fewer gas molecules banging against the surface of the balloon because most of the gas is concentrated near the surface near the ground and so on earth what we know is that air pressure is highest at sea level and as you go up and up and up as humans it gets harder and harder to breathe right so in Albuquerque were

[18:35] mile above sea level a mile above us here are about the top of Sandia Crest and up there you know a lot of people have trouble breathing by the time you get up to say Mount Everest you're 30,000 feet almost nobody can breathe and so air pressure decreases with height decreases with height above the ground and this is why because Earth's gravity is trying to pull the gas down towards the surface so when we talk

[19:05] about things convecting in the atmosphere we use this term called air parcel and an air parcel is just a blob of air you can't see it but when you hear that term just think of a balloon so here I've just got a normal little balloon and as we just learned air pressure you think air pressure is being the result of all those little air molecules banging against the side of any surface including the outside of this balloon now there's also air on the

[19:36] inside of the balloon and there's air pressure on the inside and that molecules on the inside of the balloon are also banging on the sides trying to get out and it turns out those two forces are balanced so my balloon does not change size right so this the force is pushing in and the force is pushing out from from inside are exactly balanced when we talk about air parcels in the atmosphere moving up and down I want you to visualize a balloon just like this that's moving up and down so I'm gonna

[20:08] put this balloon in this little chamber here and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start pumping the air molecules out from inside this chamber so in other words the amount of air in the balloon itself is not going to change the air around the balloon is going to change and this is going to simulate what happens when a balloon or a parcel of air rises up into the atmosphere as it rises up into the atmosphere there's less and less air molecules up there

[20:39] that are banging on the sides of our little balloon so they'll be so there's less pressure up there so this is going to simulate that I'm going to pump air out of this chamber so this will look tube you can't see if there's a pump off the screen here so I want you to just imagine there's air being sucked down this tube and we'll see what the balloon does so that again this is a simulation of what would happen to air parcel as it goes up into the atmosphere

[21:13] okay so we are now pumping air out of this balloon and I think you can see that's getting ordered and I'll step out of the way here it's okay so I'm going to turn off the

[21:45] pump so I don't think I need to convince you that the balloon got bigger so this is what you have to keep in mind which I want you to imagine when we talk about air parcels rising into the atmosphere as they rise into the atmosphere there's less air banging on the outside of the sides of this balloon or the size of an air parcel and the air parcel will expand so anytime air rises from the earth up up into the atmosphere it

[22:15] expands and it gets larger now one of the see what I'm going to do here is I am now going to let air back in and so we're gonna see so we would expect that the moon should get smaller so let's see if that's what happens now in a face-to-face class or what I do at this point is I pull this out and hand it to somebody in the class and I ask them tell me how it feels and they grab

[22:48] it and they're like oh it's really warm in fact the moon is pretty hot right now and the reason for that is because I just took a balloon that was the size of this and shrunk it down to the size of this and as we saw in the earlier segment when you compress air it gets warmer the opposite is also true if you expand air it gets cooler so even though I can't really demonstrate it to you here when we expanded that balloon up to

[23:18] the size of the of this whole chamber it was the air inside there was actually cooler so put those two ideas together if I have a parcel of air and it rises into the atmosphere okay two things happen it expands and because of expands it cools on the other hand if I have a parcel there and I'm bringing it down it gets smaller and it gets warmer okay so we keep those two laws in mind

[23:50] so not only do we know that rising air expands and cools in sinking air compresses and worms but we can predict exactly how much the temperature will change turns out doesn't matter where you are in the atmosphere rising air will always cool at a rate of five point four degrees for every thousand feet that it rises or it will warm five point four degrees for every thousand feet that it sinks or in the metric system the temperatures will change 9.8 degrees

[24:20] Celsius for every one kilometer these numbers are known as the lapse rates and this particular number is called the dry adiabatic lapse rate and dry means that the relative humidity is less than 100% meaning you're not in a cloud so these numbers are valid for air moving up and down the atmosphere as long as it's not in a cloud adiabatic is a little bit more hard to understand but if this is my air parcel as it rises up or down in

[24:51] the atmosphere remember it can change his temperature it's going to expand or it's going to compress and the temperature is going to change adiabatic means it's not absorbing any extra heat from its neighbors or it's not emitting any heat to to its neighbors in other words 80 Bennett kind of means it's insulated so we're talking about these air parcels moving up and down the atmosphere and we're going to pretend that they're perfectly insulated from their environment that's what we mean by adiabatic okay so for this next part I'm

[25:21] going to use a handout that I have put up on learn from my current students and if you're from somewhere else on the internet it's on my web page and you might want to print this out so you can kind of follow along with what we're going to do it's two-sided and we're going to start with day one so the premise of this is that we've got a mountain up here in the atmosphere and we've sent a weather balloon up and the weather balloon has measured the temperatures every thousand feet so we know that the conditions of the air

[25:52] above our heads now we'll talk more about this in a future lecture but when you have a mountain that's sticking up in the atmosphere the surface of the mountain will warm faster than the air okay so we've got three locations here where we know the conditions at the surface the temperatures and the dew point of the air at the surface of the mountain and the question is will the air at those three locations rise and if it does rise

[26:22] will it eventually form a cloud so what I'm gonna do here is start with the one on the right and get a calculator so here we know that the the temperature is 85 degrees the dew point is 55 degrees and the question is is this air going to rise and I check the conditions of the air right next to it which is 84 85 is

[26:55] greater than 84 and air wants to rise now you've heard the term warm air rises that is true sort of if I have a blanket a continuous blanket of warm air it will not rise because any parcel within that blanket is the same temperature as its surrounding neighbors and it doesn't rise but if I have a little plume of warm air that's warmer than the air around it then it does want to rise okay so in this case 85 warmer than 84 it's

[27:26] going to rise so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna draw some arrows to represent this air rising okay now question is when it gets a thousand feet above the ground so as it rise as it rises it expands and it cools what is its temperature up here well from the dry adiabatic lapse rate I know it's going to cool five point four degrees Fahrenheit for every thousand feet and in these exercises we're sticking with Fahrenheit and feet because America that's why so I'm going

[27:58] to take 85 and I'm going to subtract five point four and i get seventy nine point six i'm gonna draw it right on the line because this line the temperature right on that line is 78 so i compare is this warmer than 78 yes it is so continue rising so then I draw more arrows and I want to know okay what would its temperature be if it got up to this height second let's subtract another five point four and I get

[28:28] seventy four point two and I look and I compare is it still going to rise seventy four point two warmer than seventy two yes so it's going to continue to rise as subtract another five point four and I get the sixty eight point eight now warmer than the air around it here warmer than the air around it here but here sixty eight point eight is cooler than seventy so what we know is that our parcel of air

[28:59] will rise and expand and cool and rise and expand and cool but stays warmer than the air around it until it gets to this point that means somewhere between here and here our rising air stops so we don't know exactly where so in this class for convention let's just draw in the middle so in the middle this close this air right turns and starts to sink back down like this so it doesn't get

[29:30] this high right we know what passes this point doesn't get to this point stop somewhere in the middle this loop that we made is called a convection current a or convection cell and it goes has another popular name called a thermal and thermals are outside right now every day as long as the Sun is up so what happens is the Sun comes up in the morning and the surface starts to warm

[30:01] and depending on what the surface is made out of it warms to slightly different temperatures and little poems the warm air start to rise you can't ever see it but it's happening every day now what will happen is early in the morning the the thermals rise maybe just a few feet and then they sink back down by late afternoon they may go up several miles before they come back down now birds know all about this and a big bird with a big wingspan it

[30:32] takes a lot of energy for it to flap its wings for active flight so what they'll do is they will figure out where there's a thermals right now we got this big guy up here and he has found a plume of rising warm air and so hit what he has to do is if he stays within this plume of warm air he doesn't have to flap his wings because he can just kind of ride use that rising air his lifts and he can stay up as long as he wants now one thing that the bird has to take into

[31:03] account though is in this case and the one that we drew he can fly in here no problem but the problem is for him is that if he gets out here he's gonna get sucked down this arm of the thermal and of course he has a bird brain so he doesn't know this so if you watch these big birds but what will happen is that they'll be flying around and flying around and then they accidentally fly into this part and suddenly you'll see them discovery suddenly dive and it looks like they're diving down I click

[31:33] on the crashing of the ground but then they'll figure out how to get back into the thermal ok so let's do the next one and the next one surface is 76 temperature up there 72 and the question is is it going to rise 76 one with a 72 so yes it does so I'm going to draw some arrows and the question is now okay what's the temperature a thousand feet above the ground I take 76 and I subtract 5 point 4 and I

[32:04] get 70 point 6 is that warmer than the air that's up there so the number I'm checking with is this one that's what the weather blew and has measured yes it's warmer just barely so let's do it again another thousand feet subtracted another five point four and I get sixty five point two warmer yes it is keep going fifty nine point eight warmer keep going some drawing arrows this whole

[32:35] time to show that the air is rising subtract another five point four I get fifty four point four still warmer yes it is do it again subtract another 5.4 49 now at this point 49 is warmer than 48 so we know it's going to rise but there's something else that's going to happen because it turns out the dew point was 49 so our

[33:09] little air parcel that has been rising and rising has finally cooled until it hits the dew point so right here temperature is now equal to the dew point and what's the relative humidity conditions when that happens relative humidity is a hundred percent right there and we get condensation starting at this point and we're gonna start

[33:39] building a cloud okay now before we go to the next step realize now there's actually another thing that's going on and we talked about this in a previous lecture where we said that when you hit the dew point and you start making do that the water molecules not only collect into liquid droplets but they bring in these little boxes of thermal energy and they release them we call that latent heat and the formation of do

[34:10] we say that the time helps actually keep the grass warm when it occurs well we're now doing the same process but we're doing it up in the sky and we're doing it around those condensation nuclei so as our water molecules are coming in to grow a little cloud droplet they're adding thermal energy to the cloud okay so there's two competing processes then as this air wants to rise it's going to expand and cool right that's process

[34:41] number one process number two is as we condense water the water is adding latent heat back to the air so so number one cools it number two warms it who wins well the air-cooling still wins but what it means is that our lapse rate is now different instead of five point four degrees every thousand feet it's two point seven and it's actually varies on a bunch of things but in this class we're just gonna use the number of two point seven

[35:12] and so this number two point seven has a couple of different names sometimes the wet adiabatic lapse rate or the saturated lady abetik lapse rate or the moist adiabatic lapse rate but all three of these mean that relative humidity is a hundred percent and you have a cloud okay so just to recap it's rising and expanding which is cooling but the latent heat that's being added is warming so the net result is it's still cooling but not cooling as much as it was before

[35:42] okay so let's return to our cloud here so from now on because I'm inside a cloud I'm going to subtract two point seven instead of five point four so 49 minus two point seven is forty six point three okay is it warmer than the surrounding air yes just a little bit so I'm gonna draw my arrows to show the air rising inside the cloud because that's what happens so we're gonna go up another thousand feet subtract another

[36:13] two point seven I get forty three point six so my cloud is growing and we're making a little chemo form cloud like maybe a cumulus okay forty three point six warmer than forty three so I keep going and I try another thousand feet so I subtract another two point seven forty point nine okay forty point nine is cold in the forty to forty

[36:43] three point six is warmer than forty three so we know that it gets past this line but does not get to this line so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna draw my cloud kind of like this I know I'm trying to show that it gets somewhere between those two I'm just going to draw it halfway well where does the air go where the air exits out the top of the cloud and it goes back down Hey so our convection cell is the same

[37:14] thing as the thermal it's just that this one cooled enough that it reached the dew point and so it started to build a cloud and so what we're doing is we're just testing every thousand feet and we can figure out we know where the bottom of the cloud is and we know where the top of the cloud is the other thing this means is that you actively have to have air moving into a cloud to keep that cloud alive I'll talk more about that in a little bit so on this worksheet there

[37:46] are three points on the on the front on day one and then on the back there are three more points for day two so I'm going to stop right now with this and I'm gonna make a separate video where I work out all of the points on both day and one day one in two if you're having trouble understanding what's happening here okay so let's return to the initial question which is why do we have clouds in certain locations and not others why

[38:18] is the bottom of this cloud here why is the top of this cloud here so we can answer some of these questions now and if I look at on this landscape I can see that there's different elevations and there's different types of vegetation so we've got bushes and trees and grass and whatnot and so as the Sun comes out it warms this all these different materials to slightly different temperatures and the locations that are warmer are sending up thermals sending up plumes of warm air and some of those plumes of warm air sink back down without making a cloud

[38:48] but everywhere where you see a cloud you have to imagine that there's a plume of warm air that has risen up to a certain point where the temperature is equal to dew point and then from that point forward you will have made a cloud and it continues to rise inside the cloud if we annotate the whole thing here so air is heated at the surface rising air expands expanding air cools it's the dew point air saturated you have a hundred

[39:18] percent relative humidity air continues to rise inside the cloud until it is no longer warmer than the air around it exits out the cloud sinks back down okay so that's happening under each one of these little cumulus clouds now there's a couple of words to describe these conditions if we say we have stable air what that means is that if I try to make air rise it sinks back down to its initial position also if I push air down it wants to pop back up to its

[39:48] initial position if you have stable air and this is a term you'll hear and maybe in a weather report sometime if you have stable air that means that the skies will probably be cloudless or you might have some little tiny cumulus clouds the opposite of that is unstable air so if we have unstable air in the weather report what that means is that if the air rises it's going to continue to rise which means it will probably likely hit the dew point and make a cloud so when we have days of unstable air we often

[40:19] get talked humorous clause or cumulonimbus clouds and we'll talk more about this in the next lecture so to summarize what we've done today a cloud is just air that has been cooled to the dew point so if it happens at the surface we get dew on the grass if it happens up in the sky we get a cloud the surface is that the water molecules collect - are called condensation nuclei mostly just dust the gravity of the earth wants to hold all the air to the surface but it can't so what happens is

[40:50] it holds most of the air towards the surface which means that the air pressure is greater towards the surface and decreases as you go up so therefore if you have a air parcel and it goes up it feels less and less air pressure it expands expanding air cools every day when the Sun comes out you get these rising booms of warm air that are rising expanding and cooling and if they go high enough they may cool to the dew point and that will get you cumuliform clouds so in the next lecture we'll talk

[41:20] about what happens if this process continues and the clouds continue to grow I'm no strong thanks for watching you
