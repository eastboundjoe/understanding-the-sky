[0:00] so in this video we're going to continue looking at the worksheet that we started in the lecture on convection and so I did two locations in the lecture we did this one here and this turns out to be a little thermal with no cloud then we did this one which turns out to have a cloud that starts at 8,000 feet and stop somewhere between ten and eleven thousand feet and so what I'm gonna do next is this one over here so I'll look at the temperature 64 I

[0:30] compare it to the air that's already up there which is 53 so first thing to keep in mind remember what we're comparing this to what's the temperature of the air already up there don't confuse yourself with these numbers that you already put up there you're going back to what the air what the temp air temperatures are all right so I got 64 it's 53 it's gonna rise and so what I'm gonna do is take 64 and I'm gonna subtract the dry adiabatic lapse rate

[1:00] which is five point four I get fifty eight point six and then I compare over here it's once warmer than 48 so we're gonna keep on going sounds subtract another five point four which is fifty three point two and that's warmer than 46 subtract another five point four that's forty seven point eight which is warmer than forty three

[1:31] so I'm gonna keep going and I get forty two point four which is one more than forty two so it's gonna keep on going and so I'm just testing every thousand feet subtract another five point four and I get 37 now 37 warmer than 36 but you've got to keep track of what's happening because that's

[2:02] also the dew point so as you're doing this keep checking to see that you you know you want to make sure you you realize it if you hit the dew point okay so as you do these calculations keep checking down and saying okay my dewpoints 37 do I hit 37 right there I do so at this point okay so right there the temperature is equal to the dew point therefore we know

[2:34] that the relative humidity is a hundred percent all right so now remember what we said once you are so we're this is the beginning of the cloud once you have a cloud then you are instead of subtracting five point four you're subtracting in this class two point seven and the reason for that is because the addition of latent heat helps keep the atmosphere warmer than it normally would be alright so I've got my thirty seven and then subtract this time two

[3:06] point seven and that gets me thirty four point three still warmer there then the surrounding air so it's gonna rise and continue to rise a cloud continues to grow okay subtract two point seven thirty one point six okay that's warmer than thirty so it continues to grow cloud continues to grow and subtract two point seven

[3:38] again I get twenty eight point nine okay now notice here that 31.6 war were the thirty one twenty eight point nine almost but not quite twenty nine so what that tells us is that the cloud will rise past this point and almost but not quite get to this point so I want to draw it to show that it's between those two lines like that and then where does the air go well it comes out the top and

[4:08] sinks back down so I'm gonna draw a few arrows to show that okay all right so now let's go to date two so on the handouts probably on the other side or the second page and so the set up here is actually the bottom part is almost same okay so the conditions down here are the same and in fact temperatures down here are the same the only thing that's changed is we've brought in some colder air aloft so we've got cold air

[4:38] that's coming down from the north we're gonna see how that changes things so the first thing I'm gonna do is we're gonna do this location right here so I've got 85 greater than 84 so I know it's gonna rise subtract 5.4 seventy nine point six seventy four point two I'm just subtracting five point four each time

[5:12] okay so warmer than the air around it rises warmer than air around it rises warmer than air rises not warmer than air around it so somewhere between here and here that air stops rising and then sinks back down okay and this is exactly what we got on day one so this is exactly the same answer nothing's changed here no cloud okay why is there no cloud we didn't cool it to the dewpoint all

[5:43] right so let's go to this second one here okay so 76 minus five point four seventy point six five point four sixty five point two five point four fifty nine point eight and so I'm just subtracting five point four here and I'm checking as I go along to make sure that I'm warmer than the air around it which I am now

[6:17] here forty nine we've hit the dew point okay so right there temperature so you go to the dew point and the relative humidity is a hundred percent okay that's the that one right there is that is the flat bottom of our cloud which then is going to start growing vertically okay so now remember I'm going to subtract 2.7 from now on because now I'm

[6:49] inside a cloud two point seven forty six point three forty three point six forty point 938 point two so let me see warmer than the air around it warmer than the air around it warmer warmer so our cloud continues to grow so I'm gonna keep drawing here thirty five point five thirty two point eight thirty

[7:29] point one okay so what we're seeing here is that the cloud is growing growing the air is continuing to rise so this is what our cloud is doing roll grow grow I didn't draw it very straight my cloud is leaning a little bit but that's because it's hard to use this whole projector and not be crooked so here we are at thirty point one and still warmer than the air around it so subtract two point seven again I get

[7:59] twenty seven point four still warmer than air around it so the cloud just keeps on going off the page okay so the point to this is that this cloud starts in the same place that it does on day one but because we've got extra cold air up here it helps the cloud grow and grow and grow alright we'll do the last one here okay so 64 warmer than 53 so I think 64 point

[8:34] is five point four fifty eight point six that's five point four fifty three point two minus five point four forty seven point eight minus five point four 42.4 okay now let's just see what we're doing here warmer warmer warmer warmer so air is rising have we hit the dew point we

[9:04] gotta get down to 37 for the dew point we haven't got there yet subtract 5.4 37 okay so there we hit the dew point so right there oops off screen here temperature is equal to the dew point relative humidity is 100% we get the formation the beginning of our cloud so then from from this point forward remember I subtract

[9:34] two point seven so two point seven is thirty four point three two point seven thirty one point six so again I'm checking warmer warmer warmer so my cloud is growing and growing alright so then let's subtract two point seven twenty eight point nine two point

[10:04] seven twenty six point two and just like the other cloud as we go up here we can see that the temperatures continue to stay warmer than the surrounding air so this one like the other one grows off the page okay so the point two doing all this was to illustrate that if you want air to rise to make a cloud the hotter the air is near the surface the easier

[10:36] it will rise through the atmosphere right it's like it's got a better start the hotter it is but if you made the air colder up here that also helps air rise so we can make air rise really high if we start out really hot or we can make it rise really high if we make the air above our heads really cold and so this is what we're doing here and is causing the clouds to grow and so what we'll do in the next lecture is explain well then what happens when these clouds keep growing like what

[11:06] ultimately happens to them okay all right thanks
