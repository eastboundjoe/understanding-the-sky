hey I'm Elle strong in this lecture is on convective weather and convective storms and it follows the previous lecture I gave which was on convection in the atmosphere so watch the introductory lecture - convection in the atmosphere first and then come back and watch this and it will make more sense but what we've said so far is that when you look out you see a bunch of little puffy clouds what we now know is that underneath each one of these is a rising plume of air and the reason the air would want to rise is because if I look out here I see a variety of vegetation variety of textures a variety of terrain and so the temperature temperatures out here are not all the same so places where it's warmer will want to rise preferentially and so you get these plumes of rising warm air that we call thermals as they rise they expand as they expand they cool and eventually that air is cooled down to its dew point and when that happens you get a saturation of the air and the relative humidity is a hundred percent from that point forward you have a cloud and whether or not the air continues to rise just depends on whether or not it's still warmer than the air around it so this lecture basically focuses on the question of what happens if this cloud continues to grow but first let's talk about some sources of heat so down here the sources of heat are just simply the the Sun but what you could have is you could have something like maybe a fire so we have a source of heat here and you can see the smoke but then right here something happens and above this point you've got a cumulus cloud and this cumulus cloud is a mixture now of cloud and smoke this rising warm air expands and cools hits the dew point right here and you get a saturation so this is called a pyrocumulus clouds that's a cumulus cloud that forms over a fire now it may seem weird that you can condense water out of smoke but remember the air already has some water vapor in it and then a fire actually adds water to the air whenever you burn fuel whenever you burn hydrocarbons we talked about this in the previous lecture and adds water vapor to the air so it's pretty common that you get cumulus clouds forming over fires here's another one you can see exactly the point where temperature must equal dew point right there we go from all smoke below to smoke and a whiter cloud above this is a kind of lousy video but it's a time-lapse of a wildfire and it's showing that you can see rising plumes of smoke and warm air and you can see the point where it where the air cools until it hits the dew point temperature it's the dew point and we get saturation and we get clouds so you can see you know the white is the pyrocumulus clouds forming over the hot fire you can also get them over volcanoes so you've got a source of heat down here this black material is what we call ash and ash our tiny little fragments of rock and glass that are coming out of the volcano but right there you notice it changes and you got this puffiness so this is ash plus cloud and so as the air is rising it's cooling and eventually the temperature equals the dew point and you get a cloud that's also growing in with the ash coming out of the volcano sometimes as humans we create clouds and so this is an illustrate an example of one such case think about all of the things that we have blacktopped so big parking lots airports we pave over large areas with dark material and it gets really hot so this is an example of an Air Force Base in Florida so everyday Sun comes up warms up the the blacktop and that warm air starts to rise it then condenses forms a cloud and that cloud sits over the Air Force Base but the wind blows it off to the side so you get this kind of elongate cloud that goes off into the distance so this is what it looks like so we're standing at the Air Force Base there's that cloud you can see the winds blowing it off into the distance so they basically have this cloud that just sits there all day long day after day after day another source of heat our mountains and so to illustrate this imagine that we have mentally we don't have a mountain first and we've got a flat terrain and as I go up in the atmosphere I would notice that the temperature gets cooler and cooler and cooler and cooler with height okay that's what you'd expect but now let's imagine that we stick a mountain in this okay so when the Sun comes out and warms the earth we'll talk more about this in a future lecture but for the most part sunlight just travels right through the atmosphere and doesn't affect it but it impacts the the surface of things it will warm them up so here you have this surface sitting up in the air so right here are the temperature up there is 40 degrees right here maybe when the Sun comes up it warms it to 50 right and up here with the temperatures 30 maybe the Sun hits it and warms up to 40 so the point is you've got this thing that's up in the atmosphere that's warmer than the atmosphere around it so what'll happen is air will start to rise above the mountain and if it rises enough then we start to get condensation and a cloud will form above the mountain so this is what happens around here a lot so if you live in Albuquerque a lot of times you'll notice in the summer that will get cumuliform clouds that start over the Sandia's and in fact this is what it would look like if you were to climb to the top of a mountain and look up during when this is happening so right here where I'm standing looking straight up there is warm air rising above our heads going straight up and then hitting the dew point you're turning into a cumulus cause this is what the bottom of a cumulus cloud looks like right where the warm air rises off the surface and so this cloud just kind of sits to here for hours growing you can see there's movement in here but the cloud pretty much stays in one spot here's another view of it so what we've been saying so far is that you know thermals you can't see thermals right when the warm air rises from the surface but this one the warm air is rising right in front of us and so right here you should be able to make out that the warm air is rising right there and going into that cloud so right there the temperature equals dew point and you're getting 100% relative humidity saturation and a cloud so when you look from space you can actually see this effect really clearly and I've got a satellite image here I'm at a website called world view from NASA and right now I'm looking down over here over New Mexico you can go to this site if you want if you do the date down here will be the current date and you can change it too so I'm looking at July 18 2017 just happen to be a day where this happens but it but this is pretty common well on the show here what you see is you see that there are clouds in certain areas and then not others right so these areas that are kind of darker green are higher elevation they're higher elevation they get more precipitation and therefore have more vegetation we'll talk later on about why they have more precipitation on mountains but they do so for example here we got mountains we get a valley we got mountains and you can see that the clouds are preferentially forming over the mountains in fact we can go down here and that gray blob right there is Albuquerque okay so there's a Sandhya's and you see this clouds over the Sandia's you go a little bit to the north as a side here you see this thing so this is this fuzziness are ice crystals coming off of a cumulonimbus cloud so that's the anvil as seen from above so this is the cumulonimbus this is the the anvil that's spreading out with all the ice in it in fact if I go back down here so getting back down to Albuquerque this one right here is another one you can see but the fuzziness of it and a lot of times what will happen is that the cumulonimbus will form over the Sandia's and then move on and continue to drift across the city this time of day by the shadows I would estimate it's probably a late morning and so what we notice a lot of times in the summer is that the first clouds you'll see are over the mountains and then once they grow sometimes they'll drift off and go somewhere else but they typically start over the mountains a related idea is what happens when you have land surrounded by water so this is the peninsula this is Florida right here and so you get water on both sides of the peninsula and you can see how many more clouds are actually over the peninsula than the water so we'll talk about this in a future lecture but the ocean doesn't change its temperature much day-to-day and so the temperature in the water here is pretty consistent day and night whereas the temperatures on the on the land vary quite a bit more between day and night so during the day the land heats up more than the water and you get rising air and you get a whole bunch of cumuliform clouds out of this so one of the things that we are going to get into here is try to figure out what happens when a convection cell grows to different heights and we have some terms to describe how high they grow so the same backwards but in weather when we talk about how high a convection cell grows we call that it's depth okay so if I have shallow convection that means that convective cells are not going very high if I have deep convection that means the cells are going much higher up into the atmosphere so shallow convection are days where we might have no clouds at all the thermals don't even get high enough to even make a cloud or you get small cumulus clouds deep convection you get these really tall towering cumulus or maybe even cumulonimbus so we're going to show you some examples here so these are some cumulus that are growing so we're over the sandy as we get a warm air rising off the mountain but you'll notice that these cumulus don't really grow very high right they're kind of staying about this height and you watch them they'll grow and they'll die but they never get much taller than this okay so that's pretty shallow convection so the thermals are rising from the surface and then they get about that high and then they sink back down here's another example so a lot more convection happening in terms of plumes of warm air rising but you'll notice that all these things aren't very tall there's a limit as to how tall each one these cumulus clouds are if you watch this for a while you'll see some of them like that one's going to die there and then another one's going to form so they're farming and dying all the time as these thermals rise hit the dew point and then cool back down now what if we are able to convict a little bit more and so this is what's happening here so we might call this moderate convection we've got a thermal right here you can see that this is right where the warm air is rising it from the mountain going into the bottom of the cloud and now the conditions are a little different in this cloud is able to grow vertically and it's growing a lot more than it did in the previous movies so we might say yeah this is moderate convection it's it's growing these convection cells are definitely growing more than they did earlier here's a another pretty significant convection cell we might even go as far as to call this deep convection here so that here that the mountain again is warm in the daytime sending up a Puma warm air and forming this big convective cell right above it so question is then why is it that some days I get convection that's deep and sometimes it's shallow so there's several reasons but one of them is just simply how hot is the air down here where it rises so some of the earlier movies I showed you that convective cells were very shallow it was early in the morning they weren't very warm yet now this one is later in the afternoon and you can see that they're starting to grow taller taller so you'll see this one now notice that fuzz there so at some point and we'll see it again here at some point there's some fuzz right there these convective cells will grow tall enough that they're going to be forming ice crystals and if you might remember from the cloud lecture that ice looks fuzzy right so you can see how this one's starting to come and make an anvil shape a little bit but it's a different texture right there there's some fuzz right there so there's a nice okay so these clouds have our mixture they're a mixture of ice and liquid the the hard definite boundaries that's liquid or it starts to get more kind of fuzzy on the edges that's ice okay and this is important for what we're going to be talking about next but in order to make precipitation in order to turn a cumulus into a cumulonimbus we have to make ice so here's another example and again you can see the sharp definite boundaries here that is liquid but up here you're starting to see see that fuzz right there it's a little fuzzy on the edges this is starting to make ice okay and the ice is going to be starting to form near the top of the cloud so one more movie here of convection and so here see the fuzz right through there a little bit okay so as this thing convex you'll see areas that will start to turn a little bit fuzzy I carry some over here a little bit there son right there that's ice okay so at the top of a really tall convecting cell you will form ice now that ice is going to be really important here because what's going to happen is that ice is what's ultimately going to be responsible for nucleating precipitation so this is an image that we saw in the previous lecture and we were talking about how the cloud droplets are actually microscopic and rain droplets are raindrops themselves are you know several millimeters across and so the question is well then how do we get how do we go from little tiny microscopic drops to these relatively giant raindrops so most people have the impression that cloud droplets will just grow and grow and grow until they're so big they become rain and they fall out and it turns out that actually does not happen it can happen in a few places with really really high dew points like in the tropics but where we live that pretty much does not happen there's a different process at work that's going to get us from these little tiny microscopic drops to big raindrops that are big enough that you can you know hold in your hand so let's imagine that we've got one of these really tall cumulus clouds it's got some fuzz on top that's our ice and the ice itself would be a little tiny microscopic particles a little tiny crystals floating in the air and they're gonna drift their way down into the rest of the cloud and before we talk about what happens next we'll talk a little bit about how weird water behaves in the cloud because down here on the surface we're used to the idea that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or zero degrees centigrade so if I have a bowl of water and it's sitting out at 32 I know that eventually it'll completely freeze but the weird thing is that if you have really really really tiny microscopic droplets of water which is what we have on clouds because remember cloud droplets are microscopic when they're this tiny they have very little surface area it turns out that what liquid water can stay in the liquid state below the freezing point in fact it can stay liquid all the way down the minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit which happens to also be minus 40 degrees centigrade so these little droplets out in the cloud even though the temperature is below freezing they stay in their liquid form and that's called supercooled water okay so in our cloud there's actually three zones at the top we have all ice and the top part of the cloud is going to be usually less than minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit or so below that we have what's called the mix portion of the cloud it's ice and supercooled water okay and by water I mean liquid right and so then below that you know it gets warmer as you go down we get to the part that's all liquid and this part is going to be above 32 right this is called the warm part of the cloud okay so if you were to watch what was happening up here in this ice what you would notice is that as the ice these little tiny microscopic ice crystals when they drift down into the supercooled part of the cloud you would notice that those ice crystals start to grow and they get bigger and what's happening here is another unusual process that we don't experience in everyday life and what happens is if you were to take ice crystals and put them in the presence of supercooled water so this represents the cloud droplet and this represents the little tiny microscopic ice crystals floated in from above that water molecules will preferentially attach themselves to the ice in other words they're actually abandoned ship they'll leave the supercooled to liquid the little cloud droplet and they'll attach themselves to the ice so what happens is the ice crystals start to grow and get bigger as the cloud droplets become smaller so in our cloud what happens is this area is called the Bergeron process that's the name for this and the Bergeron process produces and I'm making these way larger than they would be the scale to the rest of the cloud but eventually you get to something that you might recognize because at some point you make something that looks like a snowflake and so these snowflakes fall and if you were up in this part of the cloud you think oh it's snowing and the snow falls and it heads towards the warmest part of the cloud and when it passes through to the warmest part of the cloud the snowflakes melt and then each one of those snowflakes melts to become a raindrop and by the way I'm drawing raindrops in a very incorrect manner but every time you see rain drawn into cartoon they're always drawn like little teardrops but that's not that's not true at all raindrops are actually perfectly spherical when they fall through the atmosphere but when they when they hit your window they turn into a teardrop shape so that's why everybody does that so I'm propagating some misinformation here but anyway these then fall out of the cloud as precipitation and at this point once you have precipitation falling out of the bottom of the cloud then you have a cumulonimbus so we can watch this process and so let's pay attention to this one right here so that's a cumulus cloud right now not really any ice to speak of it's got a flat bottom there's air that's rising up as thermals hitting the dew point relative humidity a hundred percent all that good stuff going up into the cloud and the cloud is growing and getting taller so this material up there will see that that's starting to look like some ice up there okay we're getting a little bits of ice keep watching it here there's a little bit of fuzz there okay now over here that's definitely starting to look like ice it's getting a fuzzy edge on it and then down here if you watch right there we're starting to see precipitation okay so we got ice for sure right there we got precipitation coming out of the bottom of the cloud there so now we've got cumulonimbus now sometimes what falls out of the cloud could still be snow and the snow a melt on its way down or sometimes it melts within the cloud but the point is that every will every raindrop is a melted snowflake so if it is raining down here it's snowing up there now if you lived in the tropics it turns out that this process isn't required and there are so much water vapor in the atmosphere in the tropics the mixing ratios or the dew points are so high that actually you can get direct condensation of cloud droplets into bigger droplets that then fall as rain and so this is a diagram from a textbook where it shows these coalescing cloud droplets that become a bigger raindrop and as it falls down it crashes into more of them and then it'll break apart into further ones and they will they will come out at the bottom of the cloud that no ice isn't necessary but where we live and pretty much anywhere in North America we need the Bergeron process to make rain okay so that's pretty much always happening in our part of the of the world now another thing that happens is we've been talking about up until now we've been talking about how the clouds have air moving up into them right we did the whole convection activity what's still happening with this so there's warm air that's rising and entering the cloud and going up into the cloud and it forms this upgoing draft that's called the updraft and in fact this part of the cloud right here where they where the air is going in is some kind of sometimes called the intake so there's actively air moving into the cloud now the other thing that's happening is we've got precipitation that's being formed on this side so you've got another draft that's going in the opposite direction so you've got air that's moving downwards and this downward moving current is called the downdraft and the downdraft comes out the bottom of the cloud with the precipitation so if I look at a typical thunderstorm here in Albuquerque so there is the precipitation so the downdraft is occurring right here we've got there would be some kind of wind vertical wind coming down with that the intake the updraft is happening somewhere over here so somewhere over here is where the air is going up into the cloud now what can happen is that these downdraft winds can pick up a lot of speed for reasons we'll discuss in a second and as they pick up speed they come down and they come crashing into the ground by picking up speed I mean we've actually measured some in excess of 70 miles an hour comes straight down and when they hit the ground they splat and so you can see how you've got rain coming straight down and then it's like it's squishing outwards that is wind in this kind of downdraft we have a really strong vertical wind associated with it it's called a microburst so anybody that's down there right now is not only getting rain but it's getting a strong wind associated with it so here's an illustration of how that would look so remember that up in the cloud the relative humidity is a hundred percent so there's no evaporation taking place as soon as raindrops leave the leave the cloud and go into the air column below the cloud they're entering an environment where the relative humidity is less than 100% because that happens the raindrops are subject to evaporation if you live in a dry climate like we do you might have really low relative humidities down here and what that means is you get evaporation of the raindrops as they're falling if raindrops evaporate remember from several lectures ago that removes latent heat from the system see if to imagine water molecules leaving with their little boxes of thermal energy in this diagram that means this air column that's now raindrops and air and the whole thing is being cooled by the removal latent heat this whole column here is becoming cold and when you make something when you make Eric Holder it becomes denser and it becomes denser it sinks faster so this whole blob becomes a sinking blob of cold air that's accelerating towards the surface of the earth and it hits again like I said you hit 70 miles an hour has nowhere to go except out and so it produces these winds that move out in all directions those are called the outflow so back in our diagram here we can add this in so if this is happening in our in our cloud where it hits the ground and spreads out this cold air has a name it's called the outflow and right at the boundary where this occurs this is called the gust front and we'll talk more about that in a second but right now with the way that we've drawn this this area right in here is where the microburst is occurring right so if you live right here during this you're getting a lot of rain and a lot of wind as well so here's an example of what we call a wet microburst and you can tell us a microburst because you can see it spreading out on the edges there so there must be some pretty strong wind that's coming down hitting the ground and spreading out so here's some video footage from a microburst occurring in Phoenix and you can see that this is the column this is the downdraft you can even see it moving in this and it hits the ground and spreads out so people that are living down there are experiencing not only high amounts of rain but high winds as well and you can see it's spreading out to the side there right so even people out here are experiencing the outflow the wind that's coming from this a severe thunderstorm here's another one from Tucson and so this one it's during the middle of this a downpour it's going to generate a microburst and they're going to zoom in on it you can see it come too and splat against the surface down there they'll show it a couple more times here because here it is again so there's a blob of cold air comes down splat and then again so each time you see this they're just showing the same thing over and over but it's a particularly cold blob of air accelerates on the way down splats against the ground creates a high wind that spreads out in all directions so anybody down here is experiencing not only rain but a sudden pretty strong cold wind the fact this is what it looks like from the ground in one of these and then we're somewhere in Arizona and we're under a thunderstorm but the microburst hasn't started yet there it is and we can get hurricane-force winds you know they don't last long but enough to do a lot of damage they'll knock over trees and houses and cars and all kinds of stuff now there is another type of microburst what we just saw was something called the wet microburst because it's raining at the surface or it gets wet there's also something called a dry microburst and we are particularly prone to these in New Mexico and Arizona so what we're looking at here is we got some kind of cumulonimbus up off the screen here and these streaks that's rain that's coming down and it's evaporating on the way to the surface well as its evaporating as a as we just said you're losing latent heat so you're making this column of air cold and we call this vergis of vergas whenever you have rain that just disappears on the way to the ground so here it is again so there's rain that's falling is liquid but the air column down here is pretty dry low relative humidity you get evaporation evaporation evaporation and then finally there's nothing left you're standing down here you're not getting rained on even though the rains falling above your head but what is happening is the evaporation of all that rain is removing latent heat and you're making a column of really cold air that's really dense and it sinks down and go splat against the surface it just doesn't have any water with it we call that the dry microburst so here's one so we can't see the cumulonimbus that's up off the screen here but there's a blob of invisible cold air that has sunk down hit the ground and you can see it's spreading out so if you're down here the experiences is all of a sudden it got really windy and they heard suddenly got colder usually here's another one it looks like there's a look to you like somebody just dropped something out of the cloud and went down and went splat that's pretty much what happened there was some rain that came out it completely evaporated made a blob of sinking cold air accelerates runs into the ground that's all dust down there that's all dust from the winds from the dry microburst now microbursts can be pretty dangerous and if I go back to this picture that we just drew this so it's dangerous to be down here in in the microburst but this outflow is going to keep going in the front of this this gust front here I mean it can still be moving along pretty good clip maybe so many miles an hour or something like that and it can do a lot of damage so a few years ago Indiana State Fair they're setting up for a concert and there's a thunderstorm that's coming and you can see in the distance there and the thunderstorm produces a microburst which makes the outflow the outflow wind comes and basically invades the fair and knocks over this whole stadium set up and killed I think seven people and injured about 50 or so so that is the outflow that did that another thing that can happen is if you have if you live in a place that's very very dry like where we live as this outflow is going across the surface not only is it doing damage just from the wind but it can be blowing up a big cloud of dust and you essentially make a big dust storm and that's called a haboob it's a Arabic term from the Middle East they get a lot of those over there here's a picture one and there are some famous images in movies of who boobs from the Phoenix area and so we got a cumulonimbus here and it's generating an outflow so this this whole thing is a big blob of cold air creeping along the surface and the as it moves across the surface everybody that's in its way gets covered in dust so there's another picture of it from above so here's a good time lapse of a haboob again this was from Phoenix area here it comes you notice also that there's clouds right above it that grow along with it that's because as the cold air comes along the ground it shows up the other air out of the way and actually will form clouds above it and sometimes will trigger new thunderstorms here's another one here's some excerpts from again another YouTube clip where this guy drives into the who boobs so here you can see the edge of it so that would be the guest front right along the edge and he's going to drive right into it because why not and as he does so you'll see that at its peak it pretty much looks like night and later on in the semester we'll talk about droughts and if you've heard about the Dust Bowl drought in the 1930s they were dealing with this kind of on a regular basis in places like Oklahoma so this is the middle of day and it's starting to look like the middle of the night so this might explain something that you've experienced yourself if you live in New Mexico you be at home it'll be a nice clear day no clouds no wind completely calm and all of a sudden out of nowhere you said they're hit by this blast of wind like where did that come from well it could have been an outflow so what might be happening is clerk on the other side of the state like maybe in Carlsbad they've got a severe thunderstorm and they get a strong downdraft which then turns into a strong outflow and believe it or not the outflows can go all the way across the state and you can track them on radar I've tracked them on radar all the way from Eastern New Mexico clear into Arizona and and so it's so far away that you actually don't even see any clouds right I mean the the cumulonimbus itself is clear out of sight so that's something that we actually experience here especially in June and then into the monsoon season you may experience these outflows that just come out of nowhere so another one of the hazards of convective storms is that of hail and scientists are still trying to work out exactly how hail forms but it seems pretty apparent that hail must have to spend longer in the cumulonimbus cloud than standard rain and one of the clues is that often hail has these growth rings so if you cut up chunk of hail open especially a large one you'll see these concentric rings and if you think about what we've talked about so far with these convective storms so the story is you know we create a snowflake the snowflake falls and melts and one snowflake makes one drain raindrop which comes out the bottom but we also have these pretty strong down drafts and updrafts and they're right next to each other in the cloud so it's been speculated that what happens if some of these raindrops somehow got caught up in this updraft and they have brought back up to the top into the into the frozen part of the cloud and then they came back down and as they did so they would grow another growth ring and maybe if the conditions were right they could go around in and around several times so that's one idea now some of the most recent research shows that actually that's probably not what happens probably what happens is that the initial raindrop falls down and then gets picked up and probably spend several kind of paths back and forth up in this supercool part of the cloud before falling back down so it's not necessarily a loop-de-loop as much as it is updrafts just kind of giving it a little push now and then to keep it in the cloud for a little bit longer so locally we have a pretty famous hailstorm that occurred is Koro 2004 and these are some pictures from that storm as you can see there are some you know baseball sized hail that came down during the storm storm lasted something like 45 minutes and these are some pictures from people's backyards where the hailstones just smashed everybody's lawn furniture and New Mexico Tech was in session so the students come out to find their cars all beat up like this one or something like that and occasionally even today you'll see a banged up car in Socorro with the bumper sticker saying I survived the hailstorm I also posted a document on learn that was kind of goes over some of the damage and some of the results from the Socorro hailstorm here's some pictures where the all the back windows are broken out these are cars at New Mexico Tech again this is when this picture was taken it was the largest ever measured hail stone I'm not sure if it still is or not but this is from Oklahoma and if you look at this it kind of looks like a you see a bunch of individual hailstones that are all kind of stuck together like a conglomerate here and the biggest hailstones don't come from New Mexico they do tend to come from the Midwest and we'll talk a little bit here exactly what's going on with that sometimes you can see the hail come down as it's kind of bright white it's called the hail shaft and it looks significantly wider than normal precipitation does of course one of the most dangerous hazards of convective storms is that of lightning and lightning it turns out is not very well understood it's very difficult to study because it can kill you so there's a few things that we know and it's been observed that in a lot of thunderstorms cumulonimbus clouds that there's an excess of electrons in the bottom part of the cloud and the deficiency of electrons in the top part of the cloud so if you have excess electrons that means you have a negative charge down here you don't have enough electrons you have a positive charge up there now what would cause this so if you've ever taken a balloon and you rub it on your hair and it sticks to the wall so what you've done there is the motion of you rubbing it on your hair moves the electrons from one spot to another spot and then it gets a static charge so remember that in the cumulonimbus right we've got the updraft we've got the downdraft and they're right next to each other so it's very likely you've got places in the cloud where you've got air sliding past each other and maybe that's stripping off electrons from one part of the cloud and bringing them to another maybe I'm probably more realistic possibility is that if you have solid particles like ice crystals and they bang into each other that also strips electrons off so it might be either one or some of both that do this but in a typical cloud you've got these electrons near the bottom and you've got a deficiency near the top and these electrons what they want is they want to get up to here that's where they'd like to be well it also turns out that you've got positive charges down here on the ground so the earth itself has a slight positive charge especially compared to the bottom of this cloud well when that charge builds up to a certain point the electrons start coming out of the cloud in what's called a step the leader so this is not lightning yet it's some ionized gas that comes out of the cloud and these electrons don't know where they're going so it's just kind of a random pattern and they in the branch and as they get closer to the ground the positive charges that are down here you know they were you know opposite charges attract so they're attracted to this so they're going to start climbing tall things and they're going to make a little branch up into the air okay so these guys don't know where these guys are these guys don't know where those guys are but they can sense each other and that there's a there's a mutual attraction between the positive and they give the charges well eventually one of these step leaders which again is just randomly moving it doesn't know where it's going will accidentally come in contact with one of these and these are called streamers that the positive charges from the below so the step leader accidentally hits a streamer and now you've got a connection between the excess of electrons down here and a deficiency of electrons down there and the result is this is actually the lightning strike that you see so all this step leader business that I just drew that all happens within milliseconds and you don't see it what you see is when these two things touch each other and completes the circuit and you get lightning you get a current and the current actually flows from ground to cloud see if you slow down lightning what you'll see is you will see the lightning discharged going up into the cloud and that's the part you see even those fraction of a second that's what you see and everything that came before that is invisible to the eye now I've got some video here that has been slowed down a lot and we can kind of see these stepped leaders a little bit so here's the first one now but you'll see here come the step leaders out of the cloud now the grounds down here that one did not hit the ground you can see they're just kind of randomly shooting out they don't know where they're going this is not lightning yet that one came close and all of a sudden right there one of them hit the ground okay and that's the actual lightning that you see okay so I've got another one here again slowed down a lot here come the step leaders you can see them coming down and then bang those two hit the ground about the same time and then you get a return current and that's the lightning bolt that you actually see now watch these two buildings those two things those are the streamers streamers are very difficult to photograph so we have just a few images of them right there I think there's one more here right there okay so that so if you go on YouTube you can find videos of the step leaders coming down it's very difficult to find footage of the streamers going up there they're a lot harder to photograph but we have a few now the other thing that could happen besides these electrons coming down and hitting the ground is they could also in fact get up here and join the rest of the cloud up there right because they just want to get to a positive charge doesn't matter which way they do it so you could also have if the charge builds up you could also have a connection between these two parts of the cloud and you get lightning in the cloud or you can get lightning from cloud to cloud and in fact when people have flown planes intentionally flown planes through thunderstorms to study this kind of stuff what they often find is that in a typical thunderstorm that you might have a pocket a positive charge in one spot and then you'll have a pocket of negative charge in another spot and you can have several pockets in different places and you'll get charging from you know discharging I should say from one to the other well you'll get lightning will flash from one part of the cloud to the other part of the cloud or from one part of the cloud from one cloud to another cloud so you might get lightning from here to here you might get lightning from here to here so not all lightning is to the ground you can get what's called inter cloud and intra-cloud lightning so if you ever go on YouTube there's a user named Pecos Hank and he takes just fabulous lightning movies and he has like hundreds of these videos so this is all intercloud and intra-cloud lightning and you can see there's very little lightning actually going to the ground it's going you know from cloud to cloud or within one part of the cloud to another but all lightning is the same thing its electrons want to get from one place to another and when the charge builds up high enough they can finally break down the air and make their own path and that's what creates the lightning bolt so associated with lightning is Thunder and the lightning bolt itself is about six to eight inches wide and so that during that brief instant when electricity is flowing through the lightning bolt you've got this six to eight inch air column that's being heated to thousands of degrees and when you heat air air expands so what that means is as the lightning is happening the air in that column is being pushed out because it's so hot but then when the lightnings over with there's nothing to keep that air column hot and so the lightnings over with there's a very little air in here and it's like a vacuum and the surrounding air slaps that call them back together and that's what makes thunder so every time you have lightning it's generating thunder now thunder moves at the speed of sound and the speed of sound is it can go about one mile every five seconds so when you see a flash in the distance if you start counting one-mississippi two-mississippi three-mississippi then when you hear the thunder you will know how many miles away that lightning is right so if you count to 15 seconds then it's about three miles away now a kind of a weird thing happens if you're over 20 or so miles away it kind of depends on the conditions but it turns out sound waves when they travel long distances they refract upwards and if you're over 20 miles from from a lightning storm you will actually hear the Thunder it's actually moved up and refracted over your head and I get this question sometimes from students asking me about heat lightning and this is kind of a folklore that there's certain kind of lightning that you can't hear but that's not true all lightning makes thunder but if you're too far away from it you just don't hear it so you see flashes in the distance but you never hear the Thunder so we've been talking about all kinds of hazards associated with the downdraft right we talked about the outflow and the haboob and all that stuff there's also some hazards associated with the updraft and one of them is quite simple which is that if you are in an ultralight aircraft or a balloon or parachuter you don't want to get too close to this cloud because you could literally get sucked up into the cloud and there's an aviation term for this it's called cloud suck and so cloud suck is a real thing and occasionally people get sucked up into the clouds when they don't want to be kind of a famous accident in 1925 this is a blimp the shenandoah and it got too close to one of these convecting clouds got sucked up in it and crashed and if you pay attention to the news every once in a while you will run across people who have been sucked up into clouds during uh you know hang gliding or paragliding almost always they die this woman somehow or another lived and apparently she got sucked up into a cloud immediately went unconscious spent like an hour in that in this cloud I was covered in ice and somehow or another survived all this but most people do not of course the most common hazard of the intake or the updraft is the tornado and if conditions are right and you have really strong convection the intake the updraft actually can start forming a tornado and I just loved this video because this guy he's actually driving towards the tornado and this is one of the cleanest views I've ever seen of a tornado it's so much so that it kind of looks fake right like if you saw that in a movie you being that that's fake so in order to get a tornado you need some very vigorous convection you need very unstable air but you also need a couple other things one thing you need is something called wind shear and when shear means that the wind is blowing stronger above your head than it is near the surface and what that does is it makes the air near the ground kind of spin in a circle right then you've got thermals so what we talked about except the thermals now are going to push that spinning air upwards and if it does it just right you can take that spinning air and reorient it vertically and then the air intake the updraft is spinning and you get a tornado now if you look at tornadoes across the country there's definitely a spot that is weather far more common we call this Tornado Alley and it's kind of centered here in Oklahoma and so we're gonna talk a little bit about why this is before I do notice that you know the tornadoes looks like in this map they completely stop right there that's not entirely true here's another way that you can look at tornadoes so this is 56 years of tornado tracks everyone these blue lines and again like most of them are out here and something is causing them to stop right around here but they don't completely go away and you can see there's a little blue lines all over the place here where there have been tornadoes so imagine if we just cut the country right in half right through here right through Tornado Alley and we kind of looked at it from the side so we make what's called a cross-section right through the country and we got south to the right north to the left what kind of air is over here off in other words if we went south of the country where do we end up we end up in the Gulf of Mexico right so what's the air from there like well it's going to be very warm and gonna have very high dew points right so a lot of water in that air air from the north is coming down from Canada and it's going to be very cold and very dry yes we got cold and dry coming from the north so if these two air masses come together there's going to be a place kind of in the middle where you have warm air on the bottom and you have cold air on top now if you remember from the convection assignment we had one page where you you drew the clouds and they went up a certain height and then you went to the next page and we had cold air aloft and the clouds grew up off the page well that's kind of what's happening here because you've got warm air on the bottom and cold air on the top it's very easy for this warm air to convict upwards and you get really tall big strong cumulonimbus clouds and where do these two meet typically they meet right around Oklahoma so if I go back to this map I can imagine I've got warm humid air from the Gulf of Mexico coming from the south I got cold dry air coming from the north they kind of meet up in here so what so why doesn't it happen over here well the Rocky Mountains form a barrier for us us meaning us in New Mexico for the most part the the edge of the mountains prevents the cold air from coming down it kind of keeps it on the side of the mountains and it keeps the warm human air also on the side of the mountain so these mountains really kind of keep both of those pools of air away from us and so we don't have much you know we don't have a lot of really in stable air and we don't have really severe thunderstorms in this part of the country compared to over here in Tornado Alley so that's all we're going to talk about with convective storms I'm gonna leave you with some time lapse of some convective cells and next time we're going to talk about wind and air pressure and how those two things are connected thanks I'll see you next time you
