everybody this is just a little extra help on figuring out wind direction and so if you're just given a let's say in this case all I have is a high-pressure Center and let's say I've got a city here and I've got a city here now how do I figure out the wind direction so I have to know if it's northern hemisphere or southern hemisphere so let's just say this is northern hemisphere so I know I've got clockwise rotation around a high in the northern hemisphere so what what you imagine is this circle that's centered on the H that's coming around passing right through say a and then another circle that's coming around that's passing right through B okay now when we're figuring out wind ultimately what we have to do is draw a straight line segment because what we want the goal is that is to say the wind is blowing from the north west or south we need a single direction so it's not good enough to say that the the wind is curved we want to know what is the direction exactly at that point so this is if you remember tangents from math write a tangent of a circle this is what we're drawing so here the tangent to that circle at that point would be that so it's clockwise winds I know the winds come in this direction and it comes around and passes through a you'll become exactly from the north and wind is always described in the direction is coming from so this would be a north wind so if I asked you what you know describe the direction you would say north what would the direction be city B well exactly the same thing because you still have this cone around this is a tangent to the circle at that point also north and in fact any city I have here along this line these would all be north winds difference might be the speed but we're not trying to figure out the speed all we can do is figure out the direction here so let's pick another one let's say I said okay what's the wind direction here okay and again northern hemisphere so I figure okay this is I you know again think of a circle centered in the center of the H and I've got a clockwise rotation around the H what's the tangent at that point might look like this where's that wind coming from it's coming from the south west right it's coming from this area down there so this would be a south west wind so again when we describe when it's the direction it's coming from okay so let's do say another example and let's say I've got a low and I've got a high okay all right so let's say I've got a city let's say right here okay so what do I do and again if this is northern hemisphere counterclockwise think of it think of a circle going around the low and it's going to be going counterclockwise so you'll be coming to kind of right through here and what's the tangent of that circle at that point like this in which direction is it coming from it's coming from that it's coming from this direction which is south east so this is a south east wind now if you've got multiple pressure centers like a high and a low and I've got something in the middle and I want to know well which direction is it do I use the high or the low if I use the low I imagine a circle that's centered on the low coming this way so I'm gonna draw that okay and if I imagine the hi let me just have a Harrow to that if I imagine it coming around the hi I would have an arc go in this direction okay so clockwise are on the high counterclockwise are on the low the tangent to either one of those is the same answer so in this case it's from the south west so if you've got a high and a low and you have a point in the middle it doesn't matter how you think of it you'll get the same answer now what if I had a high and a high okay and I got a point right here so if you've got two of the same pressure go with the one you're closest to I'm closest to this one so I'm going to use the clockwise move rotation around the high draw my tangent okay and then I'd have an answer that's from the north west that's a northwest wind I will not give you one that's exactly in the middle because that one's actually you know you'd have to have more information to solve it because one of them would be going clockwise and going from one way and the other one would be coming around clockwise the other way and they cancel each other out so realistically what happens is there's basically no wind in the middle we didn't get into that doesn't matter okay so if you've got more than one pressure center go towards the one that's closest that's usually just the rule to remember okay so so that's how you do it if you don't have any contour lines if you do have contour lines the contour lines is the same thing except you'd know more information because the contour lines help you help guide you so on this one let's see so I've got a low right here in fact it's kind of split into two here so I'll just kind of put try this it's got it hello it's really kind of it's one single low but it's kind of broke it up into two blobs but all you need to know is that because this is a low and I'm in the northern hemisphere I've got counterclockwise circulation and what we said in this class is that we're gonna assume the wind was parallel to the contour lines so I draw a little wiggle straight segments again these are like tangents to the contour lines going around and then if I asked you say you know what is the you know what is the wind direction right here you would say well it's from the North West right that's a northwest wind and if you were over here on the high so here I've got these numbers are getting larger towards the center so this is an H right there and so I've got clockwise rotation around a high in the northern hemisphere so I know I've got wind coming this way and I just draw on little straight segments okay or if I was between contours same thing just stay parallel to the contours right so again if I asked you you know what's the what's the wind right here this one would be from the south west that's a southwest wind so the difference the only difference between these and the one that we just did is that here you don't have any additional information so you're assuming the winds are going circular around them when we have sea level pressure maps that contours give us some more information we can see that it's not perfectly a perfectly circular circulation but it's kind of this weird egg-shaped thing okay so I hope that helped if we if you get one that's in the southern hemisphere just remember the rules are reversed so around the hi in the southern hemisphere counterclockwise around the low in the southern hemisphere clockwise all right
