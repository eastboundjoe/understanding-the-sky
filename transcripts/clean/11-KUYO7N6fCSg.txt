hey how you doing this is Mel strong and this lecture is on temperature inversions and air pollution and we're going to start by looking at the structure of Earth's atmosphere now we know something about this because every day we launch weather balloons up into the atmosphere to collect data and here's an example of one of these weather balloons at this guy's holding he's got this whole box here and that box is called the radiosonde and it's like a little weather station and that a records temperature and humidity and wind and all this kinds of stuff and it beams it back to earth wirelessly so all he does is let go of this balloon and it goes up through the atmosphere and as it goes up it expands because we said rising parcels of air always have to expand and cool well eventually this will expand so much that it will pop and this will fall back to earth with a little parachute now there's a whole network of airports around the world that are designated spots to launch weather balloons and we do it every 12 hours and the reason for this is in weather forecasting you need to know what the conditions are up in the upper part of the atmosphere so it turns out that Albuquerque's Airport the Sunport is one of these airports that launches weather balloons so about five or six in the morning and five or six in the evening we'll launch one of these and as it goes up to the atmosphere it collects data and here's an example of some data that was collected as an afternoon on the July 4th and so this one probably went up at 5:00 in the afternoon and here on the x-axis that's air temperature in the y-axis is height so the red represents the temperature that the weather balloon a sensed as it was ascending up into the atmosphere so here at the surface you can see before the weather balloon was let go it was 90 degrees at the surface and as soon as it was launched the weather balloon noticed that it whether the air is getting colder with height and then it gets to about 50,000 feet and suddenly you notice that it starts getting warmer with height this inflection point right here we talked about before when we talked about clouds and how we said that this makes a natural break between two layers in the atmosphere this is called the tropopause and it's a surface between all the air below which is the troposphere and they all the air above which is the stratosphere now we didn't talk to the time why it gets warmer with height now in this case what happened is the weather one popped at about a hundred thousand feet but if it could have kept going it would have noticed that it continued to get warmer with height so if you could look up in this in the stratosphere what you would see is there a small number of these molecules of what we call ozone which are three oxygen molecules bonded together oh three an ozone hangs out there's not much of it up there but it hangs out in the in the stratosphere and if ultraviolet light comes in from the Sun and UV light is what gives you a sunburn right so we have UV light here at the surface but we don't have nearly as much at the surface as we would at the top of the atmosphere because when the UV light comes down through this ozone you know strike an ozone molecule and it'll break the ozone into two pieces and o2 and an O now eventually through a number of steps these two pieces will come back together and make a new ozone but when it breaks it apart two things happen for one the UV is blocked it doesn't reach the surface of the earth that's a good news for us and number two it releases a little bit of heat so all of these ozone molecules floating around up in the stratosphere are getting whacked with UV radiation all the time and as a result it's adding warmth to the stratosphere which is why the stratosphere actually gets warmer with height now the amount of UV that comes in from the upper atmosphere is so great that we wouldn't actually be able to exist on the surface if it wasn't for the ozone layer there's so much radiation coming from the Sun you're essentially sterilized the planet so the amount of UV that gives us sunburns is just a tiny tiny percent of the amount of UV would normally hit the surface if it wasn't for this ozone layer so this ozone layer is super beneficial to not just humans but to all life on Earth at least everything on the land but it's actually been declining over the past several decades so here we have a couple images of the ozone in the southern hemisphere and we're looking at colors that represent how much ozone is in the stratosphere so the blue represents very little ozone or as the greens and yellows that's more ozone that's the South Pole and you can kind of make out Antarctica down there so we've got to mid two images one in 1979 one in 2012 and you can see how it's more that blue is in the 2012 image this is what we what we refer to as the ozone hole is this area kind of centered in the southern hemisphere where UV radiation can go right through that and strike the surface below because there's very little ozone here now there's not a lot of people living in Antarctica so it hasn't been a huge hazard for human health but this was discovered in the 1980s and there is a big worry in that this ozone hole was going to continue to grow because they could see it growing and there's a there's a fear that it would actually engulf the whole planet and if it did if we lost the ozone layer you know we couldn't survive on land so it was a pretty big deal so scientists started looking at this in the 1970s and they realized that there is this family of molecules that we were manufacturing called chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs and they get their name because they have one at least one atom of chlorine one atom of fluorine and one atom of carbon in their molecular structure so here's a simple one called freon 11 and freon 11 is a type of refrigerant it's supposed to be inside the guts of a refrigerator or air-conditioner and as long as it's in there it's safe but if it ever gets out and it gets into the atmosphere and if it makes it way up to the stratosphere a CFC molecule will attach itself to an ozone it'll break it apart and then those two parts can't actually get back together like they could if they were broken apart by UV a single CFC molecule can destroy thousands of ozone molecules and back in the day they used CFCs for all kinds of things so they were a popular propellant in aerosol cans so if you had if you bought any kind of anything in a spray can back in the 70s it had CFCs as a propellant we use it as refrigerants and air conditioners it made very nice cleaning solvents so it was a very useful family of chemicals that were being made well by the mid-1980s it was recognized that the ozone layer was thinning and there was a formation of this ozone hole over Antarctica so people started to panic because they realized this is a super bad thing to happen and in 1987 a bunch of countries got together and foreign what was called the Montreal Protocol and it's like a treaty among nations and the agreement was everybody we need to stop manufacturing CFCs and the rich countries agreed to go first and this continued CFCs and then poorer countries would discontinue it later on well as they watch the ozone hole grow and grow in the 80s and the 90s they got back together in the 90s a couple more times and signed a couple new treaties to kind of speed this whole process up by 2006 the ozone hole is the largest had ever been and by 2015 finally all of the countries were in on the you know ending the production of CFCs so it took 30 years from the time that they discovered this - when finally everybody stop making CFCs now just because they stopped making them doesn't mean the problems over because a lot of the CFCs in the atmosphere they'll last hundreds or thousands of years and a lot of them haven't even gotten up to the stratosphere yet but after years of decline and this is this is a how much ozone is in that lair the atmosphere so in the 50s and 60s this is kind of how much ozone should be up there and we see the decline start in the 70s and the 80s and right and here is kind of where people were panicking and starting those treaties we see it looks like it kind of bottomed out here in the mid 90s to 2000 technically right there that's the where it was the the biggest that was owned homes the biggest in 2006 but what we see is that very slowly in the last few years the ozone is starting to come back now it's going to take decades maybe 100 years or more for the ozone layer to come back to the layer to the you know amounts that it was previously but because there were these this protocol because there were these treaties because the countries came together and greed this is a worldwide environmental problem and they agreed to sign the treaty and they agreed to stick with it the ozone hole is actually a problem that we have humans have solved I mean it hasn't been has been fixed yet but it's on its way to recovery and this is a model that we're going to talk about when we talked about air pollution and later greenhouse gases is can we get all the countries together to agree to clean up the air in to clean up problems that affect everybody on the planet and not just the country that's making the chemicals so we're going to return to examining these two layers and so far what we've said is that the troposphere is characterized by the fact that it gets cooler with height or as the stratosphere gets warmer with height we also said that the stratosphere has ozone and the troposphere does not now there's also several other very important differences notice what happens with dew point so dew point at the surface was about 40 degrees and then you see it goes down down down down and by the time you get to the stratosphere the dew points like minus 100 so that's super super dry air most of the moisture in the atmosphere is down near the surface okay and in fact if we look at what's happening in the troposphere itself it has almost anything you'd be interested in regarding whether all the clouds are in the tropics here 99% of all the water vapors in the troposphere everything you think of as weather is happening in the troposphere and in fact 75% of all the air molecules in the entire atmosphere are in the troposphere now what's the stratosphere like well some people that have more expendable than income than I do get cellphones and by weather balloons because anybody can buy a weather balloon and they tie their cell phone to the weather balloon and they launch it I think I guess they have some app that just automatically takes pictures and then they use like their find your phone feature to find the phone when it lands somewhere and so here's a picture taken in a hundred thousand feet this is how this is right here where our weather balloon popped this is what it looks like notice that the sky is black you can see the curvature of the earth if you didn't know any better you just think you're in space but this is how little air is actually in the stratosphere by the time you get up there this guy is black from lack of air remember this guy a few years ago he jumped out of a balloon to set a world record and he decided to jump out over New Mexico and when he jumped out he was at 128 thousand feet which is kind of roughly right in the middle of the stratosphere and again in these pictures it looks like he's in space right black sky you see the curvature of the earth looks like he's wearing a spacesuit so even though when you looking at in a textbook they will show that the atmosphere has many layers here's the troposphere here's the stratosphere and then above that something called the mesosphere and above that something kind of thermosphere it looks like the atmosphere is pretty thick but by the time you get up to here where those pictures were taken it's already so little air that the sky is black and like we said 75% of the air is in this troposphere region so the atmosphere is not as thick as his diagrams like this imply most of these layers have very very little hair in them so this brings up another point that we haven't really talked about yet but in a cumulonimbus we've said that you can have an anvil and the anvil itself is made of ice but we haven't really talked about why it is that the anvil grows in the first place like why does it why is it flat on top why doesn't it just keep going up so here's another anvil from space so convection is happening here and then something's causing it to flatten out we said that this is all ice but why is it so flat well the reason it's flat is because the cumulonimbus column is coming up against the tropopause so warm air can convict easily in the troposphere most of the time because it's getting colder with height so warm air can rise through air that's getting colder but up in the stratosphere we have something called a temperature inversion what that means is it's getting warmer with height it's inverted to what you expect you expect the atmosphere normally it gets colder with height the temperature inversion means it's getting warmer with height well you can't make warm air rise through air that's getting warmer so anything that's convecting anything that's rising from the surface gets stuck right here at the tropopause and for our key mule in the mist that means that's the top so warm if the conditions are right and we have unstable air air will convict and it will rise but when it gets to the tropopause it will get stuck and it will spread out right at the tropopause right underneath the stratosphere so the stratosphere really acts like a cap it prevents convection from going any further up now sometimes if the conditions are right you can get temperature inversions and other places than the stratosphere so right here there's a tiny little temperature inversion here's a little temperature inversion and if I'm sending up a little plume of warm air it's gonna get stuck right there okay so this is critical for air pollution so in other words let's imagine that we have I really make another graph like these and our graph looks like this so the weather balloon goes up and it recognizes this kind of pattern so it recognizes the fact that it got colder with height and then he got warmer a little bit and then it got colder with height and right here that's our stratosphere up here right but this right here this thing right here is a temperature inversion so let's imagine that we have a city down here and there's smoke coming out everybody m nee when the smoke will rise cuz it's warm but once it hits that inversion it's going to get stuck and if I have a whole city and a whole bunch of houses and a whole bunch of cars and all the pollution is trapped below this in temperature inversion and as long as this temperature inversion stays there this pollution continues to be trapped below it so sometimes you can see something like this where you have here's rising warm air it's just you know it's a fire and then it hits a temperature inversion and bam the smoke doesn't go above that line here is a really severe temperature inversion where it goes right down to the surface so any pollution that's coming out of anything a car a house and anything is stuck right there along the surface of the ground so what would cause this well one of the things that causes two inversions close to the surface is high pressure so before what we talked about is that height so this is a slide from a previous lecture and we said you have winds aloft that converge and then they go down and all these things happen right well the other thing that we could add to this list from last time is that we can make temperature inversions if you make temperature inversions you can trap pollution down here if you trap pollution down here you might have very poor air quality now one day of this no big deal but you can have high pressure centers that might be parked over an area for a week or maybe two weeks or even more and that starts to make the air quality really poor on the other hand if you have a low pressure it actually cleans the air out so it's like this giant vacuum cleaner in the sky and it lifts up all the air pollution and takes it away so let me show you a couple of pictures that show the effect of one of these temperature inversions so here I am about 30 miles west of Albuquerque I'm about 10,000 feet above the ground and I want you to notice what you can see in other words notice the detail the terrain that you can see in here or in this one right now a high pressure had started building a couple days before I took these pictures and you can see some haze in the distance but then I went back about two weeks later and not high pressure had just stayed there for two weeks and when I went back and I fluid the same spot at the same height and I took another picture in the same spot and notice how it looks now you can barely tell the surface is down there right so definitely you can't see the detail you saw before what we're looking at is air pollution that's stuck below an inversion and you can see from the from the city this is downtown you can see that air pollution down here below trapped below the inversion so sometimes the inversions can be really striking so here's one thing Kazakhstan and you can see right at the top of the inversion and now the super polluted air that's below and they're really clean here that's above so the right there that's the top of the inversion there now when you have a city in a valley you can get inversions and in other ways than the ways that I've just described what happens is a cold air can settle in the bottom of a valley and because it's dense it stays down there and it forms an inversion that can last for weeks and weeks and more locally Salt Lake City has this problem a lot so down there and that hay is a Salt Lake City it sits in this bowl and fills with cold air and they will have weeks of weather just like this so here's another image Salt Lake City you can see the brown above it so there's that inversion the top of the inversions about right there and you see that the tops of the mountains look a lot cleaner up here that's cleaner air so this happens a lot in the in Salt Lake City like weeks and weeks they'll have this kind of air pollution problems so if you go back to the last lecture and look at those pressure maps here's the first one we looked at and we said that this is a big ridge of high pressure not only do we now know that this is sinking air and that we have cloudless skies but if this sits over the western US for days or a couple weeks we also now know that it's going to contribute to poor air quality that is to say that the sinking air is probably creating a temperature inversion in here and because of that these guys may be sitting in in in pretty poor air quality is a lot of air pollution so we're going to go through some of the common air pollutants and the first one is something called particulate matter which we just abbreviate is PM in particulate matter our physical chunks of things in the atmosphere so you can see this stuff so what do you think of a smoke or dust that haze in the background that's p.m. and we break p.m. up into two groups based on the size and this number two and a half and ten refers to how many microns in diameter and a micron is a millionth of a meter and so all we need to know in this class is that they're both microscopic but there's one group that's even tinier than then the other group so it could be things like pollen grains or salt grains or dust grains or bacteria or mold spores all kinds of things could count as PM and a naturally common naturally occurring one is that a pollen and so pollen grains every species of plant has a slightly different pollen grain and if you have allergies then you are allergic to actually the size of the particle it turns out so for example the plants that I'm allergic to have a certain size and they may not be the plants that you're allergic to because you're allergic to a different size so that's why people are allergic to different things it all comes down to that the diameter of the pollen now dust itself can be made of a lot of things and it depends on if you've got inside desk or outside dust and so an interesting experiment was conducted one time there's a museum in Germany and I don't know what they had but they were real it was something very valuable and they didn't want it to get dusty and so they had like double doors and you had to change your clothes and all this stuff and they found out they kept getting dust on the exhibits so they analyzed it on the microscope and they found out that most of the dust was actually dead skin and it turns out we're all shedding skin all the time and if you have a sealed indoor environment and you go up to something and you you do this on the wind seal and you got dust on your finger that's most likely dead skin and that also means that you're constantly breathing in little particles of dead skin from other people because they're floating around in the air now that might gross you out but your body absorbs those skin flakes and it doesn't hurt you that's better for you then outside dust because outside dust is usually a little fragments of rock and those rock fragments are usually not soluble in your body so what happens is you breathe them in and then go into your lungs and they stay there forever now here's something called silica dust so silica is just a it's a group of minerals rocks and minerals and when we have dust like in New Mexico the dust storms the haboobs and all that what you're seeing mostly is silica dust and silica dust has sharp edges so this is bad because you briefed us in it goes into your lungs it never leaves it web does itself into your lungs and every time you breathe it wiggles a little bit and every time it wiggles and makes scar tissue and eventually that can lead to lung cancer this is the same reason that smokers get lung cancer okay same kind of idea now you have in your lungs no matter where you live you also have some of these little you have these little tiny microscopic spheres that are mostly carbon that come from exhaust a lot of it comes from diesel engines especially the older ones but we all have them and if you were to cut a lung open and look at it you would see these tiny little black spheres now they're not black in this image because this is a scanning electron microscope so they look white but if you could see them there are little spheres of mostly carbon surrounded by some sulfur surrounded by some other metals and they're floating around in the atmosphere and in the air in all cities so we all have them and when they do autopsies of people who live in cities their lungs are dirty looking because we breathe so much of this exhaust if patients go into the hospital and they're on a purifier you know air purified air for a couple years their lungs will turn pink so one type of PM that has a long and sordid history is that of asbestos asbestos is a naturally forming mineral this is what it looks like when it comes out of the ground and you can it looks kind of fuzzy here you can peel it into little fibers so if you did so it would kind of look like this and those fibers have some really unique properties and that for one thing they're fireproof and you can sew them into different products and so starting in the 1800's they started to sew asbestos into fireproof cloth or fireproof blankets and then eventually they started putting it in into your house so they start using it as insulation your attic fireproof and in your walls fireproof and all kinds of different products now today there's asbestos in your house but it's embedded in products it's not freely just out in your your attic like it used to be and the reason for that is because asbestos is very hazardous to breathe and so under a microscope this is a scanning electron microscope it's asbestos is a bunch of tiny little needles and when you breathe them in they you know these are microscopic you can't even see them you breathe the man they go into your lungs they puncture your lung and they embed themselves in there and they never leave so your body cannot dissolve them and so over time what happens is as you breathe in and out the little fibers wiggle and create scar tissue and that's what's shown here in the red and eventually this will lead to lung cancer and some other lung related diseases that are due to breathing in asbestos fibers so we have a story in this country about a town in Montana Libby Montana that was formed for the purpose of mining asbestos and asbestos was mined in great volumes out of Libby we don't really have any pictures not great pictures of the mine back in the day but this is sort of the modern equivalent this is a bestest mine in Canada there's big trucks down there for scale so it's a what we call big pit mine so they had something similar to this in Montana and back then they didn't think it was dangerous and so all this asbestos dust would go up in the air every single day and coat the entire town so here's a picture from the 50s and this white material you see is asbestos dust you know the workers would come home they have asbestos on their clothes and they brush it off and it's all in the house and everybody's breathing it and as a result hundreds of people just in that town died from asbestos related lung disease and so there's a whole bunch of books that have been written this is just one of them that's recently been published that detail this this whole asbestos problem from Libby Montana thousands of people have serious chronic health problems because of this they think as many as 50 million you know us homes have products from Libby Montana in them so it would take a long time to go over the entire history of everything that's happened regarding asbestos bill I'm gonna hit a few of the high points here because the story of asbestos gets repeated for other things in our country later on so early eighteen we get the first US patent for asbestos and a company by the name of Johns Manville is formed and Johns Manville still around today they make insulation for your house and by the late 18-hundreds were mining lots of asbestos in this country and making things out of it by 1906 there's a doctor who starts to notice that anybody that works with asbestos seems to die early died prematurely and he publishes a paper about this and more studies are done and by 1918 insurance companies recognize this is a real threat and they're refusing to sell health insurance to people that work with asbestos and by 1922 the US Navy recognizes that it's hazardous requires people to wear respirators ok so we can establish that by the early 1900's it's already known that asbestos is hazardous to human health ok but we continue to mine in this country and so as time goes on there's more and more studies about workers that fall ill due to asbestos and let's see we get to the 1930s some other countries start to pass rate laws regulating asbestos use not in this country in 1936 johns manville that's the company that's mining this stuff higher is an independent group to do research to see you know is this really hazardous material and these independent group of scientists study and they come back and they say yeah it's really hazardous and so the executives decide to suppress those studies so they aren't released and then like a similar incident happens a few years later we're where another group studies the effect of asbestos on mice and they found on 80% of the mice inhaled asbestos get cancer that research also not published case so we're gonna see this is also going to be a common theme we're gonna see in this class on some other topics and let's see we've got more studies come out here's one of note in 1960 that they realized that not just the people that work with asbestos but their family members were getting sick other children were getting our residents in the town that you know didn't have anybody in the immediate family that even worked with asbestos we're getting sick so they realize it's a much broader problem and finally when we get to the early 70s it's finally listed it listed in this country as a hazardous air pollutant and this is the first time in this country we finally recognize that there's something wrong with asbestos India shouldn't breathe it realize that this is coming like 60 years after the first papers were published in them in the medical science so from then from that point forward Congress has tried to pass more legislation to try to restrict how much asbestos one can can breathe and be exposed to and so let's see there's a bunch of several things here but as time goes on there are more and more laws being passed regulating the the use in the the mining of asbestos now in 1991 a bunch of manufacturers of asbestos got together and challenged the EPA the Environmental Protection Agency in court and they got them throw out some of the rules regarding asbestos okay so the companies that are mining this stuff are are fighting against these regulations so as time goes by though eventually the regulations win in 2002 we finally stop mining asbestos in California now we're about a hundred years past when the the first studies were shown that it's a very dangerous thing to breathe and I kind of skip a bunch of these but in 2010 there was a study that that said that between in a 10-year period between 2000 and 2010 forty three thousand four hundred sixty four Americans died from diseases related to the inhalation of asbestos okay just in that ten years so these are people that had been exposed like in the past and that's finally catching up to them by 2013 fifty countries have banned asbestos but us is not one of them and this reveals kind of a problem in our political system which is that the asbestos industry has a lot of lobbyists they put a lot of money into the political system to fight some of these regulations and we've seen the effect of this finally if we jump ahead so as the years go by we're mining less and less asbestos in this country per year so the latest number I can find 2015 about 360 tons of asbestos in the United States each year it's not zero but point is this is a material that was deemed hazardous early 1900s and over a hundred years later there are still people being exposed to it and a big reason for that is lobbyist money big money gets into the government you can affect politicians votes and keep things legal that are actually hazardous to health so this isn't to say that other countries are doing a better job necessarily so here's a modern asbestos mine in China all that white material you see there that's all asbestos fibers and in fact here's some asbestos mining in India these guys just wear a scarf around their mouth that's their respirator or like this guy he's got a handkerchief I have no idea how many fibers they're breathing in but I don't know how you know we don't know how long these guys are going to live but they're currently being exposed so as a side note the fact that we have millions of buildings in this country with asbestos in them sparked a new industry called the asbestos abatement industry which is that a company will go into a building usually it's a private building like a school or a hospital something like that and they will pull all the asbestos out of all the places that it was originally put in you know as insulation and it's a very expensive process so here what they're doing is they're pulling out the asbestos that used to be up here in these joists and you know all dressed up in their bunny suits and etc and what's in these bags are these easy the asbestos fibers that they're removing well one of the problems of doing this is that once the asbestos is in the building and behind the walls and nobody's messing with it it's really not that bad but when you go and you start digging it out you raise all kinds of asbestos fibers again and it's been shown that asbestos abatement probably just makes the problem worse it's not really necessary and the act of going in there and doing that raises a lot of asbestos dust so some people have argued that this is totally unnecessary but now this is an industry that has a lot of money behind it and it keeps on going so we're going to look at p.m. on earth little Schoolnet and the way I do that is I click the word earth and I click on particulates and this is going to show me a lot of the PM that's in the air today and I can look around and I can see that there's some swirls of particulate matter across the United States I can look around the world and there's a bunch usually in China which we're kind of seeing here they've got a lot of you know a lot of smoke but notice what's happening over here and so this is Africa and in the northern part of Africa there's this huge plume of PM and if you can notice this but the wind well you can't see it so much today but the wind is blowing it off the continent and it's headed across the ocean you also see it over here in the Middle East so normally on a normal day the most PM you will see on earth is here northern Africa in the Middle East now why is that so this is actually naturally occurring for the most part North Africa is very dry and when so this is the Sahara Desert and wind blows dust off the continent into these big plumes that go across the ocean so these winds are called the easterlies they're bringing dust across the ocean and it'll actually land over here in South America now this is important because South America right here this is the Amazon rainforest right and so one of the problems with rain forests is because they rain so much there's almost no soil the soil dissolves away from all the rain it's really hard to maintain soil what you need to maintain rain forests in a place where it rains a lot well here what's happening is very slowly over time dust is blown off the continent from Africa it travels all the way across the ocean and it falls out over South America and very slowly adds to the floor of the rain forests so in a way the dust from Africa is fertilizing the rain forests of South America so that's p.m. now we can also break it down further and we can look at say p.m. two and a half and we can see a few more details you can you can see particulates coming from different sources some of these are fires some of these are cities with there's a lot of smoke that's probably Mexico City right there if you go to say South America we see these spots those are probably all fires in Central Africa so there's the the Sahara dust but we see a lot of dust from fires from slash-and-burn practices that we'll talk about more in a second and look at India and look at China a lot of air pollution in the particulates here and most of that is just industrial you know people burning things that's what most of that is so the next flute and on our list is VOCs which stands for volatile organic compound now volatile in this case means it evaporates fairly easily organic doesn't mean it comes from whole foods it means that it's made of carbon and that's just a different use of the word organic compound it has several atoms in it now it turns out that our nose and brain are set up that we can smell most VOCs here's an example acetone so acetone there this is what the chemical structure looks like there is your carbon so that's why it's called organic and ladies you know this as fingernail polish remover you know when as soon as you remove the lid super stinky right that's a vo see things like gasoline paint those are all VOCs and usually you can smell them quite easily now most of the VOCs that we have in the air here in New Mexico come from the gas and oil fields so a lot of times what happens is that we royal forms it rises to these natural pockets in the crust so this is called an anticline now the gas will often accumulate at the top of the pocket and the oil is a little bit below that so if they're drilling they might be drilling to get the gas on purpose and sometimes when that happens some of it gets out and gets into the atmosphere sometimes they're after the oil and the gases are just kind of in the way either way a lot of times the gas leaks out and gets into the atmosphere so here's a pumpjack so it's job is to pump petroleum which is a liquid but if you've been by one of these there's an odor in the air and a lot of what you're smelling or VOCs there's natural gas coming out of this well a little bit here's a natural gas well so they've dug a hole and they basically did is put in a valve and natural gas comes out of this pipe and then it goes on to a processing plant but there's also natural gas kind of seeping out of the ground around where this well was built now once natural gas comes out of the ground they can't just directly sell it to you for your gas stove they've got a it's got to go through a few steps it's got to be purified and clean separate it out into different components sometimes and then they got to compress it and they push it down a pipe so maybe there's a gas what you know one of these over like Carlsbad and then the way it gets to Albuquerque is there's an underground pipe that takes it all the way from Carlsbad to Albuquerque and so a gas plant is kind of the first stage in that where they separate out the different components and purify it and then in order to get it all the way to Albuquerque down the pipe they've got to compress it in several different places along the way those are called gas compressor stations and each one of these a little bit is lost in in the atmosphere and in the gas plants and the gas compressor stations and then a lot of times again if they're after oil and they don't want the gas they still have to do something with it so a lot of times they'll just burn it that's called flaring so what's happening here is they're trying to get petroleum but they also got some gas that came out with it but it's not worth the effort and the money to try to you know compress it and clean it all that so they just rather burn it so that also emits some VOCs into the atmosphere also some PM there's a lot of PM in in in these black clouds here then another source of vo C is the refinery so refineries are where we take petroleum and we basically put it under vessels of pressure and heat and we separate out we're all petroleum oil crude oil into the different components so gasoline diesel kerosene all those things come from crude petroleum but they have to be processed in a refinery to make those products and so in that process a lot of VOCs are emitted to the atmosphere and in New Mexico we have a couple refineries one you may have been exposed to is in Artesia if you've ever been through the town of Artesia it has a particular odor and what you're smelling or VOCs and they're coming from this refinery so the Navajo refinery is official name of this and it's right in the middle of town you drive right by it and you can smell it those are VOCs moving on to our next pollutant is sulfur dioxide and sulfur is in a lot of fossil fuels so when you burn fossil fuels so2 is a common byproduct he burned coal you burn gasoline you burn diesel you produce sulfur now one of the problems is that sulfur by itself isn't quite that harmful but once it gets into the atmosphere you know combined with water molecules and form sulfuric acid that sulfuric acid that's floating around in the atmosphere then condenses to form rain and you get Sidda crane so here is some clouds that are forming here's a plume of sulfur dioxide that's actually forming clouds that are acidic so these so we know that cumulus clouds don't rain but if they were to produce rain you get very acidic rain coming out of these clouds now acid rain used to be a really big deal and today our big environmental problem is global warming in the 80s it was the ozone hole you go back 100 years it was acid rain acid rain stresses vegetation so the branch on the Left has been exposed to acidic rain and you can see it's not not doing so well in fact when in in the late 1800s people started burning lots of coal in steam engines and then eventually people started produce electricity there's a lot of coal being burned and producing a lot of sulfur it went out into the atmosphere made a lot of acid rain and there are entire swaths of forests in Europe that were killed because of acid rain and you can still see them today they're starting to come back but there are places where there's just millions of acres of dead trees from acid rain and most of this occurred in the late 1800s Early 1900s another thing that happens is that acid rain reacts with limestone and marble and dissolves it so here's a marble statue that was carved in 1702 and 1908 this is what it looks like so it's been around 200 years at this point 1968 notice that it looks like someone just took an eraser to it and acid rain basically dissolved away this statue and we've lost a lot of statues worldwide to acidic rain here's another example this is something called an obelisk it's made out of limestone and it's from Egypt and it was carved out of limestone about 3,000 years ago and you can see the hieroglyphics in this old picture this is what it looked like in 1884 there was a point in history where it was okay for cities just go to Egypt and take things and so New York City just decided hey that would be cool to have that in Central Park so they took it and they put it in Central Park and you'll notice that a lot of the hieroglyphics are not recognizable anymore in fact this is what it looks like up close it has this kind of pockmarked texture acid rain dissolved away a lot of the hieroglyphics in that 3000 year old obelisk and it just happened within like you know a hundred years so we're going to return now to earth nil Schoolnet and we're gonna look for sulfur so I click the word earth in under mode I'm going to chem and then under overlay at so2 okay so now the colors represent sulfur dioxide emissions and if i zoom in here across the US I can see a whole bunch of little red dots with tails every one of those is a coal-fired power plant including some here in New Mexico so coal has sulfur in it and in this country coal-fired power plants are required to remove at least some of the sulfur out of the the exhaust but some of it still gets into the atmosphere and that's what all these red dots are so in the eastern part of the country there's a whole lot more Coal Fired power plants than there are in the West so we see a lot more sulfur emissions out there but let's look around the world here how much happening in Africa but oh boy look at China so China has a lot of coal-fired power plants and they don't have the emission regulations that we do so they emit a lot more sulfur than we do and you can see on here there's just a bright purple blob you know India's got a fair amount - right but China really has most of the sulfur emissions right now also you might notice let's see if we can find it here's some see these stripes like that stripe right there it goes across the ocean here's another one that's stripe do you know why there might be stripes of sulfur out in the ocean so those stripes of sulfur dioxide that are out in the ocean those are shipping lanes and out in the ocean there are these giant container ships just about anything you've ever bought has been on a container ship at some point in its life and these things are out in the ocean they're enormous they have giant engines and they burn really cheap fuel that has a lot of sulfur in it the reason they can get away with this is because out in the open ocean there's no pollution laws when you're 200 nautical miles from the shoreline then the the country in question there air pollution laws apply but on the rest of the ocean there's no loss and so these big container ships really pollute and put it in perspective 15 of these big container ships produced as much so2 as all of the cars in the world combined okay and then figure well there's 6,000 of those giant container ships out in the ocean right now and 85,000 commercial ships that are currently in use so there's a lot of air pollution out in the ocean from these giant ships next one on our list is oxides of nitrogen which we abbreviate as knocks knocks are two different molecules n o and no2 you get them when you burn fuel at high temperatures so for example a car engine burns gasoline at pretty high temperature it produces NOx and when you if you live in an area where you have to get your car emissions tested NOx is one of the things that they're testing for well one of the problems with NOx is that it combines with atmospheric water vapor to produce an acid in the similar way that sulfur does except instead of sulfuric acid it produces something called nitric acid and this also contributes to acid rain ozone so we've talked about ozone in the stratosphere and we say this is wonderful marvelous thing that protects us down here from UV gotta have it however there's a second source of ozone that's not natural it's down here at the surface and it's really really bad for you pure oxygen o2 is an oxidizing compound o 3 is an especially oxidizing compound if you breathe in o 3 it attacks all the tissues in your body and it's a major lung irritant and the way you get ozone at the surface is if you have VOCs + NOx in the presence of sunlight those three things will react for to produce ozone so some big cities especially those that have you know temperature inversions like we've been talking about they'll issue ozone warnings and basically don't go outside because the ozone is so bad now in Albuquerque we don't really have that problem here we don't have enough air pollution that ozone really ever becomes an issue but some cities everyday there's some sort of ozone reading or ozone warning that gets a community communicated to the public carbon monoxide next on our list carbon monoxide is sometimes often confused with co2 okay CO vs. co2 two different things carbon monoxide like almost everything we've been talking about here is a product of burning feel so carbon monoxide you can't see it you can't smell it but it's poisonous and what happens is normally when you breathe in oxygen oxygen goes into your bloodstream it finds a red blood cell it attaches to a certain place in the red blood cell there's some electrons exchanged and then it leaves as a carbon dioxide okay carbon monoxide comes in finds that spot on your red blood cell attaches itself and stays there and so that red blood cell no longer can operate as a red blood cell and so as you breathe in carbon monoxide what happens is all the receptors in your red blood cells become choked with these carbon monoxide molecules now your experience is you start to get sleepy right so what's happening is you're slowly become becoming suffocated and eventually is also sleepy able to take a nap and you never wake up that's carbon monoxide poisoning so people that commit suicide by breathing car exhaust in the garage what's actually killing them is the carbon monoxide okay it's coming out of all car exhaust so we're going to go to earth Donnell Schoolnet and look at some carbon monoxide so mode is still kim overlay I'm changing the co and now the bright spots are plumes of carbon monoxide it looks like here we maybe got some fires that's probably just automobile exhaust from New York City automobile exhaust from LA Chicago let's look down here okay so here we are in South America and there's this cluster of these plumes of carbon monoxide every one of those dots and these are fires and these are fires started by humans because what we're looking at is what we call slash and burn agriculture so Americans like hamburgers hamburgers come from cows and if you want to grow cows in another country you can't do it in rainforests so cows like grass so what they do is they chop down the rainforests and they burn it and then they grow grass but as we said a few minutes ago there's not much soil in the rainforest so grass doesn't last very long so you get a couple seasons of grass out of it and then the cows need to move on so you got to chop more rainforests down and repeat the process so this is all agriculture practices here mostly it's a grow cattle to sell to us in fact if we look over here in Africa okay we got some more over here so each one of these little spots is a place where those it's a fire do the slash and burn for the most part so let's see here there's India Oh China he never failed disappoint so a lot of carbon monoxide emissions from China today so again that's you know mostly it's all from burning fuel so whether that's coal-fired power plants or automobiles or factories or something that's what's causing it so it looks like today the world record holder for C Co emissions is China once again so next up on our list of air pollutants are the heavy metals lead which is pretty soft and mercury which is liquid at room temperature it may not make sense that you could have heavy metals in the air but there's a couple ways that could happen with lead he used to be that lead was in gasoline and they put it in gasoline because it was a cheap way of raising the octane level and so for 75 years or so we burned lead gasoline in our cars and all that lead went out into the atmosphere so much so that there's really almost no place you can go on earth now and not find lead in the soil so in the 80s we started to phase out leaded gasoline so for a while you could buy regular gas which meant it had lead in it and then the unleaded and then about a decade after that they got rid of the leaded gasoline altogether and your only choice now is unleaded at least for cars in this country what also was in all paint it forms compounds they're very colorful so they used to use lead to make the pigment and so what would happen is they would paint a house with lead-based paint and then the paint would chip off over time and flutter away into the wind and you could get led into the atmosphere that way so and the recent year or so Flint Michigan has been in the news about the lead in their water but there's actually a lot of places that have led problems and this map you can explore if you want and you can find where you live and it'll tell you how much lead is in the environment if you zoom zoom in on Albuquerque you see there's a lot of red zones here around Albuquerque and these are neighborhoods most of these are neighborhoods that were built with lead-based paint including the house that this is being recorded in so this has led all over the environments in the water in the paint in the soil whatever right now we're talking about lead as an air pollutant only now mercury can also get into the air because it's naturally occurring in coal so here's a coal-fired power plant there's a big pile of coal there they're going to burn and in an earlier lecture we talked about how water vapor condenses out to make a little cloud that's from burning hydrocarbons in the coal but what's also coming out of the chimney is mercury and so every coal-fired power plant is putting a little bit of mercury into the atmosphere now mercury ends up in the ecosystem and can get concentrated in certain organisms like fish so somehow or another the biology of fish is such that mercury gets concentrated in fish tissues and there's places where the fish have so much mercury that you can't eat the fish so mercury is a neurotoxin it causes brain cancer among other things and so if you eat fish it's wise to pick fish that don't eat other fish okay so for example a big fish that are predators that eat other fish they end up with more mercury in their bodies it gets concentrated in their bodies you're healthier fish are the ones that don't eat other fish but maybe eat insects or something like that so your salmon steelhead etc those are healthier fish this is especially true if you're pregnant so if you think you're pregnant don't eat tuna okay because tuna has measure amounts of mercury in it so a lot of people may not realize this but a lot of the big American cities went through a period of time where the air pollution got so bad that they're almost uninhabitable and these pictures are from the 40s 50s and 60s of some cities like Los Angeles in San Francisco New York and what looks like fog is actually air pollution and it became really unpleasant to live there you know everybody's eyes are burning you couldn't see the buildings it was really not pleasant to be outside and so finally Congress decides to do something about it starting in the 50s and it starts out with something called the air pollution control act and it really didn't do much by today's standards it gave the Surgeon General permission to distribute information about air pollution like that's a big nothing but baby steps okay and then 1963 they established something called the clean air act and this is going to at first doesn't have any teeth really but it's going to grow in later years and at first all it does is it establishes a federal program to study air pollution but so far people can still pollute as much as they want in fact here's a picture from 1970 this is a battery processing plant big plumes of black acrid smoke going out in the atmosphere completely legal there's no laws regarding air pollution at that point now in the 1960s there's there's going to be some laws that start to come into effect regarding air pollution with cars so the first amendment to the Clean Air Act occurs in 1965 called the motor vehicle Air Pollution Control Act and what it said is that cars that are going to start being built in 1968 have to be cleaner than the previous models that compared to a 1963 car have to emit 72 percent less VOCs and 56 percent less carbon monoxide okay so that's the very first time there's a law regarding air pollution with cars so prior to 1968 cars could put as much as they wanted there was no laws regarding that well a lot of things are happening in the late sixties early seventies regarding air pollution in fact regarding pollution in general there is this sort of environmental movement afoot and people were protest thing about the quality the poor quality of the air so here's some photos from from those times and there's a bunch of Luther laws or kind of being passed but in 1970 the established Environmental Protection Agency so this is an agency that's designed to be in charge of all these environmental problems ok so prior to 1970 there are a bunch of the laws some regarding air some with water or some with wildlife and they were taken up by different agencies and and the EPA was supposed to head all of those things okay consolidate all those different laws so that happens in 1970 then the same year there are amendments to that Clean Air Act the one that they started in 1963 and this is where they introduced the list of pollutants that we've been talking about p.m. VOCs so2 these are things that now can be regulated for the first time ever all right and this law becomes amended in the future so there's amendments in 1977 those amendments in 1990 and what happens throughout time is that more and more air pollutants are added to the list so we went over some one that the big ones right so2 carbon monoxide those things as time has gone on more pollutants have been added to the list and more regulations about how much you're allowed to emit into the atmosphere well as a result of this so here's a graph starts in 1980 goes to the year 2013 and it's got a bunch of things on here but this Green Line is the the big pollutants that we've talked about okay VOCs p.m. all those things they've gone down since 1980 to 2013 by 62% so there's 62% less of those emissions going into the air compared to 1980 during that same time we have more people we have more cars we're traveling more miles we're using more electricity so even though there's more of us driving more owning more cars the amount of actual air pollution has been going down and this is because of the Clean Air Act another way you can measure this are in the amount of smoggy days so this is in the Bay Area so near San Francisco and they were keeping track of how many days of really hazardous smog that they had so this is 1969 and you can see they've gotten you know someone who looks like about 65 days of really extreme smog and over time you know there's good years and bad years but they start to hit days with zero days of really intense smog and again this is due to the Clean Air Act there's more people there today there's more cars there today that their air is actually been getting cleaner and you can see photographs of this this is LA 1968 versus LA 2005 right so the Clean Air Act and these these rules actually had a big impact cars have been getting cleaner and cleaner every year so every couple years manufacturers have been required to produce automobiles that pollute less and less you may not know this but there are machines that will be set up on the side of the road that will measure the pollution of your car we don't really use them so much in New Mexico but they do this in California and this is data from Phoenix so what they're looking for is their so car drives by and it's measuring the pollution of the car that just drove by right that's what it's measuring so it's measuring vo C and NOx and there's three different kinds of cars here SUV's pickups small cars or sorry small pickups and then just cars and what you notice from 1981 to 1999 that the amount of VOCs are going down in the amount of NOx going down okay and so that again that's due the regulation from the Clean Air Act manufacturers are required to meet these certain standards for air pollution so without making things political we have to talk about making things political because we're in a very weird time and I don't know when you're going to watch this but I'm recording this in early 2008 and we've had the Trump administration now for a year and things are changing things are chaotic so without diving too deep into it let's talk about a couple of things if you took this class ten years ago we would talk about the Clean Air Act we talked about the rules every year things are getting better every year the air is getting cleaner right but now everything's in flux and so one of the things that's happened is a Trump has appointed Scott Pruett in charge of the EPA well Scott Pruett is has nothing to do with the environment in fact his background is that he was a lawyer who is suing the EPA prior prior to this on behalf of oil and gas companies so his big thing is he would like the EPA to go away he was suing kind of like to get rid of these air pollution laws and now he's in charge of it right this is a classic political move if your political party doesn't like a certain agency you take someone else that hates that agency and you put them in charge of it okay so this is not new okay this kind of thing has been going on a long time but one of the things this brings up is well okay so what's going to happen to all these air pollution laws right and the answer is we're not totally sure but about a year ago Trump signs an executive order to quote-unquote initiate a review of the air pollution policies and they have been promising the Trump administration in general has been promising that they're going to remove a lot of these air pollution regulations now as of right now nothing really concrete has been done they've rolled back a few things for coal-fired power plants but they really haven't completely got rid of the laws that we've been talking about for the Clean Air Act but or one year in so I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't want to dwell on this too much except to say times are changing and it's a little ironic that I just showed you pictures of this from the 1960s and now I can show you the same pictures of this from 2017 so people protesting about the exact same thing forty years later well one of the things that came out of the Clean Air Act is something called the AQI and the AQI is the air quality index and what it does is it establishes a monitoring system for air and so we have a machine that collects air it measures the air pollution and then it rates it it's numerical from 0 to 500 and if you're in the 0 to 50 zone that's considered good that's where you want your air most of the time 50 to 100 moderate and so on and so forth all the way to hazardous which is 300 to 500 and they assign a color to this as well well you can go online and you can check the air quality all across the country and here's this website right here we're going to go to this right now so here's what this website looks like and we can visually just kind of look at the quality of the air so we see a lot of green and yellow that's good news and you can zoom in and click on any station to get a reading so if I click on this one Santa Fe Airport okay so it's reporting 34 that's that's good right that's pretty clean air and by and large we're doing pretty well I don't know what's going on here we've got some near the border of 500 that's bad if we go down to Mexico looks like we've got some pretty polluted air down here by Mexico City that's not too surprising and let's go across the world here so over Europe here looks like we got a batch a pretty bad air right in there might be related to a temperature inversion I'm not really sure let's keep going no China does not look good so we got a lot of red and we have a lot of dark red and in fact if you look at these if you can read it says 999 that means that pollution is so bad it's clear the scale so when they invented the AQI scale I only went from 0 to 500 and there are air pollution monitors in China that routinely report air pollution over a thousand in fact the government isn't completely forthcoming with how bad the air quality there is but we have an embassy in China and we have an air monitor on the roof and so we we actually know how bad it is and it's routinely like 1,500 on the AQI scale something like that so in fact China is a pretty interesting study and what happens if you don't have any air quality regulations so this is called a sunny day in China and this is not fog this is air pollution and this is the kind of air when you have an AQI of 999 this is what it looks like okay and it comes in like a fog and it's often this way for weeks at a time in Beijing and people walk around with dust masks on sometimes people exercise out outside with with dust masks on other times a students exercise inside okay these guys going on the marathon with their respirators on these guys are pretty gangster they don't care they're gonna breathe it in anyway this is what a satellite picture of China often looks like all this brown that you see that's all air pollution so it's worth pointing out that the one of the reasons the air pollution is so bad in China is that unlike us they don't have or have not historically had any laws regarding air pollution they've also been growing they've been putting up like several coal fire power plants per week in the last several years but unlike here where we have a lot of fairly strict regulations regarding air pollution they've just pretty much let people do whatever they want and so you can kind of see the result of that system here in fact 2015 they were going to have a parade to celebrate the in a World War two so for a couple weeks leading up to the parade they took cars off the streets they shut down power plans to shut down factories and the day of the parade or the day before the parade I guess it is this is what it looked like this is what Beijing looked like you can actually see the sky literally the day after the parade they are all right back to work everybody this is what it looked like okay so they could have clean air it's it's possible but they're gonna have to invest you know time energy and political will to clean up their air to keep it you know kind of like what we have here so to summarize the atmospheres have divided into layers with the lowest two layers being the troposphere and above that the stratosphere and the stratosphere has a big temperature inversion and that's what blocks convection now high pressure centers can create temperature inversions lower down in the troposphere and if you have one it will prevent things from convecting and going up into the atmosphere and that is what traps air pollution so we went through the different pollutants and we talked about how legally nothing really happened in this country till the 1970s and then we started passing laws regarding air pollution and the only things that are Putin are things that are actually dangerous to us so as we'll talk about in a future lecture greenhouse gases are not part of this list that's a separate thing and up until a year ago with a new administration the story has been that each year that goes by air pollution here in this country gets better and better and the restrictions become tighter and tighter so your cars are cleaner your factories are cleaner etc right now who knows what's going to happen alright thanks for listening you
