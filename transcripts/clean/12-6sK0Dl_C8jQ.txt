[Music] hey this is Mel strong and this lecture is on fronts and mid-latitude cyclones now in previous lectures we've been talking about how we can create clouds and precipitation through convection so in that story we've got a little parcel of air it's warmer than its environment and it wants to rise and as it rises it expands and as it expands it cools and eventually it will reach its dew point and form a cloud if it keeps on going then eventually you can get precipitation ok there's a whole completely different way to make clouds and precipitation and it comes from the collision of these large what we call air masses so here's a map that you often see in our textbook of air masses and what they're trying to show here is that air that sits over a particular region will take on certain characteristics and we talked about this a little bit when we were back talking about humidity that if you had a blob of air sitting over the continent it's probably very dry whereas a blob of air that's sitting over the ocean can pick up a lot of water from evaporation well not only is there that variable but it's also depends on the temperature and where it is so for example up here MP stands for maritime polar this is maritime tropical this is maritime equatorial so these are all blobs of air that are sitting over the ocean but as we learned when we in the lecture on the evaporation if you're sitting over warmer water there's a higher evaporation rate into the air mass so the air mass this air mass is going to have a higher dew point than say this air mass and we have for example CPS continental polar CAS continental Arctic we're not really going to get into the the names too much in this class but the point is is air that's sitting over say this region which is going to be cold and dry may mingle with air that's sitting over this region which is warmer and more humid and when these two things interact with each other you're going to get some very interesting weather as a result now it's a little misleading I think this this diagram because a lot of people might walk away thinking if there is a blob of air sitting over here all the time called Mt from air time tropical but this is just represents sort of average conditions and these air masses are always moving around all the time it's this is just trying to show that air that sits over here typically has certain characteristics that are different than air that say sits over here okay that's all that really means so we're going to start today at Earth will scold net and I'm going to change the overlay to temperature and when I'm looking at right now is surface temperature and I'm doing this on a day that's in the winter in the northern hemisphere so what I see these this blue and purple this is really cold air right here and so we've got cold air that's sitting over the continents looks like right that's kind of what we would expect we got cold air over Siberia and Alaska and notice the pretty sharp change in temperature the contrast in temperature between the air over the continent and the air over the ocean so right now in Northern Hemisphere winter the ocean is much warmer than the continent okay now if we did this in the summer we would see it's probably going to need to be the opposite the continent will be much warmer than the ocean and the reason for this is that the ocean has a very high what we call heat capacity so what that means is it takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of the ocean so it takes a long time for the ocean to warm up and then once it's warm it takes a long time for the ocean to cool down so the oceans temperature is always out of sync with the continents and that's what we're seeing here okay so what I'm going to do though is that so this is all surface temperature and I'm interested in showing you what the temperature is like up in the upper parts of the atmosphere so I'm going to click the word earth and over here where it says height there are these numbers I need 5700 the units are HPA so that's a unit of air pressure and we learned this one back in the lecture on air pressure I only change it to 700 HPA so what that means is if you end up in the in the atmosphere and a balloon till you reached a level where the air pressure was 700 millibars what would the temperature up there be like now how high is that give or take about about ten thousand feet above the ground just kind of think of that right so we're just kind of looking at what the temperature is like 10,000 feet above the ground or so and you'll notice how different the pattern looks compared to what we just saw for one thing we don't see the big contrast between the oceans and the continents anymore and we see that for the most part if i zoom out a little bit if why I kind of look around the middle of the earth I see that the temperatures around here don't change that much and then when you get further to the north of the South you suddenly hit this much colder blob of air up there and it's a pretty sharp contrast so in other words it should not be surprising that the equator is hot and the poles are cold but what you might expect to see is that from the hottest point on earth it gradually gets colder as you move to the north or gets colder with gradually gets colder as you move to the south but what does this showing us is actually this very little change in temperature again remember we're at least 10,000 feet above the ground here or looking at this so there's very little change in temperature and then all of a sudden we hit this boundary as pretty sharp where we go from the warm air to the cold air very abruptly so there's not a gradation okay so that's the first observation second observation is the boundary between the cold air and the warm air is curvy right so if I look at the North Pole I can see it's got these waves in it and I'm gonna turn around and look at the South Pole because there's another one down there it's a little bit easier to see this time of year okay so this boundary between the warm air and the cold air it's called the polar front okay it's always there it's always there in summer in the winter but right now it's there summer down in the southern hemisphere so their pool of cold air is smaller and it's winter up here in the northern hemisphere so our pool of cool there is is larger and if we did this in the summer those two things would be reversed so what I'm gonna do here is let me go back to the southern hemisphere because it's easier to see okay so I'm gonna go forward in time a little bit here so day later one day later one day later one day later each one of these is one day later and you'll notice that this cult this blob of cold air is slowly rotating around the earth so every 24 hours it's changing its shape and there are these you know there's parts that kind of break off a little bit and overall it's still kind of you know keeps this it's staying in the same area but the actual outline of it is changing slowly day to day okay and these waves that we see that are in this blob of cold air are called Roz B waves so you can see especially in the northern hemisphere here I've got these waves okay and let me go back in time a couple of days if I go back in time a day a day you can see these waves are changing their shape okay so the point is we've got this blob of cold air that is slowly moving around the poles of the planet and so the the planets rotating 24 hours a day but and this blob of cold air takes you know ten or so days to make a full revolution all the way around the earth now right here at this boundary between the the warm air and the cold air this is where we're mixing up two completely different kinds of air masses this is cold dry air this is warmer more humid air and that boundary is is what we're talking about today that front where we're calling the polar front where these two air masses meet we're going to get some interesting types of weather now if I find a zone here okay so now I've changed it back to today with winds and I'm looking at out here in the Pacific and I notice for example this spot right here so the winds are spinning counterclockwise right here or in the northern hemisphere so that tells you that I must have a center of low pressure right there okay now if I'm gonna zoom out a little bit here you can kind of make out the fact that we're taking air that's from the north and it's cold and it's coming down and then we're taking air that's warmer and more humid from the south and it's coming up and these two things are mixing up together in this big spiral pattern okay this is what we mean when we talk about air masses colliding we have two very different air masses and this low-pressure center is mixing them up with them up together now I'm going to change this instead of temperature I'm going to change it to look at moisture so tpw means total precipitable water and this just looks at all the water that's in the atmosphere now it's a little bit more evident that we're mixing up different types of air so very cold very dry air coming off the continent warmer more humid air coming from the south and we're mixing these two things together I can turn off the wind here a little bit so you can see that right there we're mixing it up we get a little Center little pressure right there here's another one or mixing up again warm humid air with cold dry air and this is what happens along the polar front we're mixing up two very different air masses and right through here we've got the invasion if you kind of imagine what's happening here I've got cold air coming down invading the warm air and then I've got the warm air coming up and invading the cold air right and so these two things are two different kinds of fronts overall the pole front is the name we gave to those that wavy blob but we can break it down further because here we got cold dry air invading warm human air and then up here we've got warm humid air invading cold dry air so we turn the winds back on here so here's you here's where the cold dry air is invading the warm where they meet and then this is where that warm humid air meets the cold dry air ok so these are going to form two different kinds of fronts so we're going to be looking at what happens where these two different types of air invade each other so the first one we're going to look at is what happens where the warm air invades the cold air so if that happens and we let's say we make a cross-section of the atmosphere so we're looking at it from the side we would expect that the warm air will be coming somewhere from the south in our part of the world so over here is the warm air and it's headed towards the north it's invading okay and to the north we have the cold air that's sitting there so when we talked about convection what we said was if I have a parcel of warm air it will rise because it's warmer than the air around it which is due to density differences now here what we're doing is we're forcing warm air to collide with the cold air but they still have that same density difference the cold air is more dense the warm air is less dense so what happens is if I try to shove warm air in the cold air it's going to want to right up over the cold air and so that's what happens but it kind of forms this very low angle ramp so when the warm air encounters the cold air so so just to be clear this is cold air down here in this wedge the warm air then rises up this ramp it's a very low angle ramp maybe just a degree or two and it goes on for perhaps hundreds of miles okay this is a very large feature well this air as it goes up the ramp is rising and anytime you make air rise it expands and expanding air cools and eventually you'll hit the dew point and then you get a cloud so that's what's going to happen to this Baba warm air that's down here it's going to go up this ramp and as it goes up the ramp it's going to cool more and more so all the way out here at the edge the top of the ramp we would have some very high wispy clouds which we know are Cirrus and then they get a little bit thicker and more of a blanket and that's what we would call zero Stratus and then they get thicker still and that we would call altostratus right and then further back on this wedge we're getting a thicker and thicker chunk of air and eventually they would be so thick that we would not be able to see the cloud sorry wouldn't be able to see the Sun that's Stratus and then from behind that point if it's a well developed this whole thing is pretty well developed we would have precipitation coming out of this and at that point we've got nimbostratus okay now this whole thing not only is the warm air writing up over the cold air but the actual wedge itself is also moving so this everything on this picture the way I've drawn it is moving to our right here okay well this spot right here where the warm air meets the cold air that is called a warm front okay and it's a call to warm front because let's say you're right here and you are gonna experience this whole thing when this ramp gets to you and passes over you the experience is that the temperatures increase because this air back here is warmer than the air that you're currently sitting in so in a warm front the temperatures will increase as it goes by all right so let's think about the series of events that would happen here if you're out here and this warm front is approaching you now to get from from this point to this point might take you know 24 hours could be more could be less well let's just say that you're let's just say this this whole thing takes let's say day and a half okay so you're standing out here and this warm front approaches it's the 1800s and you don't have any electricity there's no weather stations nothing like that and you're on your horse and you look up and you see wispy clouds in the sky okay and then maybe four to six hours later you see cirrostratus remember what that looks like it's ringing around the Sun okay so you went from wispy clouds to ring around the Sun and then if it's still daylight fuzzy Sun and then later no Sun okay so if you notice that pattern cirrus to cirrostratus to also stress to Stratus there's a good chance that it is going to rain in the next say 24 hours so people started to notice this pattern they started to notice that if he saw this and he saw this and you saw this it leads to rain so there is some folklore in certain parts of the world that say that if you see a ring around the Sun it's going to rain this is where it comes from that is true for a warm front okay now as we'll talk about in a little bit warm fronts don't occur everywhere in the world they occur along that polar front that zone between the warm air and the cold air the thing with the rose be waves if you live in that area that's true ring around the Sun often does mean it's going to rain but you can get a ring around the Sun in a lot of different places in the world and not have a warm front so that doesn't totally hold true ok but that's where it ok so this whole thing again in this scenario is moving past you maybe it takes a day and a half or so to get from this point to this point so your experience would be Sara Sara Stratus all the stress Stratus and then rain maybe as much as 24 hours okay now that spot right there is the warm front that that spot we can put that spot on a map so the show a warm front on a map will have a line with these humps ok so this is a warm front and the warm air is back here and the cold air is on the other side okay so the warm air is behind the humps and it's moving in the direction of the humps okay so this is the the the literal point on the ground that we had where the wedge meet the surface in that previous diagram okay so the warm air is coming along it hits this cold air and it ramps up over it so what that means is that right ahead of let's see right here somewhere ahead of this would be our cirrus clouds and then behind that they get thicker and we get the cirrostratus right and then the uncle Stratos and all that but it's a big band it's a big band ahead of this warm front so eventually if you're looking at this from space and we'll see one in a second you'll see the Cirrus as kind of a fuzzy edge and then it gets solid white up until you get to where the warm front passes now a couple other things think about dew point for for a minute the warm air and cold air the warm air has come from the south it probably came from an ocean so the dew points are probably higher and the cold air as we know the dew points are lower so as this warm front passes over you you know if you're if you're out here and you're seeing that sequence of clouds as this thing is approaching you the other thing that changes is when this passes over you your temperatures go up and your dew points will also go up okay so that is a warm front so now let's imagine what happens where the cold air invades the warm air okay same kind of scenario except now what's going to happen is we've got warm air over here and we've got cold air over here but the cold air is now invading the warm air okay so it's coming in colliding with the warm there now the cold air is more dense and it tends to kind of hug the ground so kind of like this so it's it's got like basically tunnel underneath that warm air and it's gonna throw the warm air up out of the way so you got cold air coming down tunneling underneath the warm air shoving it up out of the way and one of the things that you're gonna get right here right where that cold air meets the warm air is very likely cumulonimbus are at least cumuliform clouds so I'll draw some cumulonimbus here so this rolls through shoves warm air up out of the way the warm air rises in these little pockets and gives you a cumulonimbus and then what happens is as this thing passes you know this is pretty cold air and the ground was kind of warm that it rolled over you've got will opens a warm air rising up through the cold air and you will get all kinds of cumulonimbus forming in the back as this cold air rolls through so this point right here that is the cold front and if you were here and a cold front is coming towards you your experience is that you don't really experience until the front hits you and when the front hits you boom you have cumuliform clouds so it could be keenly less could be towering cumulus could be cumulonimbus it could be it could be a line of very severe thunderstorms if you live in certain areas and then as this cold front passes over you this blob of cold air moves past you your temperature suddenly drops okay so that's what we call it a cold front and just to remind you of what we said last time so we've got low dew points here so cold air is always dry air as this rolls past you not only does your temperature drop that very likely the dew point also drops so this is so in a warm front then we've get the stratiform clouds in a cold front we get more cumuliform clouds so on a map the cold front if it's in color is in blue but either way you're looking for a line with triangular teeth and the triangular teeth indicate a cold front air behind the triangular teeth is where the cold air is and on the other side is the warm air and the cold air is moving in the direction that the teeth are pointing okay so that's a cold front and if you can't remember which is which and if it's black and white would I tilt when I teaches the kids I tell them that the cold air is biting cold that's why the cold front has teeth they helped you remember great there is another type of front where the two air masses actually come up against each other but neither one wins it's called a stationary front I'm going to draw that real quick so in a stationary front you've got teeth on one side and then you've got humps on the other side okay so the same rules apply the warmer is behind the humps and the cold air is behind the teeth and at least at this point in time neither one is really taking over the other that's called a stationary front so warm fronts and cold fronts usually occur together near the same place along the polar front and we call it at a mid-latitude cyclone so by mid-latitude cycle and what we mean is not low latitudes like the equator and not really high latitudes like the poles but somewhere in the middle and cyclone is another word for storm so you can think of this as a storm that occurs in the mid-latitudes kind of along the polar front so we're gonna go through the stages of how one of these form and how they evolve and then eventually die so it starts out with essentially a stationary front along the polar front so what we have is we've got cold air to the north so we're you know drawing this from a Northern Hemisphere perspective right so if this is in the southern hemisphere everything would be flipped so we've got the cold air up here we've got the warm air down here and right now neither one is invading the other so we have a stationary front but it won't stay that way for long because you've the cold air side usually has air or winds that are coming down from the east and the warm typically kind of has westerlies so you've got the situation where you have two different kinds of air masses which have different densities going past each other in different directions and that's not a very stable setup and what's going to happen is that there will be waves that develop in this boundary and once we start to develop a wave we start to make a meal add to it cyclone so we'll make a slight wave in that in that front and we're gonna we're going to form a mid-latitude cycle okay so we start to develop a cold front on the west side of it and a warm front on the east side of it and so now we've got kind of this and draw these guys in here we've got a counterclockwise rotation that's starting to set up here and in the center of a counterclockwise rotation in the northern hemisphere is a low so I'm gonna draw it there's a center of low-pressure kind of right between those two fronts now why is the pressure low because air is rising why is there rising well and this one you've got remember the ramp so you've got warm they're ramping up rising up over the cool air in front of it here you've got cold air tunneling underneath the warm air and pushing it up out of the way in both cases air is rising so this whole thing air is rising but the this center of low pressure is right in between it those two types of fronts all right so now what's going to happen is the storm intensifies and this counterclockwise motion is going to continue so you're going to get something that kind of has this shape so the cold front is sweeping around and then the warm front it's kind of arching up now think of everything we said earlier about a warm front in a cold front like all the clouds and all that stuff that's happening all the warm front stuff is happening over here all the cold front stuff is happening over here now in our part of the world when one of these forms this whole thing is also moving to the east so you have to imagine as we're drawing this that there's two things happening one is you've got counterclockwise rotation so the Front's themselves are starting to twist around the center of this and the other thing that's happening is this whole business is moving as its twisting okay so that's the motion of a mid-latitude cyclone so as the storm intensifies what happens is the cold front moves faster than the warm front and it catches up to it so it looks something like this and this is a cold front and this is a warm front so now this this cold front has wrapped all the way around and it's caught up to the warm front and it tunnels underneath the warm front and so that gets a special name we put a hump and a tooth on each side and that is called an occluded front ok so again that cold air when it's wrapping around is moving faster than the warm air perhaps around catches up to it tunnels underneath now we got three different fronts here the warm front the cold front and this occluded front which is really two fronts on top of each other now at this point the storm is at its peak energy okay so the storm is the strongest but once the front starts to occlude then it's kind of like this whole thing's zips up and as a zips up it shuts itself off so when the occlusion happens the storm is the strongest we would say it's in its mature state and the end is near okay so also end is near once this happens then it the end is within you know probably a day or two so the steps from initiation to here depends on lots of factors but roughly one of these things lasts five days seven days something like that so it'll form it'll go through these stages then these these two fronts kind of zip together and it shuts itself off and then another one forms okay that's the life of a mid-latitude cycle now what we're going to do is talk about what it would be like to live through a mid-latitude cyclone so let's put put a fairly mature mid-latitude cycle in here let's do it this way okay so there's my warm front and here's my cold front oops changed my color okay now you live here and we're gonna talk about what it would be like if one of these formed and then moved past you over you now as is this happening this thing is rotating counterclockwise this front is going to catch up to that front and this whole thing is on the move but for to simplify things let's just assume that the front state just like they are but this whole thing is going to move as is across and pass over you okay we're going to talk about what you would see what you would notice now as the storm approaches realize that we're gonna see events that are from the warm front first then there's a gap and then events from the cold front next so that's one thing to keep in mind the other thing to keep in mind is that this El the center of low pressure as it moves towards us the distance between us and the El is decreasing so what does that mean that means the air pressure that we experience as this gets closer to us is going down and then at some point that L will pass by and then as it moves on we will get farther from the L and our pressure will go back up okay so there's going to be a change in pressure in addition to all the changes in clouds and everything else here so we're going to kind of write down the list of events so 1800s you're out on a horse you're out here you have no idea what's going on in terms of the weather but this thing is approaching you and so we're gonna think of terms of like what that person would see okay so first thing what are they gonna notice well ahead what's ahead of the warm front the first thing that happens ahead of the warm front are the cirrus clouds right so you see the cirrus clouds and then that transitions to your cirrostratus in your Aldo Stratus then your Stratus okay so we're gonna assume that this is kind of like a pretty big pretty big storm okay so I'm gonna sign some kind of arbitrary x to this but let's just say that this right here is about twelve hours okay so as you're watching this this whole thing is on the march towards you right so then what finally gets to you what comes after Stratus Nimmo Stratus okay so that gets to you next and you're in precipitation now what kind of precipitation is it it's kind of us it's like a slow and steady rain so I'm going right down steady precip no rain or snow could be either how long does it rain so if you're from New Mexico you might want to sit down for this because it's gonna be hard to wrap your mind around you can get 24 hours or more of steady precipitation okay I know that freaks people out but let's just say that in this scenario this person is going to get about 24 hours of constant steady rain it's not a downpour usually it's not like a thunderstorm we're just Marines really hard it's a more of a state slow and steady type of precipitation okay so if you imagine if you can visualize this whole thing traveling okay after 24 hours of precipitation that warm front is now right up to where you are okay but as this has happened there's another thing that to keep in mind it's also been happening ever since step number one which is this low-pressure center has been getting closer to you so the air pressure that you experience down here on the ground is decreasing so during this whole stage I'm going to put number three but it's happened since the very beginning is the air pressure from your perspective oops is decreasing so in old school barometer talk that means that that mercury column is going down so if our farmer in the 1800 has one of those what they would say is that the the barometer is falling okay that refers to that dropping calm and mercury all right so we're down we're now off to a day and a half right 12 hours of changing clouds 24 hours of precipitation that whole time the air pressure has been decreasing the barometers been dropping but now this front is right to your doorstep so what happens well the warm front passes so what's that like temperatures are going to go up so if you think back to the ramp the bottom of the ramp now is is passing over us and we're in the warmer pool of air behind it so our dew points are going to be up to okay now from your perspective it seems like the storm might be over so the storm will say it starts to break up okay so you've been in slow steady rain for 24 hours and now it's you know it's kind of stopping and you got some cracks between the clouds and you're in this warm rather humid air okay so now you have to imagine that this thing has gotten to you and it's past you so that now you're in in this part okay you're in this part of the storm and you've got to gap between when the warm front passes you and the cold front arrives in this sector and so in this sector is probably very little precipitation and might see some Sun right might be you know some strategy mule asur or maybe might almost be completely clear at some point so I'm gonna continue my steps over here so and again we're kind of assuming this is a pretty big slow-moving storm so we'll say half day to 24 hours of a break okay looks like storms over then coming behind all that is the cold front okay now the other thing that's happening too is this low that's been moving is now passed over you and so pretty soon your barometer is gonna start to rise again so the barometer starts to rise so again that mercury column starts going up right so in other words air pressure increases then cold front arrives what's that like well immediate thing that happens temperatures drop and we said that along the boundary here of this cold front that you often get pretty severe cumulonimbus so if I can imagine let's say I'm looking at this on a satellite loop and we'll see this in a second but right behind this cold front I'd have a bunch of cumulonimbus and as time goes on they kind of become less and less frequent usually so what's your experience about it your experience of that is not a slow steady rain but it's raining here and not here it's raining here and not here it's raining here and not here what do we call that and weather speak scattered showers or if it's snowing snow flurries okay either one so when that cold front arrives we're gonna get cumulonimbus so we'll call that scattered showers right and if it's cold enough snow flurries okay so that goes by and now again visualize that this whole thing is moved past you and you're now back here in this sector of the storm well if it's a big one you might get 24 hours or more of this kind of cold and stable air so the scattered showers can continue a day and then the next day they're even fewer and the next day they're even fewer it could be something like that if it's a big storm okay so what happened so if you can't keep track here we had a half day of clouds a day of rain maybe up to a day of a break and then we get a couple days of this cold and stable air with scattered showers okay and then this whole thing now is completely buying you're back here somewhere and what's back here well what's back there is some really cold air that's coming down from the north from Canada let's say and this is very cold and very stable very cold very dry very stable so what kind of weather is that clear skies sunny but cold so kind of our last step here number ten is cold sunny and normally several days of this okay okay that is sort of the experience of someone on the ground who is experiencing a mid-latitude cyclone now if everybody in this class was from New England or from Minnesota or from Norway everybody would understand this because you had experienced that many many times the further south you go the further away you get to the polar front so what happens as say in New Mexico we rarely get all of these steps in fact this is called the Norwegian model the Norwegian model was formed by these guys in Norway who made a bunch of observations of these mid latitude cyclones and notice they formed a pattern what actually happens where we live most of the time and you kind of have to think of okay let's say this is the earth and there's a polar front okay so we're gonna mix up air on the polar front and you're gonna get a cold front and a warm front so maybe at some particular time here's the warm front here's a cold front right something like this and this thing is moving or you know following basically the polar front and twisting and all that but here's the thing where's New Mexico in this picture New Mexico might be like right there so what does that mean that means that we missed the warm front entirely and we get the tail end of the cold front so if you lived in New Mexico a long time you know what this means because it in the winter what do we get cold air and wind and that's pretty much all we get right our winters are pretty dry whereas if we lived further up here in that same storm system they might get you know several feet of snow something like that because they're closer to that polar front they're closer to where those two air masses are getting mixed up we're pretty far from the poor front so we just kind of get the drags right and then if you get further south and they probably drew this too far south because it looks here we'll draw on a fake equator there's my equator okay so when you get down you know pretty much Mexico and anywhere further south they don't know what friends are they never have them so fronts or a mid latitude in higher phenomenon so in the mid latitudes and even sometimes up towards the poles this is where we get fronts down here no fronts know mid-latitude cyclones so we're going to go to this website called NASA worldview and what it is is they've got a couple satellites that sort of travel the world like this so there's always one on the opposite side of the world is the other and as soon as the footage comes in they post it on this site and you can go back in time several years and look at what the earth looked like and these black stripes in the middle you know the earth spins faster along the equator than it does at higher latitudes so the satellites actually miss a little strip right along the equator and so each one of these stripes is another pass as it comes over and they stitch them together here but I can I can look I can zoom in here and here is a classic mid-latitude cyclone now that line right there that is a artifact of them stitching these satellite stripes together because remember they're going around taking one stripe at a time and then they have to stitch them together so there's time that has passed between one side this image in the other so if you notice here's this classic commish ape here's another here's a smaller one so these are both mid-latitude cyclones I don't sue me in a little bit here not that much and the low the center of low pressure would be right there and the let's see here let's go so you see all this wispy stuff that Cirrus okay so someone from the ground that's standing over here this whole thing is spinning counterclockwise and moving to the east that person would be seeing these cirrus first and then this Cirrus get thicker and then after that you can't really tell what kind of cause you've got but you'd go through the sequence we just talked about so there's our there's our Cirrus and then cirrostratus is right behind it also Stratus similar behind it you can't tell from this where the precipitation starts the nimbostratus or you know probably down in this part but you can't really say for sure here so there's all of the stratiform clouds from the warm front and then you'll notice there's a sudden break right in here okay and then you'll see that right there are these spots what are the spots the spots are communal Memphis towers so every one of those spots out in the ocean is a cow towering cumulus Nimbus in fact if i zoom in a little bit these don't show so well you can often see the animals they're kind of fuzzy I'll hear some so like that's an anvil and that's the ice on the anvil kind of floating off so if we kind of look at the big picture there's cold dry air coming down this way mixing it up with warm humid air coming up from the south they're mixing it together right along here that's what's forming the mid-latitude cycle that's the warm front stuff this is the cold front stuff so this is what's happening along the polar front or all around the earth all the time okay here's it so let's check out this other one here okay so again you can see there's the Cirrus right and then they get thicker and then cold airs behind here all those all that spotty stuff those are all cumulonimbus towers right behind there if I were to go to the southern hemisphere let's see here so here's one in the southern hemisphere it's spinning the wrong way right it's going it's spinning it has a clockwise spiral to it everything because of the Coriolis effect everything's backwards down there but they're all around they're all around Antarctica all the times so here's a satellite loop looking at a mid latitude cycle and it's going to form right in here and then we'll see it mature and we'll see it move so we're going to go a one frame at a time here and so right there you can see here comes the cold air coming down from the north there is the warm air moving up from the south and now they're mingling and now we get that classic commish ape that's what mid-latitude cyclones look like when they're mature and the low-pressure is somewhere in here and it wraps around now you can see the spiral that's where the low is you can see the speckles those are the cumulonimbus and this is all the stratiform clouds and you can see it as it spirals it's also moving to the to the east right so it's headed towards the continent and so what what can happen is especially over the ocean the mid-latitude cyclone is conspiring spiral and spiral so if we tried to draw fronts on this it'd be more complicated than the one that i just drew the the fronts would actually wrap all the way around here plus you get some occluded fronts in there so that's what mid-latitude cyclone looks like as it then matures okay and then it goes on to the we were back to where we started also this is what a mid-latitude cyclone looks like in terms of precipitation so we're looking at Doppler radar so all these colors are precipitation and so we don't see clouds here but the low is kind of centered in here this is mostly all warm front stuff so this is that steady rain we were talking about and makes this comma shaped blob of precipitation okay so that's classic mid-latitude cyclone precipitation pattern let's go back to earth thought no school done that again and so last time we were here we were looking at total precipitable water and so this is where we are again and again just making the point that that's the mid-latitude cyclone counterclockwise rotation we're bringing up warm humid air from below from the south or taking cold dry air from the north and we're mixing them together now I'm going to turn this around and look at the southern hemisphere and what I notice is that that's a clockwise spot over there clockwise spiral clockwise spiral these are all mid-latitude cyclones in the southern hemisphere and you can see like this one for example is bringing warm humid air from the north bringing it down and mixing it with cold drier air from the south so this is happening all the time around the Northern Hemisphere and the southern hemisphere we have these mid-latitude cyclones that travel around in a giant circle where the polar front is the thing is during our let me change I'm gonna go back here okay so now I'm looking at temperature 700 millibars again that's the polar front the storms are going to follow the polar front more or less so right now you can see that will turn the wind off you can see that the polar front time right today goes kind of right through the United States so any storms mid-latitude cyclones are going to kind of come through this way right now if we came back in the summer and we looked at it in July we would see that this pool of cold air is much smaller it'll be way up in here so let's do a demo of that real quick so here I've just changed it to look at a day in August and so you can see the pool of cold air around the North Pole ISM much smaller than it was a minute ago so there's the polar front and from our perspective it's all to the north of us sofa mid-latitude cyclone forms it's going to form along this boundary which is further to the north and we are so as far as we're concerned it doesn't exist right so if it doesn't if it doesn't happen to the United States it doesn't exist so in our winter we have mid-latitude cyclones so we say winter storms and then they move further to the north in our summer we don't notice them at all but they are still around and they're not as strong but they are up here to the north so one more thing about build latitude cyclones here I've got a storm that at first looks like a mid-latitude cyclone but when you look at it you realize it's missing that slot of cold air that we saw in the previous images and it doesn't have that characteristic comma-shaped it is more symmetrical so this is a hurricane and hurricanes are structured completely differently than mid-latitude cyclones so what they have in common is that they have Cirrus out on the edges ok that's similar and they spin counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere but they they do their thing completely differently so for one thing mid-latitude cyclone means it's not low latitudes it's not high latitudes it's in the middle hurricanes form at low latitudes ok so there's a there's a they're physically in different places on the earth let's talk about the structure of hurricanes here so here we have a hurricane cross section and you think of hurricanes as these organized bands of cumulonimbus so if this thing were the pass over you you would have a heavy rain from this band of cumulonimbus and then heavy rain from this band of cumulonimbus but in but Queen there's a little breaks I mean you're in a hurricane so break is relevant but it's the precipitation is decreased in between these now that means that air within a hurricane is going up and feeding all of these cumulonimbus towers all that air going up some of it has to come back down and a lot of it comes down through the eye so you may have heard that in the eye of a hurricane you can see the sky which is true because sinking air fights cloud formations so when this comes across you've got relatively low pressure under most of this hurricane and that kind of sucks the sea up a little bit call it a pressure driven surge then there's a bigger effect from the winds that kind of blow the ocean into a pile underneath the hurricane it's called a wind driven surge when this comes ashore this blob of water comes ashore with it and that is kind of what we refer to as the surge and it can flood the coastline now hurricanes form at low latitudes but they actually don't form right at the equator and the reason for that is because you need some Coriolis force for the thing to spin so when we were talking about Coriolis effect we didn't really talk about this I don't think but right on the equator nothing spins okay so storms don't spin at the equator you got to be a little bit north or a little bit south to get the Coriolis effect so hurricanes will spin up kind of right in around through here in our neck of the woods and then once they're formed they may drift further north and in fact they get into the area that we call the mid latitudes right so mid-latitude cyclones are up in here and occasionally a hurricane could go far enough north that it could get into that territory but hurricanes are pretty much forming pretty close to the equator a little bit north and a little bit south in this region that's red this is the area of the ocean that has the highest sea surface temperatures and so higher ocean temperatures mean more evaporation which means more dew point which means the hurricane is easier to form it's easier to form cumulonimbus when you have hot humid air okay so that's everything we're going to say about mid-latitude cyclones this time and next time we're going to get into worldwide atmospheric circulation thanks for watching you
