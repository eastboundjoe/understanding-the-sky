[0:02] a I'm L strong and this lecture is on monsoons and we're going to start out talking about a couple of scenarios that will lead up to monsoons and first I want you to imagine that we've gotten an island sitting out in the ocean and the ocean let's say is 17 degrees now the ocean has a very high heat

[0:33] capacity which means it takes a lot of energy to warm the ocean up and then once the ocean is warm it takes a long time for it to cool back down and and so most places the ocean temperature is pretty much the same day and night it doesn't really change that much so for this scenario the ocean is 70 degrees and it's going to be 70 degrees in the day and also at night but the island has will be a fairly low heat capacity which

[1:04] means that it's temperature is going to dramatically change from day to night so this is the daytime there's the Sun and the Sun comes out and warms the island and let's say he gets up to 80 to 85 okay so the temperature on the island is warmer than that of the surrounding water and the air starts to rise okay the air starts to rise and if we think about what happened when we did this with cumuliform clouds of convection

[1:35] let's say maybe we get some sort of convective cloud above that the air continues to rise then exits the cloud right okay so for today the important point is if you're making air rise off this island there has to be other air that comes and takes its place so there has to be air moving in off the ocean to replace the air that's rising

[2:07] off the island so if you're standing right here in this little picture you would you would feel the sea breeze this wind coming in off the ocean and so you've got one coming in off the ocean it rises the air we exits the cloud and if we could follow it around we would have some kind of convection cell like this okay

[2:37] so during the day we have air moving in off the ocean moving in land and rising above the island okay that's the day now let's say same scenario but it's the night so now let's imagine what happens at night so the Sun has gone down and we'll draw here's the moon let's say and so

[3:09] the water is still 70 but our island because it has a low heat capacity you know it warmed up quickly in the daytime it's going to cool quickly at night and let's say it cools down to 55 okay so now this colder then the surrounding ocean so what would happen is you would have air that's rising on either side of

[3:43] the island and there is air that is replacing the rising air coming off of the island so if you're standing here you feel wind blowing out to sea okay so this might rise and may or may not form a cumuliform cloud but we set up a circulation pattern that's exactly the opposite of what we had in the daytime

[4:14] so in the daytime we had air rising because it was warmer than the air around it at nighttime we have air sinking over the island and air rising on the other side of it so the the circulation exactly flipped okay so let's extend this idea except now what I'm going to do is I'm

[4:45] going to make the ocean and a continent and now that instead of thinking of day versus night let's think about summer versus winter okay so if it is let's say this is a 70 degree ocean and we have a cut let's say it's the winter and the continent is let's say 50 okay and this

[5:18] is day and night they'll be there's going to be a 24-hour cycle of temperature but let's think about a season here during this entire winter season the continent is going to be colder than the ocean so what'll happen is air will rise over the warmer ocean right and then this air over the continent is going to come out to

[5:49] replace the air that's rising so again if you're standing here you've got you experience this breeze coming off the continent so if we could trace this back we would see that there's this breeze coming down off the off the continent out into the ocean and then rising now what is this aerial ear like well the way I've drawn this we've got high elevations up here and we know that

[6:22] higher you go the colder of the air so this is probably pretty dry and cold and as that air comes down the air warms so sinking air warm so this air coming down here hill is warming but it's not getting any more moisture there's no source of moisture so the only thing that's changing as this comes down as the relative humidity is decreasing so

[6:53] you're making the air warmer but the dew point makes the ratio of staying the same so when you come down here you've got low relative humidity dry air okay and when I say warm that's relatively speaking right this could be this could all be really cold air of course we said it's 50 degrees that's not that cold but whatever temperature this is this might be air that's way below freezing and it's coming down the continent and as it comes down at warms doesn't necessarily mean it feels warm

[7:25] to you it's just getting warmer but the point is we've got cold dry air coming down the continent going out to sea okay so this is analogous to what happens in a place like India okay so so my continent here is maybe India and this part up here are the Himalayan mountains so the Himalayan mountains that's that big mountain chain between India and the Tibetan Plateau so think of like Mount

[7:58] Everest right you've got Mount Everest is one mountain in this big chain of really tall mountains you've got a really you've got really tall mountains up here on the way to Pakistan over here and Tibetan Plateau so this then is Indian Ocean and this is what India experiences throughout the winter very dry conditions they've got air sinking down off the Himalayans coming

[8:30] down across the continent out into the ocean where it then meets relatively warm water and rises all right so let's now think about so remember just to make sure it's clear this is the winter okay this is the winter so we're gonna do the same scenario in the summer okay so now I'm gonna draw another one just like this one and will say for the sake of argument

[9:02] that the ocean is still 70 degrees but now it is the summer and the continent warms up more than the ocean so again there's a there's a day/night cycle but overall the continent is staying warmer than the oceans so let's just say for the sake of argument that it's a tea over here okay so now we've got air that's rising above the continent and

[9:35] that is going to pull in air from the ocean now what's the air like that's over the ocean well this is a pretty warm ocean so this is high dewpoint air right so back when we talked about the vaporators you got warm body water you got a lot of evaporation this is very humid air and now you're you're pulling it over the continent where the continent is warmer than the ocean so you're gonna have

[10:05] rising booms of air that lead to thunderstorms and you're going to have them all up and down I'm just drawing this them in one spot but you're gonna have this more and more as you go up the continent so in fact you get all the way up here remember this is the Himalayan mountains up here Mount Everest all that good stuff and as air rises up over

[10:35] those mountains they're gonna make some really extremely convective thunderstorms up here right so as air rises say above the Himalayan mountains that's going to help pull this warm humid air up over the continent so and just to be clear you'd have rising air on all these I'm just trying to point

[11:05] out that you've got this big scale circulation pattern which is that air is being sucked in off the ocean rising up over the Himalayan mountains and rising up another places too but the circulation has reversed so if you're standing here in the scenario the wind has cut is 180 degrees the other direction in the winter it was moving out towards the ocean in the summer it's moving in from the ocean that's a

[11:36] monsoon okay so the monsoon circulation simply means we had a seasonal shift in the wind now because there's an ocean out here and it's pretty warm that seasonal shift in the wind means we have a dry season and then a wet season okay it doesn't have to be that way in fact the very definition of

[12:07] a monsoon is that it's just simply a seasonal reversal in wind direction so bulls one way part of the year and then it blows from another way another part of the year it could and usually does lead to a wet season and dry season now if you're from New Mexico we talked about the monsoon as the wet time in the summer and we'll talk about that in a second but truly the definition of monsoon just means the wind has a reverse direction and it doesn't mean

[12:37] it's reversed for a day or even a week it's a seasonal thing right so it completely reverses for months usually that's what that's what the true monsoon is so here's an example of what India looks like before monsoon and after a monsoon so here's two pictures taken from the same location you can see they stitched them together and you can see that the huge difference in vegetation between the dry period and the wet

[13:08] period a lot of what we know about modern weather was first figured out when people were trying to understand when in why the monsoon in India happens so because it's so dry for so long farmers would like to know exactly when they should plant their crops to take advantage of when all this rain starts so 100 years or so ago people were really interested in trying to figure out the timing of the monsoon and a lot

[13:40] of the things that we've been talking about so far like air pressure and all that stuff was studied intensely to try to figure out how to time them on soon turns out even today you can't really predict it very well so it's it's not something that the actual reversal often just occurs on one date we're just suddenly the whole circulation shifts and it turns out it's not even today we still can't completely predict that so I'm going to return to an animation we saw last time and so we were talking in

[14:13] the last lecture about how this ITCZ corresponds to the to the warmest place on earth so here we are in the first of the year there is India right there there's the Himalayan mountains right there and we have the ITCZ here so I'm going to move this further so in Howard well we're in February right so just to remind you what's happening along the

[14:43] ITCZ you got easterly is coming in in the northern hemisphere you got easter bees coming in from the southern hemisphere they are colliding right it's Intertropical Convergence zone so there's that convergence so right here you can imagine the winds are coming down off of Southeast Asia off of India coming from the northwest moving towards that equator right so I mean so towards the ITCZ so we get in the spring and notice what's happening the ITCZ is

[15:15] creeping towards India and Southeast Asia and then notice right there we're actually coming in over India so from their perspective they went from time where the ITCZ was pretty far away to the ITCZ is actually on top them and then throughout their their summer it kind of lingers over the continent and then fall it leaves again

[15:46] okay so here's a couple graphical illustrations of that so during the winter the ITCZ is down here and if you lived in northern Australia you have a wet season right now because the ITCZ is right above you but if you're in India they have wind's coming mostly out of the north down from the Himalayan mountains and it's super dry by the time summer rolls around the ITCZ

[16:18] is up above India you've got wind coming up from the south a lot of precipitation but now it's left Australia and they're getting wind coming from the south coming from the middle of their continent which is very dry so these two locations have swapped their wet and dry seasons now you can see this if you were to make histograms bar graphs of precipitation so in India so each one of

[16:49] these is a month January February March April cetera and then this is how many millimeters of precipitation they get each month so we're looking at this is one location in India dry dry dry dry and then all of a sudden in June you see that bam huge increase of precipitation that's the arrival of this ITCZ the arrival of the quote-unquote the monsoon and then it tapers down and then disappears by the end of the year

[17:20] Australia East northern part of Australia is exactly the opposite you can see this is their wet season and then it disappears they have a super dry summer and it's their winter because seasons are reversed and then it gets wet again at the end of the year ok so these two are basically opposites of each other and that's because of this moving ITCZ just a reminder why is the ITCZ moving because the seasons are

[17:50] changed so we're heating the northern hemisphere they were heating the southern hemisphere and the ITCZ is following the warmest part of the ocean up and down north and south so this animation shows how the winds reverse in this part of the world and what we're looking at is about 15 years of wind and precipitation data all averaged out so each one of these little arrows shows you the direction of the wind the longer the arrow the faster the wind

[18:21] right that's what the other doing and then you see the precipitation are these colors so if you think okay I'm gonna stand right out here in India there's the winter you can see the wind coming down off the continent and it's dry and boom there is the monsoon the winds reverse wet and it returns back to dry again you can see that band of rain comes down and visits northern Australia and then leaves it so these two locations that we just showed in the

[18:51] previous slide are having you know reversed seasons so when when's what the other ones dry when the other ones dry the other ones wet etcetera so we're going to look at a little video here that's on YouTube that was put together by some NASA scientists and what they've done here is they've been studying the monsoon using a lot of satellite data and I'm mostly you're just gonna let it play I'm gonna interrupt it now and then just to make

[19:21] obnoxious comments so let's start this the monsoon is a seasonal rain and wind pattern that was first described over South Asia you see the clouds blossoming here during the summer part of the monsoon for centuries people have known about it but only recently have we received enough data from satellites to really describe what's going on okay so the first thing is notice that down here there is the date so June 14 2014 and

[19:53] the time so what we're going to be looking at is I mean images are being updated every few minutes and so you'll see the time whizzing by here day after day also just make sure we're clear this is all Doppler radar so this is all precipitation they're showing in the colors what you can see here is moist air that has evaporated from the ocean coming across India and providing rainfall driving the monsoon season the

[20:24] great thing about GPM is that it allows us to see precipitating systems as a whole over land and oceans and then as a transition from one boundary to the next all of this rainfall drives soil moisture over land it's beneficial because it promotes the economic activity that people depend on for example agriculture okay so just in case you didn't catch it this is the soil moisture color scheme over here so they're looking at how the soil moisture

[20:54] is changing throughout the reason rainy season as well it fills the rivers which provides water for human activity and the natural environment as well as transportation if the rivers get too full of course it becomes flooding at first the floods you see here are fairly minor and broad-scale but then they concentrated in a few Wiggly lines which are the river basins for example in central eastern China in mountainous regions

[21:24] when the ground becomes saturated due to heavy rains it can lead to landslides kill thousands of people every year and are primarily triggered by rainfall they are especially common within the Himalayan region each monsoon season one really cool way to look at the monsoon is to do a split screen and look at the summer and the winter at the same time in the summer the wind is blowing onshore bringing the moist rain

[21:54] Laden air into the continent in the winter time it blows off the continent now those winds are basically driven by temperature differences between the ocean and the land and where the land is nice and warm the air expands and it draws in the moist precipitation from the ocean waters but in the winter time it's very cold and you can see that the moisture then it goes from the continent back into the oceans okay so this is what we talked about earlier with the how the witness shift direction what

[22:26] they're showing here are this is temperature so you'll see that as it is it moves from day night day night day night you can see the temp the continent getting warmer and then cooler warmer than cooler and it doesn't also in the winter the difference is on average the continent is still warmer than the ocean and over here on average the continent is colder than the ocean so if you watch these two you can see how yes the continent gets warmer in the day and

[22:56] cools off at night but the difference between the two is how it compares to the ocean so that's what those Fox wedding colors mean over the past 50 years or so satellites have been used to measure precipitation all our earth with that data set we're able to understand that monsoons occur not only in South Asia and India but in other parts of the world as well for example Africa where the temperature gradient is between the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahara Desert the wind blows

[23:26] from the moist Atlantic Ocean on to West Africa providing the moisture for the precipitation some of these westward moving storms provoke hurricanes over the Atlantic that occasionally make it to the US southwestern North America also has a summertime monsoon you see high soil moisture in regions where there's a lot of precipitation in western Mexico later in the season this extends up into the southwestern US and the southern hemisphere has a monsoon as well this occurs in the Northern

[23:58] Hemisphere winter which is a southern hemisphere summer when Australia is warmer than the Ocean to the north having a better understanding of the global water cycle and monitoring changes over time is important for society for our everyday lives and our long-term future so near the end of that video they talked about the monsoon in the southwestern part of the United States and of course that's what we

[24:28] referred to as the monsoon and as far as monsoons go ours is really pretty wimpy and monsoon purists would say that in fact it hardly counts as a monsoon compared to ones like India and Africa but for us it's important because it represents half of our annual rainfall so we're going to talk about that and back when we talked about humidity and dew point we were talking about how the dew point in New Mexico changes a lot

[24:59] depending on the wind direction so if you have wind coming out of the West or the the North you we typically have very low dew points because the air is coming from a pretty cold source whereas if we have winds coming from the East or the South of the southeast we typically have relatively high dew points because it's come somewhere from a pretty warm and source so the big picture about the New Mexican monsoon is that through most

[25:29] of the year our winds are like this they're coming out of the West they are we were in the westerlies and then for July August a little bit September we get a couple months where the winds very weakly kind of reverse and we get a weak easterly or southeasterly or maybe even a southerly flow and that's what triggers our summertime thunderstorms that we call them on soon so to explain why this happens I'm going to go over a

[25:59] new concept that's a that's kind of abstract but we kind of have to cover it to understand the next maps we're gonna see let's imagine that we've got the we're going to cut a cross-section of the atmosphere that those are supposed to be trees and I have a blob of cold air and cold air is pretty dense and right next to it I've got a blob of warm air and warm air if you warm up air it

[26:32] expands so my blog the warm air is more expanded and let's imagine that I was gonna get into a balloon well first of all let's just think about this is even though I've got a ground in trees let's imagine we're at sea level down here what's the air pressure at sea level it's about a thousand thirteen millibars okay so back when we talked about air pressure let's imagine again into a balloon and I got my barometer and I go up and I'm trying to find how high I

[27:03] have to go to get to 700 millibars okay and so let's say I find that spot and it turns out it's about right here okay so go up in the balloon find the 700 millibar level and plot it on a map and I take many balloon rides to find this and when I get to the warm air what I would find is because the cold air is more dense and compacted I get to the 700 millibar level sooner

[27:34] than if I was in a balloon and into the warm air I have to go farther up to get to that 700 millibar level so it might be something like this and we call this height in this case to the 700 millibar level we call this the geo potential height now that's fancier term

[28:05] that we need in this class we can just imagine how high do you have to go to get to a certain pressure level I could make one for a 500 millibars I'd have to go higher up I could make it for whatever level I wanted but in this case I'm going up to 700 millibars point is yeah if I were to do this experiment in a balloon I would have to go further up to get to the 700 millibar because that air is more expanded because it's warmer so we're gonna see this on a map in a second we would call this area up here a

[28:37] high and this area down here a low so like we talked about air pressure you had highs and lows it's similar to that but it's talking about a different thing the surface is high the geopotential height surface is what we call this as high and the height surface is low okay so we got to do this because I want to we're not going too deep here I just want to explain this too so that the

[29:08] next map will make sense so we're going to look at some maps of this what we call the 700 millibars surface and I put these maps on learn they're also on my website and what they've done here is for example this first one february 1st to February 28th so that's looking at every day in the month of February for the last 30 years averaging where that

[29:38] 700 millibars height level is imparting as contours so here for example 31 40 ok so what does that mean so this map and all the ones we're gonna look at are 700 millibar height how far up do you have to go above sea level to get to 700 millibars it doesn't tell you this but the units are in meters so I'd have to go up three thousand one hundred

[30:08] forty meters to get to 700 millibars and if I stayed on this line that's exactly going to be 700 millibars over here the height would be three thousand one hundred and thirty meters 2010 so you can see that the height is going down as these as we move to the north why is that because the air up here is pretty cold so it's compressed air down here is pretty warm so it's expanded so we can put in some highs and lows here just

[30:39] like a pressure map so at the top here the numbers are smaller smaller smaller there's a low I'm gonna fit right there and then here I've got a high right here okay so this low is due the fact that the Arab there's just really cold and compressed this high this kind of loop here is due to one of the subtropical highs and this one is called the Bermuda

[31:09] high which I'm just gonna write down here the Bermuda high and this high pressure system will as we see will change just like that there's one over here the Pacific subtropical high which isn't really showing so much on this map here okay the rules for which direction winds go are the same as they were for air pressure clockwise around a high counterclockwise or on the low in the northern hemisphere okay so here's the

[31:42] high so I've got clockwise around this high parallel to the contours so my wind is like this and then over here it's still in that same general trend and that it's a clockwise sense around the high counterclockwise sense around the the low and if I were to just kind of draw

[32:12] some of these in what I see is basically the winds are going parallel to the contours and time and time again in this part of the country that gets you air that's come and kind of down from the west-northwest direction right so in New Mexico we just think about New Mexico we get wind comes straight out of the West here okay and we've got westerlies in fact the whole country's in westerlies at this point and only down here do we

[32:44] see anything that's kind of easterly's way down in here okay so we can move on to March and it's pretty much exactly the same the whole country is still in the westerlies so I will draw a few arrows here to illustrate but our winds are still coming out of the West so they're cold and they're dry okay so now we're moving on to April here and we can see that we

[33:20] have a high down here that's our Bermuda high we still have a low up in here and we still have there's really nothing much has changed too much yet we still have counterclockwise around the high and everybody is still pretty much in the westerlies including us okay so we are we still have wind coming out of the

[33:50] west all right we get to May okay so same kind of thing we don't really see it down here but the Bermuda high is kind of lingering down here and again for us New Mexico still nothing much has changed except we're starting to see this little dip down here okay so our winds are coming out of the West but they're actually starting to

[34:21] come sort of across this the northern part of the Gulf of California right here and it's possible that we might be picking up some moisture here but if we go further back it's still coming off the cold Pacific Ocean okay so so far nothing much has changed yet we're still in the westerlies and now I'm gonna break it up so the maps we've been seeing so far or once a month I'm gonna

[34:52] break it down into one every two weeks now so this is the first half of June okay here's our Bermuda high it's getting stronger why is it getting stronger same reason the Pacific subtropical high gets stronger in the summer we're heating the northern part of the hemisphere and it's getting stronger and it's growing so here it is here's the high and we are low is off the page here somewhere clockwise around the high okay so I'm gonna go around this way parallel

[35:25] to the contours okay so notice that if I were to kind of draw this out Southeast Texas is starting to to change its wind direction right there moving out of the westerlies we are still coming out of the West but we still have this little dip here where but potentially getting some moisture from Gulf of California here all right boo rest of the country still pretty much in the westerlies okay

[35:57] let's go the last half of June now our Bermuda high is now stronger and so we can see the influence of that here's counterclockwise road rotation clockwise clockwise we have a funny little nose here but it's still clockwise okay notice what's happening so at the end of June if we follow our error trajectory back in time

[36:28] it's possible that some of it could have come from the Gulf of Mexico except I had to travel all the way across Mexico and they come around this way northern Mexico still getting it out of the Pacific but we're starting to see a transition to air that's coming from a different place well if if it had to come all the way across Mexico it probably lost most of its moisture on the way here so it's still not really humid air for the most part and if you

[36:59] know anything about the monsoon you know that in general it starts usually about the first week of July and we're getting really close right we're near the end of June ok so now we're going to move on to beginning of July ok so now here's our high and we've got clockwise rotation around the high and notice what we've

[37:31] got here we've now transitioned so that the wind that's coming into New Mexico if we trace it back has its origins in the Gulf of Mexico and unlike we saw in the previous one it doesn't have to go all the way out to the Pacific and loop back some of it looks like it has a direct route across new across Mexico and right into New Mexico and that is

[38:04] the trigger of our monsoon so we are now out of the westerlies and we're starting to get flow that's maybe southerly flow maybe a little bit of a southeast component remember these are averaged over 30 years so the wind can change day to day a little bit this is what happens when you average over you know a two-week period for 30 years ok so then we get to the end of July and here's our Bermuda high so you notice

[38:34] that the Bermuda high over time has been migrating to the north so that's what the Pacific subtropical high it's migrating to the north it's out its out here so we're not on our map really but that's what's causing this this shift so again we can draw clockwise around the high and it's pretty clear from this now that any wind that's coming this direction has its origins from the Gulf of Mexico

[39:04] right so you've got circulation coming around entering New Mexico straight from the Gulf of Mexico so we've got high dew points now monsoon is in full swing usually okay so and in August is pretty much more the same story here's our high here's our

[39:39] rotation around that high now one thing that's I want you to notice that's different here if I go back to say June do you see how close the contours are to each other remember when we talked about wind and we said that the wind direct the wind speed is proportional to the

[40:10] pressure gradient so the closer these are together the faster the wind goes that was with pressure gradient it's the same thing with this height gradient so if I go to where we are now notice we see almost and there's no contours across the the entire state at all there's a very low height gradient also we could say there's a very low pressure gradient which means that the winds themselves are very very weak okay so

[40:40] even though I'm drawing it in these loops like this it's a very weak wind okay it's a very very weak wind which is one of the things that makes purists say this isn't really a very proper monsoon the winds just kind of I in the moisture kind of trickles upwards towards us but anyway let's keep going so that's beginning of August and now we're getting to the end of August and what's happening now is our high

[41:11] pressure the Bermuda high starting to make its way back to the South okay and our Pacific subtropical high which is out here in the ocean is also starting to make its way back but we're getting that clockwise rotation and so we are still if I kind of draw in some arrows here we're still getting moisture out of the Gulf of Mexico for the most part here then we get to so beginning in

[41:52] September and we're still in it now our monsoon on average typically dies out about the middle of September ok so here we were in the beginning of September here or in the last half of September and so here we've got our high and it's kind of a weird-shaped high but

[42:23] we're getting this and this ok so notice what happened the northern part of New Mexico is now if you follow it around is coming out of the Pacific Ocean maybe the southeast part in New Mexico still getting some from Gulf of Mexico but it's still having to travel quite a ways to get there that's different than just a couple weeks before when we had wind coming across pretty much straight

[42:56] from the Gulf of Mexico here so by that when you start making the transition back to moisture from the Pacific monsoon is over okay and so somewhere about halfway through September we stopped getting those daily thunderstorms I'm gonna say the monsoon is over okay and now when we move on to October so that Bermuda high

[43:32] is now centered again it's marching its way south and it's getting weaker so we have this this and now we're pretty much back into the westerlies okay so in October we're back in the westerlies and then it just goes back to the kind of where we started so here we are late October and we are right back where we were before the monsoon so why do we

[44:06] have them on soon we have a monsoon because this shifting subtropical high migrates north and south with the seasons and it changes the circulation pattern around it so when it gets to about beginning of July this is situated far enough north that we start to get into a little bit of an easterly southeasterly flow and we're out of the westerlies finally and then that allows

[44:36] some cumulonimbus to occur and then a couple months after that it starts migrating its way back down and we go back into the westerlies and we're back to dry air so back when we talked about dewpoint we looked at one of these graphs and this is dew point in Albuquerque at the airport during the monsoon season so there's a blue line and a red line the blue line is the dew point as recorded in 2013 the red line

[45:09] is the average of the dew point in the previous 30 years okay so let's just look at the red line first the red line again for 30 years and what we see so so dewpoint is on the the y-axis so 30 degrees that would be in Fahrenheit and so in June or typically in the westerlies and so we have pretty low dew points and on average it ramps up and ramps up until we get to this 47 degree

[45:42] line this green line right here and the weather service here has kind of picked that line it's kind of arbitrary but the idea is that if we have three days of dew points above 47 degrees three consecutive days then we're going to call that the beginning of the monsoon and if you average the last 30 years that comes out to be this line right here is July 11th so right around JA

[46:13] July 10th or 11th or so is about three days beyond where that red line crosses the Green Line so you'll read about the average date the average start or the New Mexican monsoon is about July 10th or 11th that's where it comes from just averaging 30 years of dew point and then usually our dew point stays above that 47 degree line and then a dips back down so this is September 9th right around there and then it continues to go downhill as we go back into the

[46:45] westerlies okay so that's average right averaged over 30 years it gives you kind of a smooth red line now the blue line is what happens in an actual year in this case this is 2013 and so you see a lot of Wiggles up and down that correlate to wind direction so when it's high that means we had wind coming out of the East higher dew points when it's low that's due wind coming out of the

[47:15] west or north that's low dew points and so you can see that leading up to the actual monsoon the winds are changing direction right so we've got easterlies westerlies easterlies westerlies and finally it kind of gets into the easterlies and stays there for a while within the monsoon our little variations where the winds shift back and forth a little bit but we hit but at least in 2013 we you know for the most part we stayed above that Green

[47:45] Line throughout most of the monsoon season so throughout most of the summer our dew point was hovering you know over 50 degrees or so you see a couple places where dip down a little bit and so we call those monsoon breaks usually their correspondent with times when we have either a high pressure center or the winds come out of the west or the north and we have a lack of cumulonimbus and our dew points go down and then on this particular year it kind of had a crazy end looks like we had a lot of unusually

[48:16] humid air in middle September and finally dies you know somewhere here near you know last half of September well every year is different so here's 2014 we see we had a couple really pretty significant monsoon breaks everywhere you see this referred to this as a monsoon burst which means that we have air with extra water vapor in it and often that leads to more cumulonimbus if we go to sea 2015 here's

[48:52] an interesting one here's 2016 so we had what's called an early start to the monsoon so three days after the Green Line there's one two three monsoon starts and it's before it's before July so if you look at the newspaper headlines back then they were super excited that the monsoon has started early and so we have several days of monsoon activity and then it crashes and we see that the dew point went way down

[49:23] super dry air right dewpoints like 15 degrees that's that's like middle of the winter air and it's stayed low and didn't rebound back to normal until this is what July 21st before we're back to kind of average so we had a really basically got a completely dry month that it rained right in the end of June very beginning of July and then the rest of the July was pretty much dry before we bounce back to normal everyone soon season is different has a

[49:53] unique monsoon break or monsoon burst pattern and it's only by averaging every year over and over and over do you get that kind of smooth red line that shows you what the average dew point was so if we made precipitation histograms kind of like the ones that we saw from India and Australia this is what it looks like so the way you read these is this first bar is January and then it goes through the air and the last bar is December so notice say along the west coast here

[50:25] in Mexico and California you've got wet relatively wet winters dry summers ok so nurse ed wet winter dry summer that's what we call Mediterranean climate we talked about this last time that Pacific subtropical high forms out here it makes it really dry along the coast in the summer and then the the mid-latitude cyclones come through and make it wet in the in the winter we see the range tidal

[50:55] effects over here in Nevada it's pretty much dry all year round so in Las Vegas but notice what happens when you get over here you see a completely different patterns so here in Hermosillo it's super super dry super super dry and then about June July BAM we get a big increase in precipitation and then the tapers off or this one or this one okay those are classic monsoon patterns so

[51:27] here in the states we've got two saan very very dry dry dry dry the driest month in there is June and then BAM the wettest month is July the month after that's where that monsoon circulation starts so we go from the westerlies to the easterlies or the South easterlies and suddenly Tucson gets their monsoon start so monsoon precipitation can be noticed on these histograms with this

[51:58] kind of pattern where it gets super dry and also spike or a said with a circulation suddenly shifted in fact there's this dotted line right here that says 50% so this right through in here that means the area within here gets 50% of their annual precipitation during the monsoon and so what we think of is our monsoon is really a Mexican phenomenon in fact decades ago it was referred to in

[52:30] scientific literature as the Mexican monsoon and later people in the u.s. renamed it they called it the North American monsoon so we kind of stole it from the Mexicans but what do you know so these contours show how much of your annual precipitation comes during the summer so this number you're 60 percent of your annual precipitation falls in the summer 55 percent 50 45 so notice

[53:04] that of all the states in the Union we have the biggest blob of monsuno precipitation meaning that for New Mexico roughly half of our precipitation falls in the summer due to this monsoonal circulation but for the most part it's actually a Mexican phenomenon we just get just the dregs of it up into New Mexico Arizona gets a little bit too

[53:36] you
