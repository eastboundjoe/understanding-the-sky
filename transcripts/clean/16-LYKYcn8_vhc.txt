[0:06] hey this is Mel strong in this lecture is on El Nino and La Nina also known as the El Nino Southern Oscillation or ENSO so we're going to start today looking at Earth nautical net and right now I'm looking at the surface winds and I've got a date a day here in the summer in July and so we can see a couple things here's the big Pacific subtropical high swirling around out in the ocean there's

[0:36] another high over there and these little guys here are tropical storms of some kind maybe they are hurricanes or maybe not not sure and if we look down here we can also see this funny-looking thing here is also another subtropical high it's not very symmetrical it's a weird shape today but ok so what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at sea surface temperature so to do that I click the

[1:07] word earth mode is ocean animate currents overlay SST for sea surface temperature okay so the colors now represent what we call the skin temperature of the ocean so this is the temperature of the ocean water right at the surface and we can actually measure this we've got satellites up that measure this every day and so the colors represent temperatures you might expect and so a couple things we can see for

[1:39] one thing we can see there's a band of pretty warm temperatures not exactly at the equator but kind of around the equator so if I could just kind of zoom out all right so we've got a band of pretty warm temperatures near the equatorial region but it's not very symmetrical okay so for example over here this purple that's even warmer than the red so you've got this pool of really warm water kind of over here in the western part of the Pacific Basin

[2:10] and then there's this weird thing where right at the equator it's actually kind of cooler than the water around it which is maybe not what you would expect now if I look around here let's look at the Pacific Basin so notice that if I were to pick say a certain line of latitude and go straight across stick at this line at latitude right here that over on the eastern side of the Pacific Ocean

[2:41] it's colder than it is on the western side right so you can see this greenish yellow color coming down here whereas if I just pick one line of latitude like that spot right there and go all the way across it's much much warmer on the western side than the eastern side so something is causing the ocean to be asymmetric in terms of temperature that there's something that's dragging colder water down from the north and allowing this warm water

[3:12] to kind of come up from the south okay and if I look at the southern basin I see kind of the same thing I see cooler water that is being pulled up here to the north and I see warmer water over here to the west it's not symmetrical and if I move over to the Atlantic I see something kind of similar I've got cooler water up here or more water down there and up here somewhere

[3:44] again cooler water down there warmer water up here so the ocean basins are not symmetrical in their temperature so the first question is why is that okay why would it be colder over here and warmer over here so the answer is that just a minute ago we saw that there are big clockwise winds out here in the Pacific the Pacific is a subtropical high and then over here in the Atlantic

[4:18] another one big again it's not perfectly shaped on on this particular day and of course they go counterclockwise and the Pacific I'm sorry in the in the southern hemisphere so you've got the subtropical highs that are just spinning around and around and around all day long every day out in the ocean and the wind blows the ocean so the reason we have ocean currents for the most part is wind the reason we have waves is wind

[4:51] is what's pushing the ocean around and so when we look at this temperature so I'll go again ocean currents SST that is the result of the Pacific subtropical high blowing the ocean towards the south blowing this colder water down towards the equator and down here same thing except instead of going clockwise it's going counterclockwise so you've got winds blowing cold water towards the north so

[5:21] one of the things that these subtropical highs do is they help bring cold water from up here down towards the equator and they take warm water from the equator and bring it up towards the poles and they do that in both hemispheres so they help mix up colder and warmer water okay so I've got a little map here of the world and so in general what we would notice is that so

[5:52] before I start this is I kind of sketched in the equator here there's a big loop that's out in the ocean big circulation pattern and it kind of looks like this and down here it looks like this and those loops are being caused by the subtropical highs and in the you know it's swirling the ocean around in the giant circle and that giant circle is called a gyre so the the

[6:26] big circulation pattern that we see in the ocean basins is as big clockwise and then counterclockwise rotation of the ocean caused by the Pacific's or the subtropical highs just spinning and spanning and span okay so that's a primary feature that we see well let's add a few more things to this now what we know is that near the equator we have the ITCZ right if you remember back to that what's happening at the ITCZ we've got easterlies what

[6:58] are they doing they're converging so I'm gonna sketch that in a little bit so all along here I have easterly's that are coming together now remember we said in a past or yeah in the past lecture that the convergence isn't exactly at the equator that it moves around with the seasons okay so I'm drawing this to be along the equator just to show it to make a point here but remember this exact spot changes with the seasons

[7:29] okay so there's our easterly's okay so let's just think about that for a minute if you had wind blowing from from east to west this direction and it's blowing along the top of the ocean what it's going to do is it's going to basically skim the warmest part of the water and push it towards the west so let's imagine like if you're in a swimming

[7:59] pool and you start doing this to the top of the water with your hand you scoot that water along the out of the surface of the pool same things happening here so as a result we end up taking this warm water because this is near the equator so it's going to be some of the warmest water in the ocean at least it should be and we're gonna shove it this direction and what's going to happen is that really warm water pools up over here okay so that's what we're seeing

[8:30] over here so this purple blob this is all really warm water that's kind of been shoved over from the from the east it's blown across the ocean so if I look at my easterlies let's look at my okay so there's my easterlies okay right there so those are winds and the winds are just kind of pushing that warm water

[9:00] across the equal equatorial zone you see they're going and today that's a little curvy there but they're coming this direction and they kind of die out on this particular day but they're they're pooling this really warm water over here but I buy all these island nations go back to this again okay so there it is at purple water that's the warmest part of the ocean there's always a pool of just really warm and may feel like bath water if you got into it okay so I'm

[9:33] going to add that to my drawing and I'm just going to kind of approximate that out in here there's this pool of very warm water right and the boundaries are always changing but it's just kind of over here okay so if you're if you're removing water from this part of the ocean then there has to be some other water that comes up and takes its place

[10:04] okay so that's part of the story here that if I remove the warm water you're gonna have to replace it with something else now the something else happens to coincide with a place where there is this big Bend okay so right here where the where the gyre is making a turn by the continent imagine it's like you're pulling water away from the continent so

[10:35] I'm just going to kind of draw some arrows to show that I'm pulling water away from the continent like this alright so if I'm if I'm moving water across the ocean here and then pulling water away from the continent here we need to produce more water to replace the water that's being pulled away and it turns out the water that that comes in to replace it comes up from near the bottom of the ocean that's called upwelling so all along

[11:06] here all along here and all along here there is water that's coming up from the bottom of the ocean okay I'm gonna draw that in blue I'm gonna call this up Welling so what's the water at the bottom of the ocean like it's very close to the freezing point now because of all the pressure it doesn't actually freeze down there but there's places at the bottom of the ocean that are actually at about zero

[11:37] degrees Celsius or 32 Fahrenheit that's at the freezing point it's just not frozen so that water comes up to the surface and is really really cold so this is also a shock to anybody who has tried to go swimming in Southern California so right so for example la is somewhere kind of like right in here and if I go across and latitude you're somewhere over here on the East Coast right if you went swimming out here it's pretty Pleasant it's nice and warm if

[12:09] you go exact cold the same latitude and come over here and go swimming off the coast of let's say Los Angeles or San Diego you find out it's actually really cold and this shocks tourists because they think about Southern California and sunny and there's surfers and all this and they get out in the ocean like holy crap it's cold because that water was actually just recently at the bottom of the ocean and it's coming up to the surface as is all along this part of South America okay this is all deep cold

[12:41] water coming to the surface okay well it turns out that besides the water being cold it has a lot of nutrients in it things die out in the ocean and as a little things die and they fall down that kind of sets up a food chain when that water comes back up to the surface it's got nutrients in it little microorganisms eat that and bigger things eat the microorganism and so on and so forth and tell you finally you get to fish and so the fish actually

[13:12] most of the fish in the ocean live near the continents in zones with the cold upwelling water the fish like the cold water it has all the things that they want to eat in it and so most of the fish Fisheries in the world are kind of up in here up here and other places were where this happens okay so go back a few thousand years and you've got people that are living all up and down South America okay so you have to imagine in what's now modern-day

[13:44] Chile and Peru people living up and down the coasts now we didn't really talk about this at the time but when we talked about rainshadow the there are the Andes that are right along in here let me just sketch that out real quick so the Andes are mountain chain right through here and they're very you know it's a tall chain of volcanoes and the storms that come in come in this direction so a storm that comes in dumps

[14:17] its rain in the Amazon basin and goes up and up and up and up and up and up and then goes downhill on the other side and this is a very extreme rain shadow okay there's there are areas here it literally has not rained in over ten years okay some of it's called the Atacama Desert you may have heard of that so these early people that lived along the coast here if you want protein you really only have one option and that's to get fish because this so dry is really hard to grow much of anything so fishing became a livelihood for all

[14:50] the people that lived here and they kept records so for those people that lived along this west coast of South America you had to make your living as a fisherman okay that was just the way it was well they noticed once in a while they would go out in their boats and this would happen maybe kind of around Christmastime near the end of the year and they would go out and they would notice that actually this zone right in here the water was unusually warm right

[15:24] through here and they would notice the fish were gone and this was a disaster because they depended on the fish and the fish wanted the cold water in the cold water had disappeared and they didn't know what causes this but they all they seemed to notice that this often seemed to happen when he got close to Christmas and they called this event El Nino and El Nino for them bad news

[15:55] because once they once they encountered this warm water and the lack of fish this was gonna last for months and as possible people were going to starve because he couldn't catch fish maybe for six months or more this is where the name El Nino comes from and they named it that because of association with time of year at Christmas and baby Jesus and all that good stuff and so that's where El Nino actually gets its name so what

[16:25] caused that now what we now know today and they did not know this back then is that something is going to shut this whole circulation system down the Easter bees are gonna die the easterlies die the warm water moves back across the ocean as the mourn water moves back across the ocean the upwelling dies when the upwelling dies the cold water stops coming to the surface when the cold water stops coming to the surface the

[16:56] fish go somewhere I don't know exactly where they go but they but they leave that's El Nino so to explain this I'm going to show a couple animations that explain what an El Nino event looks like so this is a simple little animation that just explains first we're going to look at what I just talked about which is not El Nino not Lenina but just a normal condition so here is going to

[17:26] show this is a cross-section through the ocean and the warm part of the water is this upper part and here's our easterlies also known as the trades and they're blowing from east to west and they're gonna pull up the warm water over here and you're going to get rising air because you got this big pool of warm water and that's going to create a relatively low pressure and so that's what they're showing here and a lot of precipitation rains over here every day and there is also air kind of sinking

[17:58] back out here that's making it high and this is called the Walker circulation cell now what they're trying to show here are those coastal winds from the gyre coming up the coast and here's the upwelling so they're trying to show the here comes that cold water and it comes up to the surface and then it gets pushed along the equator here and then you have this pool of relatively warm water over here now the animator got

[18:29] this wrong because you saw that the the warm water it started creeping in from the west over here which is not right we said that the warm water was pushed across the ocean this way so they got that wrong but this is kind of to show what I I just talked about there should be not just cold water along the coast but a little bit along the equator here okay so we can see this I go back okay so now we're back to what kind of sea

[19:01] surface temperatures alright so notice this you've got this yellow this cooler water and there's this ribbon of yellow kind of along the equator that's cooler water that's being pulled up from the upwelling the upwelling is happening down here and then it's being kind of pulled along with the easterlies you can see the direction of the currents here being essentially pushed pushed to the west over here so that's why it's

[19:32] weird that you've got some of the coldest water around here is right along the equator where you'd expect it to be the warmest because the winds are pushing this cold water along here okay so that's our upwelling so I'm going to add that to our diagram so we've got this ribbon of cool water kind of like in here which are just shade so just to be clear we've got cool

[20:04] water along the coast we got cool water along the coast down here and the easterlies are pushing that along the equator so we have this ribbon a fairly cold air okay so this is not El Nino this is a normal year okay alright so now we're going to go back to the animation okay so this is where we left off the animation so let's see what happens in an El Nino so the El Nino animation is gonna start from this point

[20:35] which is a normal year okay so here we are now what happens is those winds the Tradewinds the easterlies they die down for some reason and in fact they might even reverse and so the ocean starts to slosh back across the equator this big pool of warm water works its way back across the ocean that upwelling stops and instead of having cold water here and cold water along the equator you

[21:06] have relatively warm water also that these two pressure centers reversed so now you've got more of a low pressure over here and more of a high pressure over here so these guys are now relatively dry and these guys are relatively wet so this whole system that is now referred to as El Nino so trade winds or easterly's die warm water sloshes back across the ocean upwelling

[21:38] stops you've got warm water along this coast on this coast and along the equator we didn't have it before that's El Nino now what's La Nina aw Nina we're gonna start again from a normal year so this is a normal year and what happens in a La Nina is that the trade winds get stronger so this is their showing the arrows here getting kind of fatter so the wind is blowing the the easterlies I was blowing

[22:10] harder than they were this makes more upwelling than we used to have that blows the cold water further along the equator towards the west and you'll see that this pool of warm water shrinks a little bit and this pool of cold water grows a little bit that's a long mean iya condition now we know from these chili and fishermen and they kept records for I don't remember how far back but several hundred years that this is a naturally occurring thing so this was happening on earth long before

[22:40] humans were having any effect on the climate and it would happen maybe every five or six or seven years they would have one of these El Nino events and so it's a naturally occurring thing and for the most part we can't really predict it the way we predict it is we actually have if I go back to my El Nino here so I deposit so if an El Nino is coming and we have some like ships out here our

[23:11] buoys with thermometers in them or maybe we can see this from satellites we can watch we can notice that when this warm water starts to creep across the ocean right so if an El Nino is going to happen we can we can detect this warm water on the move before it actually gets to the coast so we can predict it that way but we have no way of saying oh next years in El Nino or the year after that as an El Nino we can't we can't do that is this is not a predictable process when an El Nino happens it

[23:42] happens several this condition lasts for several months so it's not really weather and it's not really climate it's kind of in between right it's a little bit it kind of bridges the gap between climate and weather it's a process that occur that will change the weather for several months at a time so El Nino is one of the two phases was the other being Lonnie Nia we generally refer to both of these two together as ENSO El Nino Southern Oscillation

[24:14] the Southern Oscillation refers to these two pressure centers that swapped so again this right here this is a well we've a normal year not El Nino not La Nina we've got a lo over here we've got a hi over here and in the El Nino one of the things that happened is that these two pressure centers swapped places that's what we call the Southern Oscillation okay that's what it refers to and we're not going to get too deep

[24:44] in this class about what all that means except to say that that's what the name comes from so they'll hear this term and so when you hear and so just think El Nino and La Nina together like it changes between one and the other from year to year but collectively we just called this thing in soul so before we move on to the effects that El Nino has on our weather I want to point out a couple other things with the SST maps so when we talk about El Nino La Nina

[25:14] events is only happening in the Pacific Ocean so apparently the Atlantic Ocean is too small now it has there's something similar going on here there's some upwelling here there's you can see this ribbon of cool water along the equator here but when we talk about Long Nina and El Nino events it doesn't really seem to affect the Atlantic Ocean it's only the Pacific Ocean where all this stuff happens yeah thing I want to point out is we

[25:44] also have some interesting ocean currents in our part of the world so here's the Gulf of Mexico and again this is a day in the summer so we have especially warm water here in the Gulf of Mexico and I want you to notice this stream this current coming out of the Gulf that's called the Gulf Stream and if we kind of fall or it goes there's this ribbon of warm water that there's a bunch of Eddie's and stuff and it makes its way across the Atlantic

[26:16] Ocean and if I kind of look at the big scale here really warm water is coming out of the Gulf of Mexico comes up the East Coast and it heads out to sea and it ends up actually over here by Europe so this part of the ocean right here it's see it's relatively kind of yellow in color compared to over here where you've got this colder green and blue colors so

[26:47] this part of the ocean is being kept warmer because there is a current of warm water that's basically stealing our warm water from the Gulf of Mexico and pumps it out here and dumps it out in this part of the ocean now this is important because for people that live in Europe if you think about the related to it here right right right here if you follow this line of latitude across okay you're in the that would be equivalent

[27:17] to the middle of the United States what if you went up say to this one okay so there's UK and all that there follow this one across and you're in Canada right so what's what are the winners like in this in the middle of Canada well very very cold but they're not nearly so cold over here in Europe

[27:48] even though it's the same latitude why because this body of water that this part of the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than it would be if it wasn't for the Gulf Stream the Gulf Stream takes this warm water brings it up dumps into this part of the ocean keeps Europe warmer than the normally would be in fact if you shut this off somehow Europe would be much much colder in fact it would it

[28:18] would look similar to what it looked like in the last ice age so when we get to climate change which is a couple weeks away one of the things we're going to talk about is the possibility that this stream might shut down and if it shuts down that's going to make Europe a whole lot colder okay so that's a little counter to ative when we talk about the worth getting warmer why could why could Europe suddenly get colder has to do

[28:48] with this I just want to point it out now because that's what we're talking about so if we have an El Nino or La Nina event we can get some really radical changes in the weather and ocean temperatures depending on where you live so for example these guys are catching tropical fish off the coast of Southern California now we just said that the water off the coast of California is really cold because it's from the bottom of the ocean but during it El Nino that up whittling stops in that warm water

[29:19] sloshes back across the ocean and the tropical fish follow of that and so these guys are catching tropical fish in a place which normally really cold water a lot of times animals just can't handle the changes in water temperature so these are zillions of dead crabs that couldn't handle the warmer water of El Nino and again we were in California they washed ashore here by the millions and you gotta wonder how bad this smells after a few days of this but during an

[29:51] El Nino that sudden change in temperature can really kill a lot of animals that are that have adapted to growing in an environment with you know pretty cold water like I said it's usually not - not too much warmer than freezing most of the time and suddenly you have this warm tropical water and a lot of animals can't handle that now the El Nino event itself or La Nina is affecting this area right near the ocean or near the equator and you'd expect

[30:24] well the the weather through here will probably be different because of this but what you may not expect is that this a change in an event down here triggers all kinds of changes of weather all over the world so here's a map showing the types of weather changes that occur during an El Nino and in the winter so December January February so just to reiterate when we have an El Nino or La Nina it lasts for several

[30:55] okay so it may last six months or eight months or four months and so during that time it will have effects on the weather so for example you may not be able to quite quite read the key down here but along the equator it says warm and wet okay that makes sense in a nil ninu you've got warm water sloshing across that should make it warmer and give you more precipitation but then for example up here it says it's going to be warmer

[31:28] or warmer and drier or places where the precipitation increases and notice what's happening over here we've got a green zone that says wetter that we've got a kind of a bluer zone that says cool and wet so this change here is affecting things all over the planet and for us as in New Mexico wearing this green blob so we're going to explain that in a little bit

[31:58] now here's El Nino June July August and notice that we see some changes in different parts of the world right so down here it's cool and dry or what-have-you but notice that for the most part not much as changing in North America in general and especially not in the United States so for us if we have an El Nino it affects our winter precipitation in our winter temperatures and we'll talk more about that in a second does not seem to affect us in the

[32:30] summer okay so keep that in mind that El Nino really affects our winter time if we have a log in yeah again that's gonna make this you know the definition of La Nina is the is the winds here or blooming stronger from the east which makes this colder okay so if it's colder you'd expect to be cooler and drier that makes sense but it also has effects all over the world so for example up in here it says it's making it wetter and down

[33:01] here it's making it drier okay and so we're also you know we're kind of getting up here here in New Mexico or it's gonna have some kind for us to which we'll talk about in a second so the point is you're only changing this but somehow it's having effects all over the planet so why might this be the situation Owen before I forget if I look at anemia again in the summer we see really nothing changing here in the United

[33:31] States okay so El Nino or La Nina doesn't really affect our summer weather at least not that we've been able to determine does affect our winter weather so how is it that the change in the temperature along down here by the equator can have effects all over the planet short answer is it's really complicated but there's one thing that we can learn about in this class that we've talked about before so we talked

[34:02] about the polar front right so let's imagine the polar front is going kind of feel like this on a normal year so to remind you the cold air is up here the warmer is down here in the middle latitude cyclones basically follow this path and that's always changing right there's these curves and the whole thing we've talked about with the rows be waves but in general the storms are kind of coming in through this direction now let's say we have an El Nino so an El Nino means that we have warmer than

[34:35] usual temperatures here and here and here all right this is in an El Nino warmer than normal okay so I just write this out here okay so in an El Nino event it's warmer than normal now the the fact that there is a pool of warmer water here will cause the

[35:06] polar front to shift positions a little bit and it will actually shift a little further to the south I'm exaggerating this greatly just to make a point so the polar front shifts a little further south during an El Nino winter than a normal winter so if we think about mid latitude cyclones right the

[35:36] mid-latitude cyclones are forming along the polar front where are they going to go well during an El Nino because the polar front shifts further south then the mid-latitude cyclones shift further south so what that means is in a non El Nino year just a normal year you'd expect the mid-latitude cyclones to kind of be following say the path of the

[36:06] Green Line coming up into the Pacific Northwest but an El Nino year this whole thing will be shifted down and the Pacific sub I'm sorry the mid-latitude cyclones will be traveling further south well what's further south of this Green Line well we are so US as in New Mexico we'll be in a position where we are more likely to get mid-latitude cyclones than in a normal non El Nino year okay so

[36:36] this is gonna have an effect on our weather because it's shifting the polar front south okay so let's look at a couple maps here so here is a couple of cartoons to try to illustrate this and they're using some slightly different terminology than what we've been using so so far we've been talking about the Jetstream and one type of polar front is actually it splits there's more than one

[37:06] type of jet I don't want to get too deep into this but what they're trying to show here is in an El Nino this Jetstream what I'm calling the polar front is bringing in storms kind of right through here within this orange line which is going to make this area wetter than normal in this area warmer and drier than normal so the storms that we're coming up here are now coming further south in a La

[37:39] Nina the opposite happens in a La Nina the jet polar the polar front again is shifted further to the north so it's exactly the opposite and the storms tend to go further to the north and skip us more often so we end up to be drier and they end up to be wetter okay so what we're doing is we're shifting the location of where those mid-latitude

[38:09] cyclones come in in an El Nino they tend to come further south they make us wetter in a La Nina it's in to go further north make us drier so that's going to have an effect on our overall winter weather so this is a new type of map we haven't seen in this class yeah it's called an anomaly map anomaly means something that's different than normal so these colors this is a says composite precipitation anomalies and what they've

[38:42] done is they've every time there was an El Nino they looked at all the precipitation records for that El Nino event and they compared it to what the average precipitation was in the past okay so what they've noticed is that the places that are blue so it says five case what does that mean that means that during the winter voices that are dark blue on average got five inches of precipitation more than they normally would that's an anomaly

[39:14] whereas places that are say yellow or orange got - one - two - three inches from normal so this isn't telling you how much precipitation they received it's telling you how much extra or how much less they got than what they normally expect right so everyone everybody that's in on this side and these green and aqua colors are getting

[39:44] more precipitation than a normal year you know see that New Mexico is right in here so we get about one inch more than normal during an El Ninos again this is spread out throughout the whole winter right why is that because the mid-latitude cyclones are being directed further south so they come in they dumped a lot in California then they kind of moved downstream towards us and we pick up some of that extra precipitation now these guys are

[40:14] in the red you can see the - three - four - five inches these guys are getting less precipitation than they normally would because the storms that used to come in here are now shifted further south so weather El Nino is good or bad depends on where you live let's say you're a skier right well if your skier in New Mexico you're happy when they'll Nino happens we get more snow if you're a skier in Washington State

[40:45] you're sad when El Nino happens because you have less snow now this is an anomaly map so this is different than average so it does not mean the red does not mean that they are drier than we are this is Washington state right so we get eight inches of precipitation a year in Albuquerque they get like 120 something like that this is saying that there's five inches less than their normal but their normal is way bigger than our no

[41:16] more our normal so keep in mind this doesn't mean that they're dry and we're wet that means they're drier than normal this means we're wetter than normal okay so that's how you read an anomaly map so temperature-wise there can be there is a difference - so if this if the mid-latitude cyclones are coming further south and they're going across the southern United States we're gonna have more cloudy days and that's going to lower the temperature a couple of

[41:46] degrees these guys are gonna have more sunny days and so they're gonna have temperatures a couple degrees greater than average right so in an El Nino winter again all these maps are for winter does not seem to affect our summer we have a wetter than normal winter we have a cooler than normal winter these guys have a drier than normal winter and a warmer than normal winter for an El Nino La Nina everything's flipped almost so

[42:16] the storms are concentrated to come up and here more than they do and they miss us almost completely and so here we have you know negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 inches again over the whole winter that's that would be 1 2 or 3 inches less than what we normally get so if you notice so so Albuquerque is in this one right here and that's somewhere between negative 2 and negative 3 inches so that means that during a lawn Nino

[42:46] winter we expect 2 to 3 inches below normal precipitation well how much precipitation do we normally get throughout the whole winter in New Mexico maybe like two inches so two inches minus two is zero so when we have a long Nina it often often results in the winter that's almost completely dry so we in the southwest hate anaemia because it means the area of the country

[43:18] that's already really dry remember that Pacific subtropical high we've been talking about makes this whole area desert well in a Lonnie Mia winter it gets worse because now the storms are missing us even more than often they're going up here and we're even drier again weaken it there are winters on record where it literally did not produce any measurable precipitation during the la Nino on the other hand these guys are getting footed because now they're getting way more storms and they normally get they're

[43:49] already used to a lot of precipitation because it's Pacific Northwest but now they're getting even more so you can see they're getting you know excess of 5 inches above what they normally expect for their winter now there's a temperature anomaly but it doesn't quite match up like you might expect in general this part of the country is warmer than in Oh anemia you might think we would be too but for some reason it doesn't ever seem to work out that way so most of New

[44:19] Mexico's temperatures don't change that much with a la anemia but up in the Pacific Northwest and actually all these northern states up here are usually having cooler than normal winter temperatures so we're going to look at another use of the anomaly map and this is says weekly average sea surface temperature anomaly so what that means is everywhere that's the yellow and orange and red colors correspond the places where the ocean is warmer than it

[44:52] normally is so for this location it's warmer than average what's average usually 30 years places that are blue are cooler than their average so realize how you have to interpret an anomaly map right here is a blob of water that's warmer than their average right here a blob of water that's cooler than their average but this is that part of the ocean I said was always the warmest part right so the

[45:22] pool of water right here is really warm all the time it's always going to be warmer than whatever is down here so you can't get confused and think that oh this is warmer because it's more orange no no that means it's warmer than average and this is cooler than average but their average is still way warmer than theirs okay so you can't compare direct temperatures in an anomaly map you can only look at differences from average okay so we're in 1982 this was a El Nino

[45:54] year and this is gonna become an animation and you're gonna see the weeks click by and what we're looking for are colors around the equator here that show that the ocean is warmer than average and if we see that we know we have an El Nino ok so watch right in here and you see those orange colors come and go right there that's the El Nino right through here so that's a location in the ocean that's far warmer

[46:25] normal that's what happens during an El Nino because the up lowing shuts off okay a similar situation now our 1999 this is a La Nina and we can see the Von Nina occurring already it's this dark blue color so that's where places that's where the ocean is colder than normal and so in a La Nina we expect exactly the opposite that what we just saw we expect to see blue colors along here and you can watch when start the animation

[46:56] you can watch how it'll kind of grow back and forth here along the equator okay so there's the the blue goes away a little bit comes back a little bit so this is one La Nina event right through there okay so the ocean can go back and forth between El Nino and La Nina from year to year and a lot of years is not in either one and so there's been some

[47:26] attempts to try to describe how strong an El Nino or La Nina is and so here's one example it's called the ocean Nino index also known as the El Nino index or the ENSO index so here is so on the x-axis we have time right so this is January 2004 January 2005 each one of these marks is another year okay so if you have one of these Peaks that's on

[47:56] the the red part of the graph that was an El Nino if you have a peak in the blue part of the graph that's a La Nina and the higher the peak the stronger event so this is a very strong El Nino right here this is a very strong El Nino right here these would be considered El Ninos but they're pretty weak these are pretty strong long Nina's and these are pretty weak ones so a lot of years if you have a little peak like that one or

[48:26] that one you'd be say this is an in so neutral year it's a little bit and the long mean they're a little bit in the El Nino direction but not enough to count in some way years you've got these weak Vence and then some years we have these strong events and some years we have a couple years in a row of the same thing so for example here there was one winter 8687 which was in El Nino and then the next year after that even stronger El Nino so

[48:57] think about what that would do for New Mexico's precipitation El Nino year wet winter right so we likely had two winners in a row that had an above average precipitation on the other hand look at what happened here La Nina anemia and then really wimpy La Nina followed after that but this whole time in here the ocean is in a La Nina State wanyan yeah dry winter so we're looking at two or three or maybe four years in a

[49:29] row where New Mexico would have had an a winter with below average precipitation and for us that's a big deal you got dry winter after dry winter after dry winter it adds up and you've got yourself you you're in a drought at that point you
