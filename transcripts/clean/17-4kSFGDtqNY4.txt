hey this is Mel strong and in this lecture we're going to be talking about some of the major water projects of the southwestern United States so the big picture here is that if we look at a map of precipitation for the US and we've seen this map before there's this big blob of orange and red colors here in the southwest in if we just kind of drew a circle kind of a right through around there there's about 40 million people living in the driest part of the country and today's lecture is about how that is possible so this is more of a history and maybe a little bit of politics lecture and less on science so before we start just imagine the following imagine if somebody came to you and said you can continue living here in Albuquerque or Arizona or wherever you live but the deal is you can only have the water that fell from this guy okay how easy would it be to live here I mean it would be pretty tough to carve out a living if you could only use the water that actually fell as precipitation right and yet we have the system that you just turn on the faucet boom water comes out it's a miracle question is how did all that come to be how does it work and when did it happen and for most of the things we're talking about today all of this happened before any of us were born okay this is a system that was that was started over a hundred years ago people are still working on it and we completely depend on this for to live in in the driest part of the country so we're gonna start our story in Los Angeles in fact the big motivating factor behind what we're going to be talking about is population growth so if you go back to 1900 okay these are the state populations rights under so New Mexico has you know under two hundred thousand people in the whole state California has one-half million and if you project forward when this paper came out it was 2007 so a little over a hundred years later you can see that states like California you know 36 million so their population didn't just devil didn't quadruple it didn't he wasn't even ten times it went up twenty times right and you see that in a lot of these states that the population pretty much all these states the populations increase by way more than ten times in a hundred years so you've got all these people living in an area that's very very dry and so we're gonna actually start our story in Los Angeles we're in the late 1800s there was just a few thousand people living there and at the time there was a bunch of real estate investors and they bought up a bunch of land around Los Angeles and they thought here's what we're gonna do we're going to sell this place as a great place to live and so they went up to San Francisco in San Francisco at the time was the biggest city along the west coast it was this major port city we just had the gold rush and all that and so these real estate investors came in and they said listen aren't you guys tired of this cold crappy foggy San Francisco weather well let me tell you about a great place to live where it's sunny almost every day it's called Los Angeles and we've got some property to sell you and this plan actually worked in about 30 years la goes from being a few thousand people to over a hundred thousand people that move there at the same time early 1900s we start to get the very first movies now today everybody knows where Hollywood is Hollywood's in Southern California that's the you know for a long time has been the movie capital of the world well why didn't it start there right I give all the places in the world or in the United States why did Hollywood get set up there okay so if you go back and you watch an old timey movie like an old silent movie with an indoor scene like this one so it looks like they're filming this indoors but actually there's no roof on this this is natural light coming in these old movies they didn't have artificial lighting yet so the only way they could film is if you had a sunny day so they needed a place to to build their studios where they could have as much natural light as possible so they could film all the time and so this area right down here is a place that is sunny almost every day of the year why is that review question why is it so dry why is it so neat I'm sorry so sunny over here well a big reason is our old friend the Pacific subtropical high right so the Pacific subtropical high is responsible for why Hollywood is where it is today because that constant sinking air keeps the sky clear allowed those old timey movies to have natural lighting ok so that's how it all got started Pacific subtropical high all right so so lady 200s we go from a few thousand people to over a hundred thousand people and at first the people that show up and live in this area are getting water out of the local rivers so there's something called le river a few creeks that feed it cases the map of it today and that works for a little while if you have a few thousand people but by the time you get to a hundred thousand that's not enough water to go around and so they started to drill well so we're gonna talk a little bit here about groundwater for a minute so below the ground there exists a body of water in most places and this water becomes replenished in the winter so in this diagram you've got some topography and this blue represents water that has soaked in from above so usually what happens in our part of the world during the wet season like the winter along the west coast rain will fall and will soak down into the ground and then what most people don't realize is that the groundwater is actually moving now the water table itself is is this surface that's called the water table and anytime you have a river that's just where the water table comes out onto the surface so here's an idea here's a little diagram of this so you get what are called recharge areas these are areas where the precipitation is added soaks down and then it's actually on its way you know it's moving downhill the water underneath the ground is moving downhill and ultimately it's headed to the ocean okay now this shows it moving kind of left and right towards these rivers but it's also moving either in or out of the slide depending on which way is towards the ocean so what that means is if you drill down far enough you could get groundwater like this trying to show a well that they didn't drill far enough so it's dry here's one where some water is kind of piled up here on this barrier so that when they're getting water out of point--is for most places in the world you drill down you'll probably eventually find some water okay you just have to drill deep enough so they do this in Los Angeles and this is a map of 200 large wells that are drilled in lausanne in the Los Angeles area so these are not like in your backyard wells these are wells that are big enough to supply water to a whole neighborhood okay so they pump a lot of water out of the ground well there's a problem when you start to pump a lot of water out of the ground so here's the water table okay so here's some wells and as they're pumping water out of the ground you can see that the water table lowers a little bit by each one of these wells that's sometimes called a cone of depression so here they've put in this you know this is trying to show they put in this new well here and they're going to pump a lot and so it pulls down the water table as they remove water out of this big high-capacity well and these guys there well went dry now because the water table has been lowered so basically mother nature cannot replenish the groundwater as fast as the humans are pulling it out okay so back to the Los Angeles when they start pulling the everybody starts printing in well at first people are able to pull water out of the ground but as more and more people do that pretty soon the water table all starts to go down the people wells start to go dry and they have to read rill those wells deeper and deeper so here is a little graph of depth to the water table okay so now this only starts in 1935 and our story's starting back in the late 1800s and we don't really have any data for that but just from 1935 to 1960 what this is it says ground water elevation feet from sea level so remember la is pretty close to sea level okay so what this means is back then if you drill down til or a 60 feet above sea level you hit ground water right but then if you go ahead to 1945 you had to drill down until was 40 feet above sea level and then you had to drill down to sea level and then you had to drill down to 60 feet below sea level so what's happening from 1940 to 1960s he is blue line here people were have to drill deeper and deeper and deeper holes just to get to the groundwater because everybody was pumping it out faster than mother nature could replenish it so on average the groundwater has drop in 8 feet per year ok well they have an additional problem in that if you so here's our little cone of depression here if you pump down the water table and you happen to live close to the ocean then sea water will come in and take the place of the fresh water so normally before the well was drilled there was fresh water that was coming down and Sierra Nevadas in the case of LA and migrating on this diagram from left to right and then out into the ocean so you had constant fresh water moving underground but once you start pumping it out and you start removing the groundwater then salty water will come back in and replace it and then people start getting salt in their groundwater so there's a limit as to how much groundwater the people in the Los Angeles could pump out before it started to go Saul okay so to recap they took water out of the river network for a little while then they started to pump wells that will work for a little while but they start to run out of water and realize that this groundwater solution is only temporary you can't keep pumping water out of the ground okay so by 1900 again we're about a hundred thousand people there are they're already running into trouble and they don't have enough well water they don't have enough river water what are they gonna do and all these people have moved here right so this whole campaign to get people to move here in Hollywood and all that skin going and it's clear that people that want to live in Los Angeles but there's not enough water so here on this map here is LA and if you're in one if you're in my class you had to do this project trying to find some things on on the map and one of the things that I asked you to find was something called Owens Lake okay and I have owns like right up here with a little dashed line so this is Lake that sits up here so they're thinking about what to do and someone said well you know here's a crazy idea what so so the reason this Lake exists you know this is all desert by the way this is all desert but there's a lake up here in the desert and the reason that Lake is there is because there's these little streams that come out of the mountains out of the Sierras and they drain down into Owens Lake so what if we captured those streams and instead of allowing the streams to fill the lake we we laid this giant pipe all the way from this lake all the way to Los Angeles and we'll just take that stream water and we'll redirect it to LA okay sounds crazy but that's what they did and so they decided this you know this again this is a lady to her hundreds early 1900s when they're thinking about this they're gonna start this giant project to take water that should be going into Owens Lake and bring it all the way across the desert to Los Angeles so we don't have a lot of pictures Owens like from back then this is one of them so here you can see we've got the Sierras here in the background you see this body of water here okay this is about 1900 there's some mining town or something here up and up in the foreground here and they're going to form what's called the LA aqueduct that is this red line that runs from Owens Lake all the way down to Los Angeles so again if you're one of my students I have put up a map with all the things I'm showing you okay it's all on it's all on learn so you can so you can go and see this print them out whatever whatever you want to do so the LA aqueduct huge project they started this thing in 1908 223 miles of pipe were laid to take water from Owens Lake all the way to LA they finish it in 1913 realize at the time what they're dealing with in terms you know cars hadn't really been invented I mean a little bit but not so much pretty much everything is doing is with you know mule teams there's no electricity there's no tractors and they're doing this big project right so it was a pretty significant thing to build so here is another old picture again there's Owens Lake in the background and here's this concrete conduit that's the LA aqueduct so what's gonna flow in the bottom of this ditch and in here it kind of looks like the oils that we have around here in Albuquerque is water that's supposed to be flowing into the lake but instead is headed south then from this concrete ditch this is what it looks like today okay so that's water that's on its way to LA it will go into these pipes so these are the pieces that were these big pieces they were brought made in Germany and brought in the you can still see see them today there they are going across the desert floor they go up mountains oops they go down mountains they go across the desert through towns across freeways and then eventually that water comes down into the LA basin so this thing right here it's like a bunch of little stairs that's water coming down into Los Angeles so the guy that I was in charge of this is William Mulholland and Mulholland is this kind of famous name in LA there's Mulholland Drive and you'll hear songs and movies referencing Mulholland so that guy was he was in charge of this project and in the 1980s there was a pretty famous book written called Cadillac desert and it goes into detail about this and some of the other water projects were talking about and PBS in the mid 90s put out this big mini-series on Cadillac desert and I think it was like like nine hours long something like that and for whatever reason they never released it as an actual video that you can watch today so the only parts of it that exist are parts that were recorded on VCRs back in the 90s and uploaded to YouTube so the quality is really really poor and I'm just gonna show you a couple minutes of a clip of them building the LA aqueduct so again I apologize the quality is pretty poor it's the only thing we really have today so I'm going to show that real quick here [Music] it was a great drama it was a great epic drama of the building of that aqueduct do you have mule teams and you have men they were working in desert heat arid conditions water was a problem ironically enough here in this giant water project they had they had to worry about adequate water for the working stock and the men it can be almost freezing it at night and then 110 degrees in the daytime practically maja was there all the time chief engineer Mulholland had no formal training in civil engineering he had in fact never graduated from grade school the automobile had barely been invented clipper ships were still sailing the seas and this was an engineering project the likes of which the world had really never seen before Mulholland ordered two 12-foot steel pipe forged in Germany and shipped around the horn a hundred thousand men and women worked on the aqueducts but never more than a few thousand at a time because the exhausting and dangerous work kept turnover so high they had been farmhands cowboys and hard rock miners but now they were city employees civil servants like the chief himself with no air-conditioning no refrigeration no hard hats in 110 degree heat they crossed the Mojave in five years with a pipe big enough to hold a locomotive this was you know an aqueduct that would have reached all the way across Massachusetts and then almost all the way back through a desert with mountains what they were really building was was the world's largest garden hose surveyor said they could build the aqueduct simply by following the trail of whiskey bottles Mulholland and Eaton had thrown off the back of their buckboard in 1904 in the end the chief and his lieutenants finished the job under budget and ahead of schedule William Mulholland built his original aqueduct so well that to this day it still carries the Owens River to the people of Los Angeles the phrase Grandpa's aqueduct will remind my first words the day of the dedication of the aqueduct was without a doubt the high point of my grandfather's life a crowd of 30 to 40,000 Los Angelenos had gathered at the base of the spillway there was a formal program but once the water spilled down the Cascade the formal program was abandoned because thousands of people rushed with their tin cups to drink the water when the water came cascading down there Mahal and who was really exhausted at the time gave what I think is the most concise dedication speech in history he unfurled an American flag he turned to the water and he said there it is taken [Applause] based on Mulholland predictions it was four times more water than Los Angeles could use so you probably figured out that was mo Holland's granddaughter in that in that movie the other thing they wanted you to pay attention to is in the opening ceremony yeah the release the water comes down the spillway and all that and Mulholland says this is four times the amount of water that Los Angeles is ever going to need so keep that in mind okay so they take the waters that are supposed to be going into Owens Lake they redirect them to LA what happens to the lake dries up okay so if you're one of my students and you're trying to find Owens Lake on the map you may have had some trouble because the lake no longer exists here we can see where it was this big brown spot used to be full of water okay and notice what's around right this is pretty dry sagebrush we're in a pretty dry area and you can see from space where the lake used to be so this again kind of light-colored spot right there and this lake was pretty important to the environment because when you have a lake sitting out here in the desert it's super important for all kinds of organisms to survive out there and that includes those that live around the lake plus a lot of the migratory animals that stopped there to refuel and what-have-you before they move on so you know a lot of migratory birds for example used to stop at Owens Lake on their way one way or the other and now they can't do that because that Lake is no longer there so this is you know there was a complete collapse of the ecosystem around from the disappearance of Lake Owens and you'll notice here that this so this is what it looks like today these are all mostly kind of salts that were left behind after the lake dried up see this kind of white if you walk on this is kind of white crunchy texture to it and when the wind blows it blows up dust from this lake bed now if you remember a few lectures ago on air pollution we said that particulate matter PM is one of the regulated pollutants that we keep track of in this country from the Clean Air Act so in the 80s the EPA goes to the city of Los Angeles and says see all this PM that's your guys's fault okay cuz you caused this lake to dry up and now the winds blow and that dust and you're responsible so la says okay here's what we're going to do we will drill a well and we're going to install sprinklers on the bottom oh it used to be the lake bed so they're irrigating the bottom of the dried-up lake bed to prevent the dust from blowing all this PM up into the air okay that's their solution there's been a few attempts to try to reintroduce a little bit of water into the lake to try to get some of the wildlife to come back you can see this little sector here has a little bit of water in it when I say a little bit it's literally just a few inches of deep right so all the white area that's that's the salty spots again so a little bit but not enough to really bring it back to anywhere where in the status it used to be well that works for a while and we get to 1930 and the population of LA has increased tenfold again to over a million people and oh look we're out of water so no it wasn't four times the amount of water that la would need thirty years or so later they're already out of water so what are they gonna do so they look around on the map and I said well here's a crazy idea way up north there's another Lake Cod Mono Lake how about we do this same game plan and we extend our aqueduct up here and take the water that's supposed to be going into Mono Lake so this is the plan and what they do is they extend that aqueduct that went up to Owens Lake and they continue on this red line here in a 1941 they get all the way to Mono Lake and they start taking the waters that are supposed to be going into Mono Lake well this is what Mono Lake looks like today now it has not dried up yet and we'll talk about why in a second but you can see the lake used to be a lot bigger you can see where the old shorelines used to be out here these are islands that used to be underwater okay so it used to me about twice as big as it is today well it was drying up and in fact by the time you get to about 1960 or so the volume of the lake had halved and the salinity had doubled so you see in this body of water it's twice as salty as it was before and animals are having trouble surviving things are starting to die out and it looks like to everybody that the whole ecosystem is collapsing just like Owens Lake did right so a bunch of citizens got together and they cited before this lake completely dries up like Owens Lake we're gonna fight this in court and they got together and they sued city of Los Angeles and there was in the 1970s there's something called the Mono Lake committee citizens and some scientists got together and started these lawsuits to try to slow the destruction of Mono Lake and it goes to court and after several years they decided that they said okay he the court decision essentially was if I go back here la is allowed to take water but they cannot allow the lake to go below a certain level which is the level you see here in this picture so it's not going to get any deeper it's not gonna get any fuller but it's also not supposed to go down anymore okay so that's the ruling that came out and again this was 70s and 80s when this happens and so that you know that was a result of citizens just getting together and suing and trying to prevent this whole ecosystem from collapsing in the same way that Owens Lake did okay well by time he gets in 1960 the population has now doubled since 1930 when they started to go to Mono Lake and again they're out of water right so another solution they come up with is to double up the aqueduct and so there's a second LA aqueduct that goes parallel to the first one so on this picture this is the first one that pipe right there that's the second one okay over here there's the first one there is a second one so they just have two pipes right next to each other going right up to Lake Owens so that they can take twice as much water so from LA up to Owens Lake there's actually two pipes next to each other and then there's only one that goes the rest of the way to Mono Lake okay well Ellie's out of water still after going to Owens Lake after going to Mono Lake after doubling up the aqueducts after getting the water out of the rivers after getting the well water so they start looking around right well you know what there's a nice little river over here called the Colorado sure would be nice would take if we could take some water out of that so this brings up an important point which is who legally is able to take water out of a river if the river is shared between several states so this is the Colorado River starts in Colorado up up up here off the map actually comes down through from Colorado through Utah through Arizona it's on the border between Arizona and Nevada it's also on the border between Arizona and California it goes to Mexico goes out into the Gulf of California so here's the problem let's say Arizona says ok so in case you didn't know this is the Grand Canyon right here right so what's preventing Arizona from saying we're gonna put in a giant dam right here or we're gonna block the water we're gonna make this giant we're gonna fill the whole Grand Canyon full of water and we're just going to keep it and nobody downstream is going to get any of it so none of it goes to California so what's preventing Arizona from doing that because technically any state on the river here could put up some kind of dam and everybody downstream would would suffer right so States realized they got to figure something now this is about a hundred years ago and they're thinking about this so what they decide is that if you are part of what's called the Colorado River watershed you are entitled to a portion of the Colorado River water now what is a watershed so all of these little red lines are Little rivers and little creeks that ultimately go into the Colorado River right so if you are raindrop and you fall and you land in this red zone anywhere here you'll end up in the Colorado River that's the watershed ok this whole area are all these rivers that ultimately feed the Colorado River we're gonna zoom in a little bit here so the Colorado River itself doesn't even go through New Mexico for example right it's over here ok and it goes this way but here we are here's New Mexico and notice that we have some of those little red lines over here so we have a bunch of little creeks that ultimately flow to the west and end up in the Colorado River so what this means is states like ours we don't have the Colorado River but because our little streams feed the Colorado River we are legally entitled to a portion of the Colorado River water as are all the states that have a little bit of these red lines okay including California now California has a pretty tiny measly amount of watershed right it's just like a couple little chunks of red line here that's the only thing that feeds the Colorado River and they're in the desert anyway so that's not a lot of water but technically they're allowed to have some of the Colorado River water well they decided that what they're going to do is they're going to split up all of these states into what we call upper basin States and lower Basin States so these are all states that are part of that watershed they all legally get some water okay but they're gonna subdivide and again here's that little bit though of California here but they're gonna sub you're gonna subdivide the Colorado River water up between all of the states that have part of this either upper basin or lower basin shading okay so all these states get something so in 1922 a bunch of politicians get together to hash out what's called the Colorado River Compact the Colorado River Compact is like a treaty among instead of treaty among nations as a treaty among states and they decide okay we're gonna figure out who gets what now is it evenly divided based on the watershed know who gets the most amount of water California gets the biggest amount of water even though they have a very tiny portion of the watershed but they had the biggest population so they had most political weight when this is all decided there's a unit here capital am capital a FY that stands for million acre feet per year what does that mean an acre imagine a football field okay now imagine a football field that you flood with twelve inches of water a foot so now you've got a flooded football field with a foot of water on it that's called an acre foot of water now imagine you can't really but a million of those that's a million acre-feet okay so what this is saying is that Colorado you get three point eight eight six million acre-feet per year and Nevada you get point three million acre-feet per year so this is all hashed out in 1922 now how did they come up with these numbers well what they did is they went and they surveyed the Colorado River and they wanted to figure out how much water does the Colorado River deliver okay so in 1922 they go out with a bunch of gauges and they're measuring how much flow was coming down the Colorado and then they look at that number and they divide it up between all these states well we now know there was a problem with that 1922 was an unusually wet year and we've had very few years since then as wet as 1922 so all of these numbers are based on an unusually wet year which means that today on a normal drier year that these numbers cannot be obtained but there's a treaty in 1922 that says each state gets to have this much water so right away out of the gate we get a problem because the states are now fighting each other that they're not getting their fair share of water we are we've been in the drought we'll talk about this later for many years in the southwest which means that these numbers are much lower than you know much much lower than they were in 1922 so this is a cause for friction in in the southwest because everybody wants to the water they're legally entitled to it but there's just not enough to go around okay so once that's hashed out in 1922 and it races okay you get this much do you get this much do you get this much now people can start building dams and taking water out of the Colorado River okay so again if you're one of my students we on your map I had you find some of these dams and sand outline some of these reservoirs and again I have put a map on learn with what these features on there one of the very first dams major dams that's get gets built is Hoover Dam okay which is now next to modern-day Las Vegas this is what Hoover Dam looks like before they built it as the site of Hoover Dam you see how these rock there's that there's a narrow kind of a v-shape here whenever they're trying to build a dam they're looking for a spot where the River narrows because it makes it easier to build across this so they're gonna fill up this V in this Canyon with concrete and that's gonna be Hoover Dam so here they are building it this is in the 30s kind of a depression-era project puts a lot of people to work and here's what it looks like when it's done so this is the Colorado River now it's stuck behind this wall that's over dam and notice these towers here okay and I'm going to show you another picture of referencing these towers in a second so they build this dam 1935 and the Colorado River comes up behind it and gets stuck and starts to fill up with water and that's going to become Lake Mead so here we are filling up the dam here's those four towers again and here's what it looks like when it's full there's the four towers all the ones off the picture this is one of the few times that Lake Mead was full in fact it's flowing over this this overspill area right here this is in the 1980s and then usually what time turns out it's almost never ever ever looks like this okay this is what it looks like when like me and is actually full so the lake you realize was formed by just flooding the river that was behind the dam right so we the river was coming along and doing its own thing we fill this up with concrete and now the water starts to build up behind it so this is gonna make a lake but it's a weird Lake like normally if you if you explain if you tell somebody I'm going to go up to a lake they're kind of visualizing usually something kind of roundish but we're making artificial lakes here by putting a dam up and and so we're flooding a what used to be a river and it just floods it up straight and makes a makes a very unusual shaped lake and here you can see those how dry this is okay what if you haven't been to Las Vegas you know what's it like this is temperatures routinely over 100 degrees in the summer the relative humidity is a few percent routinely here's like Mead winding out into the distance rakes this is just this was a river valley but now it's full of water look how dry it is right nothing nothing growing here at all what's the evaporation rate do you think you got temperatures over a hundred degrees routinely relative humidity single percent big surface area right big surface area you're losing a lot of water to to evaporation and so you're in this area that's super dry you're building dams to store water because you want water to live where it's super dry but you're also losing a lot of it through evaporation well once Lake Mead is built or if sorry once Hoover Dam is built and the Lake Mead is their loss and Las Vegas was this little tiny nothing in 1930 this is the whole city but now you've got a source of water the dam is producing electricity so yeah source electricity prohibition ends and also we had a moratorium on gambling most people don't know this but back prohibition days you couldn't gamble either and so all those things prohibition ends gambling is legal you got a source of water you got electricity Las Vegas just explodes right and so water use in Las Vegas explodes along with it so here's a population and this is in thousands so so a thousand thousand is a million right so the population is going up that's these dots right and then as it goes up the water consumption goes up to in millions of gallons per day now this is coming out of the groundwater there so they're using groundwater whether they can they're using water out of Lake Mead because it's there and they're legally entitled to some of it but of course the water is very much needed for very important things like the Bellagio fountains right you've got to have that do you think there's any evaporation going on here you're throwing little droplets of water up into a hundred plus degree air with relative humidities and single digits how much water do you suppose they're losing here just an evaporation or maybe you need to use that water for other very important things like golf courses and I especially like this picture to show the stark contrast between the super dry desert here in the background and the heavily irrigated Golf Course right next to it so that's where a lot of this water ends up going out of the Colorado River so that is Hoover Dam and Lake Mead right we go upstream we go through the Grand Canyon go through the Grand Canyon go through the Grand Canyon and we get up here and there's another dam called the Glen Canyon Dam and behind the Glen Canyon Dam is Lake Powell so same idea the Colorado River was coming through here minding its own business we put up this big dam we block it the river canyon floods and so now we have this big funny windy looking lake called Lake Powell which is just a flooded river canyon so it's this weird windy looking thing well glen canyon dam was built at a time when this was in the 50s and there's actually a significant amount of protests around building this dam and the reason for that is because glen canyon itself was a canyon that people actually like to visit it was kind of an extension of the Grand Canyon so the picture on the right is what it looked like before they flooded it so all this water is flooding this Canyon right there's water up to the top of this canyon at least there is in this picture this is what it looked like this is what they flooded and there's a significant number people who thought this is a really bad idea because this is a really beautiful place it's one of the nicest places in the world to go you can go rafting you go fishing you can go camping and we don't want to lose this we don't want to flood it like this doesn't make any sense and people fought this and so these pictures I'm showing you are what it looked like before the dam was built so these are all pictures from the 1950s or before so you can see it's a pretty nice place right I mean it carrying mines you of the Grand Canyon it's it's similar to to the Grand Canyon except it's now all underwater people used to go rafting slot canyons the whole thing here they are starting to build the dam the dam is going to go right here okay so that Canyon behind us that's going to be filled with water now an interesting point to this story is that because we've had a lot of drought in the last 20 years in the southwest that Lake Powell is no longer up to the top like I showed you in those earlier pictures and as the lake has been receding it's revealing some of the original Canyon not like it used to be but you you're starting to actually see a canyon again so that's an example where some you know groups got together they fought the formation of a dam didn't work out it's dam was still built there are still groups today fighting to get the dam removed okay so this is I mean I don't think they have a very good chance of this but there's still people are still trying to get that damn removed worth pointing out that there was also another dam that was going to go up somewhere around in here kind of in the middle of between Hoover Dam and Glen Canyon Dam and that one was also fought and that one was dropped so we could have had another dam that would have floated a good portion of the Grand Canyon and our predecessors thankfully I think fought that and per invented that so we actually have the Grand Canyon as it is today so we're going to talk a little bit about some of the problems of putting dams on a river like the Colorado and let's just imagine that we had you know think about a river going down a slope and the water is coming down doing what rivers do and then what I'm gonna do is put up this dam and the water is going to accumulate behind the dam fill up and produce a reservoir right and then I'm gonna have some way of releasing a little bit of water out the bottom that continues on down the stream right so that's the system that we have in place so what's the problem with that so one of the biggest problems is if you are an organism like a fish and you are trying to say get from here to here you've got a problem because you've got this big dam structure in the way okay and some fish really need to migrate that's part of their natural life cycle so salmon are a classic example so salmon start start their life out up in a very shallow slow-moving Creek and they lay eggs okay and then the parents die off and the eggs hatch in the spring and you got a little baby salmon with you guys and they grow in this river again a very slow moving River usually for a couple years and then when they get big enough they migrate downstream and they head towards the ocean so they come out into the ocean and they'll spend years out in the ocean swimming around doing whatever salmon do late in life they come back to the same river that they came out of and we don't know how they do this they must they must every River must have a unique chemical signature that they can detect somehow but they'll go back and find the same river they came from and they'll go upstream so they gotta go up the river now and so whenever you see pictures of salmon jumping trying to get up little rapids or waterfalls they're trying to get back to the place where they were born now go all the way back to the place where they were born they find a mate they lay eggs and then they die and the whole process starts again right so this is what salmon do so if you put up a dam in the middle of that whole process you've just prevented this whole lifecycle from taking place right which is a major bummer if you're a salmon trying to make a living now there's a few things that have been done to try to mitigate this namely something called fish ladders so the dam is over here okay and so just to orient you so there's a there's a stream that would be kind of behind us so before the dam was in place the salmon would come this way and then they just go upstream to where you know this concrete would not have been there originally and they just go up to where they need to go but now this concrete's here so what they have is you can see these little look like little steps that's a fish ladder and so the salmon figure out that there's water coming down this way so they instinctively go up and they go up all the way these through these steps up up up up up up up and then they jump off and they land on the other side of the dam that's a fish ladder and there are places where you can actually kind of watch this in action so here's a salmon trying to jump the stairs of a fish ladder and there's you see a bunch of them trying to get up the fish ladder so it kind of works definitely some salmon are able to return home through fish ladders and keep going but a big problem you have is with oxygenation so back in my picture of this dam here if this fills with water the water down here is very stagnant okay and because it's very stagnant has very little oxygen and dams are designed to release water out at the bottom so the water that comes out of the bottom of this dam also has little oxygen now that's not true with the water that goes into the dam right you've got Rapids you've got fast-moving water gurgling bubbling there's a lot of oxygen in there it fills up this reservoir and stagnates and that little oxygen water comes out goes down stream so any animals that are down here are stuck in this water that has relatively little oxygen a lot of them don't like that sometimes your deoxygenation can get to the point that fish actually die so this is here we're in the dam okay so now we're we're talking about fish living in this part in the reservoir and the oxygen level got so low that a whole bunch of fish died and usually happens overnight so during the day there's some photosynthesis that's helping reoxygenate the water but then respiration is happening all night long and that's when your oxygen level goes down so this can happen if you don't have enough oxygen in your reservoirs the deep water also is colder so this water that comes out down here not only is low oxygen but it's cold and again we're thinking about the animals that lived in the in the water before the dam was built they are used to pretty shallow pretty fast-moving water which is oxygenated and warmer than what's coming out of the dam right so what's coming out of the dam now is colder it has less oxygen and a lot of the animals just can't survive in that the other weird thing is that this water up here at the very top of the dam is actually warmer than it normally is it's stagnant there's isn't there's not a lot of mixing the Sun's up every day and it's warming the the top layer of that water and so for example you take something like this Glen Canyon Dam is we've seen this picture before Canyon Dam and Lake Powell and this used to be a fast-moving river which is now just pretty stagnant and you go from the water that was in the Glen Canyon Dam or I'm sorry in Glen Canyon before the dam and you can see it's kind of choppy and it's aerated and could cooler temperature compared to the surface of what's on lake powell today and see how all those green stuff that's algae analogy is happy in this environment where there's not a lot of motion and it's relatively warm because we're talking about water at the top of the lake now not the bottom the bottom is called but the top isn't is warm so this is what it looks like now this is what when we built that dam Glen Canyon Dam we transformed this kind of water to this kind of water and that's again because it's stagnant it has really warm along the surface they prevent sediment from moving downstream okay so if you've got sediment coming down normally coming down it's being washed down and it heads out to the ocean but what happens is it starts to pile up behind the dam okay now why would that be important if you look at the mouth of a normal River so here comes here comes the river dumping out into the ocean you can see all this mud and you can see in the water that it has this brown or color this is sediment and this sediment is actually really needed by a lot of the ecosystems downstream from where the dam is is built so here's a couple of examples so here's our dam and here's the sediments that are accumulated behind the dam and the water is coming out so at first the water is flowing where it used to okay but because we are keeping the sediment trap back here that River will start to cut down into the surrounding rock and there's no sediment to come back and rebuild anything so what happens is the river starts actually cutting down word into the landscape now when the river cuts down the other thing that happens is it the water table also goes down with it so let's say in this scenario we had a river that was kind of near the surface here but and we had some trees let's just draw here let's say we've got some trees growing kind of by the river and they have a root system okay the root system comes down like this okay now as the river cuts down right as the river cuts down into the surrounding country eventually the water table goes down with it and the roots which used to be able to get ground water from the surrounding river now are dry because the river has now cut down below where the root systems are okay so that so I'm exaggerating this to illustrate a point but if the sediment is blocked then the river cuts cuts down cuts down cuts down water table drops with it and eventually you can drop far enough down that some vegetation downstream will eventually die because it can get water so therefore if you block sediment then the river downstream well you wrote away case we just talked about that rivers downstream cut down deeper than they used to okay so we talked about that and the water table lowers downstream and vegetation can die okay so those things can happen by just blocking the sediments from going downstream now everything we've been talking about is how the natural animals and plant life don't like these changes they don't like though the water that might be cold or has less oxygen or whatever or there's something that will right if you set up an artificial lake essentially and you change the temperature and you change the oxygen and there's some other organism that's actually going to thrive in that and they're going to get into these lakes and they're going to do well and you're going to an invasive species problem on your hands so by building dams and building these artificial reservoirs we're setting up situations environments for innovate invasive species to come in and wreak havoc on the natural ecosystem if you are in my class you had to identify a few major dams on a few rivers but realize there's a lot more than what the ones that we're talking about here so on the map that we're using in my class which again is on learn or on my website here's a number of dams in various states which means that there's over 5,000 dams that are on that map I just had to identify a handful of them they're all different sizes right so they're not as always big as Hoover Dam some of them they're just a little structure just right underneath the water that you wouldn't even notice if you're standing there looking at it and some are these giant you know concrete structures so pretty much every water system River Creek whatever you want to call it is under control now that we have everything pretty much dammed up and we as humans control when the rivers flow when they don't flow when they're allowed to flood etc there's very few waterways left in fact in the United States in general that are actually naturally flowing anymore so one thing that is on your map is something called the Continental Divide and the Continental Divide here is shown as the margin of this these two areas that lower Basin an upper basin what's the Continental Divide that's supposed to be the place in the country where if you're a raindrop and you fall on the east side of the Continental Divide you will eventually flow to the east and into the Atlantic Ocean or maybe the Gulf of Mexico if you range up and you fall on this side of the Continental Divide you flow to the west and you end up in the Pacific or you end up in the Gulf of California okay ask Continental Divide well Continental Divide is a natural boundary between where water drains right but there are several instances where humans would like to take water from one side of the Continental Divide and bring it over to the other and Colorado is one of those places so Colorado is entitled to a portion of the Colorado River water that's part of the 1922 agreement where are all the people in Colorado well Denver is over here and the rivers are over here now before Denver they still wanted water over here for agricultural reasons right there's a lot of reasons you might want to have water over here but it's draining the wrong way so what do you do you well what they decided to do is they've decided to drill tunnels through the mountains in something called a trans mountain diversion trans mountain diversion means the natural flow of the water is it's going to go on one side of the mountain but what we're going to do is we're going to put in some tunnels and we're going to redirect it through the other side okay so if you go in Colorado you'll find some of these diversion tunnels in this water just literally going through a tunnel and through a mountain coming out the other side this is water that's supposed to go in the Colorado River Colorado decided that what they wanted to do with their Colorado River water is directed through under underground through the mountains and out the other side you know over towards in direction of Denver okay so all of those things are happening along the Colorado River we're building dams we got trans mountain diversions let's go back to our friends in California remember they were running out of water over and over and over and they were looking towards the Colorado and after 1922 and that treaty has passed they're now allowed to take water from the Colorado and so there's a little dam that's on your map called Parker dam and it backs up the Colorado to this lake called Lake Havasu and if you go there this is what it looks like okay so there's a lake havasu in the back and you notice there's water that kind of goes off to the left here that goes into a canal that's called the Colorado aqueduct and it takes water from the Colorado River across the desert and into Los Angeles this is what it looks like so it's a concrete lined ditch for the most part and the water goes across the desert and into modern-day Los Angeles as it makes its way there there are opportunities for farmers to get water out of that and this is one of the early promotional traveling exhibits for the water that's coming to Los Angeles and this helped build up the agricultural areas around there well if there is a worse place to build a city than Las Vegas it might be Phoenix okay so it's just as hot as Las Vegas or hotter it's far away from any bodies of water out in the middle Arizona and so Phoenix is also having its own water difficulties and just like in California and all these places we're talking about they've been running out of ground water so this is not a great graphic this as approximate decline in groundwater levels from 1940 to 1995 so this is we're looking at feet so - 150 - 200 - 50 that's how far the water groundwater level has dropped so what that means is if you lived saying in the bullseye you have to drill down 200 feet deeper in 1995 to hit water than you did in 1940 and what happens is as the groundwater goes down and down and down at some point it just becomes impractical to actually be able to drill a hole that deep and extract water the other problem that they're having in Phoenix is that they've been pumping so much groundwater out of the ground for so long that the ground is starting to sink and so here's a map of what we call a subsidence of of the ground so it says land surface displacement and the numbers are in centimeters so red means - 15 centimeters so this number here that's -12 that means the ground has literally sunk 12 centimeters between 1996 and the year 2000 right so in 4 years this is how much recorded subsidence how much did the ground sink right and so you see this whole area here has been sinking and as a result of the area sinking there are these really strange fissures opening up around Phoenix because the ground is all sinking as they suck up all this ground water and these big fissures have been opening up all around so they need water right and they are entitled to Colorado River water so in fact if you go back to Parker dam which is when we just saw there is another project another canal that takes water from that dam from the Colorado River goes all across the Arizona desert and goes into Phoenix and then actually about last 10 years or so they've extended it all the way to get into Tucson this is how Phoenix can continue to survive in one of the hottest driest places in the country called the central Arizona Project and here's what it looks like right just weird like this artificial river going through the desert and I like this picture because here we are in central Arizona and yet oh look we have golf courses how could that be you can see the the canal right next to it with all the water coming from the Colorado River another picture here okay well California is not done and in fact if you go further south so that we've been looking at Parker dam we go all the way down to there's another little tiny dam called an imperial dam and coming off of Imperial dam something called the All American canal I don't know exactly who named it but it's ironic that's right on the border with Mexico right right over here the all-american canal and you see it branches up there's a whole bunch of branches that come off of this and there's actually hundreds of them I just drew a few of them on here if you would look at a satellite image of this part of the world so there's Central Valley of California okay and it's kind of green and there are dams in Northern California that bring water down and irrigate a lot of the fields plus they have a lot of wells there and they didn't notice it gets super dry right this is super dry we're in the desert here and then notice down here there's a blob of green there and blob of green there on the zoom in this blob of green right here there's that's the international boundary border right here this is called the Imperial Valley this and this and if you look right there on if you can tell this or not yeah these are sand dunes and this is what it looks like okay so this is a picture taken from that spot right there okay this is how dry this area is supposed to be remember we're in the area of the Pacific subtropical high for a big portion of the year very dry very hot you see nothing green in this picture right but by bringing in water for this all-american canal you can see it right there comes right through here and then this whole Green Zone is one of the richest agricultural areas in the world very likely you have eaten something today that has come from this area called the Imperial Valley and here comes the all-american canal going through the sand dunes on its way through the desert until we get to this you can see you're super dry mountains in the distance very green fields up ahead and all of these green fields here are being watered with Colorado River water it's a perfect to grow crops it's sunny almost every day it's warm the soil is good you just don't have any water problem solved we've got the all-american canal bringing in water down from the Colorado River so that's what's happening here and my question then is okay if if the Colorado River comes down and crosses into Mexico and then goes in dumps into the Gulf of California after we divert it through all these different canals and all these different dams and what-have-you what what's left when it crosses the border and what's left when it goes into the Gulf of California so I'm gonna look we're gonna zoom in right in here here's the international border right there this is the path of the Colorado and I'm gonna zoom in here for you and I'm gonna zoom in a little bit more right here zoom in a little more that's the Colorado River notice there's no River right you can see where people in spending donuts out here in the in the dust the Colorado River has not reached the ocean since 1983 except for a couple exceptions to that where they released a little bit of water so the Colorado River a hundred percent of the river is used up by people so and all these different water projects were talking about the Colorado River split up all these different ways and if you remember when we started talking about this I said that 1922 is a record wet year and nobody gets the amount of water they want everybody's arguing about it none of it gets to the ocean anymore in that ecosystem from Neal from here South all the way in New Mexico that whole ecosystem around the river completely collapsed right because that all that water just got turned off so where the Colorado River has that 1922 agreement there was a similar agreement for the Rio Grande the Rio Grande compact and the Rio Grande itself starts out up here in Colorado then comes down through New Mexico and forms the border between Texas and Mexico right and so there's three American states that share the river and so there is a legal agreement as to how much each state gets from that River and so we also have several dams along the Rio Grande River and so if i zoom in a little bit so here comes the Rio Grande kinda makes this Big Bend as it goes into New Mexico here's one Cochiti if you're from around here you might be familiar with Cochiti dam here comes the river and the river continues down here and there's the earthen dam Cochiti dam was built in the 70s and initially it was supposed to be a much bigger reservoir than what you see in this picture in fact if you look at this it looks like it needs a lot more water in it partly that's the drought partly because when they built this they kind of screwed up and it turns out that if you put too much water in this reservoir over here it comes boiling out of the ground over here and that's because they didn't study the subsurface geology correctly so this dam this reservoir will never get any higher really than what you see in this in these pictures but people still use it and so Cochiti dam is is is is up here Albuquerque's right there and you need go all the way down here in the southern part of the state you can get to a couple of dams that are also pretty well known in particular Elephant Butte dam and Elephant Butte reservoir is actually a pretty old reservoir today after the Rio Grande compact its centrally like a holding pond for Texas meaning that Texas is legally entitled to a certain portion of the Rio Grande water and we as New Mexicans have to be able to deliver to them when they want that's part of the agreement so Elephant Butte is you know the reservoir itself is water that is waiting to go to Texas and then when they say we need them you know we need a hundred thousand acre feet we send it on down to them okay we've been in a drought situation for a long time and you can kind of see by the rings on this rock here that the lake level should be a lot higher than it is in fact it's only been a bit like a few percent full for the last several years now one of the problems is similar to Lake Mead here you have desert area it's hot it's dry low relative humidity lots of surface area right so how much are we losing in evaporation each year a lot right and if we're giving in legal trouble with Texas because if we don't have enough water to send the Texas and we can get fined we have to pay them and who wants to pay Texas so we have to have a way to prevent losing so much water and people have been working on like what what could we do to prevent all this evaporation and so this sounds crazy but one idea might be to cover the entire lake with like ping-pong balls now these are not ping-pong balls they're bigger this is a reservoir in California where they're they've been they've had a water crisis there forever and they decided that they would cover the entire lake with these plastic balls and it forms a layer and prevents evaporation rate so we might have to do something like that with a Elephant Butte someday now here's a magazine ad this is pretty low quality it's the only one I can find it says name a great American city on a large body of water and it shows a guy windsurfing out here and you look at those buildings in the background and I know it's a really crappy image but is there anything back there you might recognize because this is supposed to be a picture downtown Albuquerque and it may seem crazy to us now but there is a time when they were advertising people to please come here because we have so much water yeah we're in a desert but guess what underneath Albuquerque huge amounts of groundwater so much groundwater is as much as a great lake much as Lake Erie something like that well back then in the 80s they did some research and they decided that yes there's this huge reservoir of groundwater beneath us bigger it you know I guess at Lake Erie size body of water this is something called a cross-section and so you're you're you're cutting the earth in half and you're looking at it from the side here's the Sandia's northeast heights there's the river then there's West Mesa over here so Rio Rancho is over here right and this is has what we call a high vertical exaggeration so you know how was the distance here it's it's you know I don't know 10 miles but what is this distance right one mile from here to here so it's been vertically exaggerated much more than the horizontal scale so point is though they thought all of this was groundwater down here and they thought this because they draw the few they drilled a few wells and I kept finding groundwater and they're like oh this is great there's Lake Erie underneath the ground here but then they did some more studies after they published those magazine ads and they realized that oh actually it's a pretty small amount of groundwater and it's really really old like the water down here is like ten thousand years old it's left over from the last ice age and what's it like under say oh I don't know Rio Rancho a whole lot of nothing and so all these people are removing hid here Intel set up Rio Rancho and all that and they realized oh wait we don't actually have any groundwater in the groundwater that we do have we have to drill deeper and deeper and deeper and our wells are well over 500 feet deep to get to groundwater what are we going to do so on the original 1922 compact they are entitled to a portion of the Colorado River water even though as we said before the Colorado River does not go through the state of New Mexico but we're in the watershed so these three rivers and there's actually a whole bunch of little ones but these three are the larger ones these feed in to the San Juan which this is Navajo dam here but this is the San Juan River and that eventually dumps into the Colorado River and so legally we're entitled to a portion of the Colorado River water but we don't have to drill a hole and run a pipe all the way to the Colorado River what we can do is we can take water out of these rivers these tributaries that feed the Colorado River we can take water from their second problem how do we get it to Albuquerque where we need it well we're on the wrong side of the Continental Divide so here's the Continental Divide which is green on this map I believe it's pink on maybe on your map so the water naturally wants to run to the west we needed to get over here to the east so we're going to use a trick from Colorado's book and we're going to drill holes underneath the mountain and we're going to drop that water into the Chama River which is then going to flow down and dump into the Rio Grande which is then gonna take it all the way to Albuquerque this is called the San Juan Chama drinking water project okay so here's those three rivers that dump into the San Juan which dumps into the Colorado we're gonna put 26 miles of tunnels through the mountains and come out the other side in dump and there's a couple of little reservoirs over here along the Chama but eventually that water gets down and joins the Rio Grande and then makes its way first through Kochi and then eventually down to Albuquerque so this is what it looks like on your map I've got this red line here representing those tunnels San Juan Chama diversion okay so it's another train mountain diversion waters supposed to land on west of the Continental Divide but we're going to redirect it east through the divide and out the other side with where these tiny little dams are so unlike California we're not going to have a big long pipe that goes hundreds of miles unlike Arizona we're not going to have canal that goes hundreds of miles what we're going to do is we're going to have tunnels through the mountain but then we're going to use the natural rivers to take that water to Albuquerque here's where the water goes under the mountain into the tunnels or enters into the tunnels kind of here's where it comes out the other side here on Dam and then eventually it comes all the way down the Rio Grande and it gets to Albuquerque does anybody want to drink water out of the Rio Grande no they do not so part of this project is you also had to build a world-class water filtration system for this water because what's going to happen is that water comes down the Rio Grande and we just pump it out of the river and ultimately we want to drink this so here's where the what here comes the water down the Rio Grande there's a little dam you can't even see it it goes up and down it's right through here they raise it up when they wouldn't take water out they lower it down when they don't if their Dam is raised and the fish are coming by and they can't get around little problem we got a little fish passage where they can go around the dam and this is our water treatment facility and if you're familiar with Albuquerque it's kind of round the Renaissance area so there's like a home depot and stuff around there big old building but what they're doing is they're taking all kinds of stuff out of the water and making it drinkable and then from there it gets pumped through throughout the city there's a second system that takes river water that's not treated and it takes it to golf courses and parks all right so don't drink the water out of the sprinklers because it may be untreated river water so this was started you know this project took a long time to build and and alongside of that was this big citywide project to get people to save water so back in the mid-90s your average person in Albuquerque was consuming 250 gallons of water a day now that's mostly outdoor watering okay so a lot of this is convincing people that they don't need these big lush green lawns but there is a big campaign if you lived in Albuquerque you may remember there's lots of billboards about try not to you know you try to save water try not to take long showers etc etc and they got to by 2011 they got there to their goal of a hundred and fifty gallons per person per day which just still seems like a lot if you lined up 150 gallons of water we think I use that every single day that's all still seems like a lot compared to the rest of the world but it's a hundred gallons less than what we started and so there is a campaign for that and then we slowly switched off from the well water to this the San Juan Chama water and it wasn't immediate they keep increasing the proportion of San Juan Chama water so this is a couple tables of depth to the water table 538 542 that's how many feet down you'd have to drill to get to the water table in a couple of different areas in Albuquerque and so we see this kind of bump here over these waves that's the wet dry wet dry season and then we see about 2007 is when we start to transition over we start shutting these wells down and we see the water table starting to rebound and you know it's still 500 feet below the ground it's gonna take a really really long time for that to rebound all the way to where it used to be but point being because we switched over the San Juan Chama water our water tables are slowly starting to rise back up they'll take decades for them to get back to where they used to be so what allows us to stay here in Albuquerque San Juan Chama project that's what as actually allowing us to have water every time we turn that the faucets on every city in the southwest has a story right the reason Phoenix can exist where it does the reason Las Vegas can exist where it does the reason Los Angeles can exist where it does are because these very major what we call water projects dams and reservoirs and aqueducts and canals and tunnels through mountains and all these things so there's this huge network of these projects that are millions and millions and billions of dollars have been invested to make this work there's a financial cost there's an environmental cost right we lost Owens Lake we lost half a Mono Lake the Colorado River no longer reaches the ocean we've got dams all over the place so there's an environmental cost for all of this as well but this is just sort of basic introduction to the big water projects that allow us to live in the driest place in the country you
