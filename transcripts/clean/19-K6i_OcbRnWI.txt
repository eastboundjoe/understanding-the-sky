[0:03] [Music] hey this is Mel strong and this lecture is on the carbon cycle and more about greenhouse gases so this is a continuation of the greenhouse gas lecture so if you haven't watched that watch that one first and one of the things I'm going to be doing is talking about how carbon moves around in different reservoirs around the earth and so I'm gonna use some illustrations

[0:36] that I made that are on my website or on the learn if you're one of my students and I'm going to illustrate them feel free to print yours out and illustrate it the same way we talked about how last time the last lecture that there are several greenhouse gases there's a bunch of greenhouse gases and some of them are really strong but of all the ones that we worry about co2 is the number one gas that we're concerned about just because as humans reproduce more co2 than

[1:07] anything else by far okay and so we worry about methane we worry about nitrous oxide but we really worry about carbon dioxide because we just invent so much of it so that's what this lecture is about it's a mostly about co2 and so we talked about where the co2 is and in the atmosphere it's in the form co2 but it can actually that co2 molecule can

[1:37] move to different locations like maybe the ocean or maybe in a plant and it's no longer in the form of co2 it can change to a different molecule so we keep track of the carbon part of the co2 so we talked about the carbon cycle ultimately what we're trying to get at is that co2 is in the atmosphere and something is putting it into the atmosphere something is removing it from the atmosphere and it's being stored somewhere but it's not necessarily

[2:08] always in the form of co2 it could be some other carbon molecule okay so to start out with we're going to talk about something called the reservoirs of carbon okay this is where the carbon is okay where is it being stored around Earth and I'm going to use a unit here called the teragrams and we abbreviate it as TG oops

[2:40] okay a teragrams one teragrams is one times ten to the twelfth grams and what that would mean is you'd have to move the decimal over twelve places so for example if I had three teragrams that's the same thing as three times ten to the twelve grams which is the same thing as three one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve zeros right

[3:11] put some commas in there and the thing is this is such a giant number like you can't really wrap your mind around what that even means and it doesn't matter because the point of doing this is to show relative sizes of which cart which reservoirs are bigger and smaller but they're going to be in this unit of teragrams so for the numbers we're going to write down remember just add twelve zeros to everything if you wanted to write out the number okay so the carbon

[3:41] we are concerned about is the carbon in the atmosphere and it's in the form of co2 and that number is currently about 829 teragrams okay now by comparison if you added up all the carbon of all of the plants in the world you get about 600 teragrams okay so these are if you look these numbers up you'll get slight variations

[4:13] on this so these are kind of mutually agreed-upon numbers more or less right okay then in the soil because soil there's a lot of living and dead organic material in the soil and that a lot of carbon in it soil is about 2,000 teragrams okay now the ocean there's a lot of carbon in the ocean and it can be in a couple forms it could be in the form of dissolved gases so what

[4:50] that means is anytime you have gas sitting above liquid there is exchange between the two so there's co2 dissolved in the ocean just like co2 is dissolved say in a soda okay so some of it is in the form of that some of it is in the form of organic matter so in other words anything living in the ocean so dead or alive it's got carbon in it okay so add it all up you get about thirty eight

[5:20] thousand tera grams of carbon in the ocean now notice so far that that reservoir is so much bigger than anything else we've written up here okay that's just gigantic okay so there's a lot of carbon in the ocean now this diagram I have I made here shows carbonate rocks down here what does carbonate rocks carbonate a lot of times we have this compound called calcium

[5:51] carbonate and a lot of organisms have this in their shell so if you find a sea shell a clam shell for example it's going to be some version of calcium carbonate and there's that carbon that's in this molecule well when that animal dies sinks to the bottom of the ocean gets buried that carbon is now buried in this what we call carbonate rocks a lot of it is microscopic organisms that you actually can't see these are little microscopic plankton that foot in the

[6:22] ocean they have calcium carbonate skeletons even though they're single-celled microscopic organisms and they they die they settle at the bottom they make this this carbonate mud that gets buried and so a lot of carbon ends up getting buried in these carbonate rock now here's the kind of the confusing thing is that a lot of these carbonate rocks are no longer in the ocean because they're spread all over the planet on different continents where the ocean used to be so we don't have time to go through the geologic history of all this but there are many times in geologic

[6:55] history where for example the United States was covered in a shallow sea and so we have lots of carbonate rocks all over the country all over the world that are not in the ocean anymore even though they used to be in the ocean so if you live around Albuquerque you look up at the Sandia's you see these little horizontal stripes at the top those are carbonate rocks those used to be at the bottom of the ocean the ocean wasn't up there those rocks were down below sea level at one point okay add up all the

[7:26] carbon and all the carbonate rocks in the world and you get a pretty gigantic number about 80 million teragrams okay so so that number Dwarfs the one we just wrote so most of the carbon in the world is tied up in these rocks which again started out in the ocean but they may no longer be there and then the number two reservoir is carbon in the ocean itself

[7:56] now we also have in my picture here we get fossil fuels right and so we can break that up into let's see here we got coal it's about 3500 oil about 230 natural gas about 140 and other forms of fossil fuels about 250 and you add this

[8:29] all up and you end up with greater than about 4100 teragrams okay so let's compare these numbers by far biggest you know by far by far our biggest in the rocks but let's just leave those aside for the moment because that carbon is pretty much stuck there the carbon in the ocean is the biggest reservoir by are the carbon in the atmosphere is the one we worry about the most because this is related to the greenhouse effect notice how much carbon there is stored

[9:02] up in fossil fuels compared to the amount that's already in the atmosphere right so there's way more waiting underground that we as humans could potentially burn and use and turn into the atmosphere right turn into atmospheric carbon okay so this is sort of a simplified look at the reservoirs where the carbon actually is I'm going to start with another diagram just like this and we're going to talk about

[9:33] processes that are going going on here okay so for this next diagram we're going to do something about fluxes okay and a fox in this case fox is something that's in motion foxes in this case is carbon moving between reservoirs okay so the

[10:03] last one was reservoirs where is the carbon being stored now we're looking at how is the carbon being moved back and forth between some of these reservoirs and that's off what a fox is okay so we'll start with some that you probably already know so you learn for example back in your days in biology about photosynthesis okay

[10:36] so the general formula for photosynthesis the general reaction is plants take co2 and they take water and they take light and they produce glucose and oxygen right this is what photosynthesis is all about this glucose molecule if I were to if I were to write this out and balance it the way that a chemist would like I would have six co twos six waters and then I have this glucose

[11:18] molecule six oxygens okay so the six is just that's just to balance it when we talk about the carbon cycle I said earlier that we're following carbon around and we're worried about co2 in the atmosphere but it can change its form and be in other molecules other than co2 so here's an example what I mean by that the carbon was in the atmosphere as co2 okay and then the plant puts it into plants tough plant

[11:52] matter glucose our carbon just changed reservoirs it went from the atmosphere to the plant right so that's a flux we're taking out of the atmosphere we're putting it into some biomass okay so as long as a plant is photosynthesizing during the day it's removing co2 out of the atmosphere okay so what I'm going to

[12:24] do is draw these fluxes and different colors so vegetation I'm going to draw with a green arrow and what's coming in from photosynthesis is about a hundred and twenty three tera grams per year okay so this is photosynthesis okay now the plant continues to live when the Sun

[12:57] is is is not up because plants like us have to respire so even though they are producing oxygen during the day and they're using up so you know that point co2 out of the atmosphere during the day there's a secondary process that's going on twenty-four hours a day and it only goes on it's the only process that goes on during the night but the punts are doing it 24 hours a day and it's called respiration respiration is what we would call breathing okay we're

[13:28] breathing in oxygen for letting us co2 deaths respiration we do it animals do it plants do it and and so if we write out that formula for respiration it's basically the opposite of what we just wrote for photosynthesis okay so we would have the glucose plus oxygen we'll

[13:59] get some heat out of this reaction some co2 and some in some some water vapor and and so now what's happening is the carbon that is in the glucose is being transferred back into the carbon that's now in the air right so this is this was in the plant this is in the air this is in the air okay this is in the air right so photosynthesis we take the carbon out

[14:31] we put it into glucose respiration we take the carbon out of the glucose we put it back in the air it's basically backwards now we're doing the same thing even though we're not plants we are still taking a carbon from glucose and we are exhaling co2 all right okay so but just to focus on plants for a second so what that means is there is this for the synthesis that's removing carbon from the air but then there's respiration that is putting it back so

[15:09] this is plant respiration okay so 50 teragrams is going back out into the atmosphere so the net that plants are doing here is there is they're bringing in more carbon than they are producing as long as the plant is it's growing so this is a worldwide average for all the vegetation on earth okay okay now speaking of respiration down here in

[15:40] the soil there is a lot of things that are living in the soil I mean have the root systems are respiring you get microorganisms that are respiring so there's respiration going on in the soil and that is contributing carbon to the atmosphere as well so I'll use a purple color here and that is about 70 point for teragrams per year also so let me

[16:14] just put down soil this is respiration and fire so fire is the same reaction this is also the same reaction for fire except fire it happens faster but when you're burning a plant you're taking the carbon from the plant matter reacting with oxygen getting co2 and water vapor okay so respiration and fire is the same

[16:44] reaction just respiration as slow fire is really fast so if you take all of the naturally-occurring respiration in the soil and all the naturally occuring fire you get about 70 point four teragrams per year going out back into the atmosphere well now you've got I've got a little farmer here and I can't fire and whatnot and this is to simulate what humans do we call this a land-use right so if we cut down trees we put up a

[17:15] parking lot we build houses we make roads we pile fields we burn things down that's collectively called the land-use okay and land-use there's actually we could break it down further like if I'm a farmer and I and that plant crops those crops we'll pull down the co2 out of the atmosphere but when I take everything to an account so the planting of things plus the burning of things well you know all of that combined

[17:46] it turns out that we add about 1.1 tera grams per year and this is called land use okay land use all right we will come back to this in a second let's talk about the ocean so one of the things I said about the ocean a minute ago is that there is gases that are going both

[18:17] directions in the ocean so you have gases going into the ocean and you have gases leaving the ocean so I'm gonna call this gas exchange and so you have

[18:47] the you have the experience that if you take say a soda and you twist the top and then see what two comes bubbling out right that co2 is dissolved into the liquid right so you can take gases and you can dissolve them into liquids and in or pour glass water set it down come back the next day you'll see little bubbles on the inside right that's gas that is coming back out of the liquid so this is happening with the ocean there's gas going into the

[19:18] ocean and there's gas coming back out of the ocean and what's going into the ocean is about 92.3 teragrams per year and what's leaving the ocean is about 90 tera grams per year okay so there's a little there's a little more going in and there is coming back out and we'll come back to that in a minute and then

[19:49] finally we have our fossil fuels here as we burn fossil fuels - like we said in the last lecture mostly generate electricity transportation we are adding about 7.8 teragrams per year okay all right so we talk about sources and sinks what does that mean

[20:22] sources is where we're adding co2 to the atmosphere that's a source a sink means we're taking it and we're putting it away somewhere underground or in Iraq or in a plant and that's a sink okay so we've got sources and sinks all right going each direction so if we and by the way this is simplified there are there are many other smaller ones I'm just trying to paint the big picture here so the next diagram is going to be what is

[20:52] the net result what is the net result of all of this all right so for this one we're looking at the result of the previous previous diagram of fluxes so if I take all those foxes the sources and the sinks and I do the math and we see where ultimately are the changes occurring overall every year there's

[21:26] about 2.6 tera grams of carbon going into the world's vegetation okay so every year that goes by we're adding more carbon to the world's forests to our farms anything that's growing okay now if you remember from West's from so just a minute ago we were looking at the last diagram we had over here that there was two arrows going up and down from

[21:57] the ocean and the net is that there is about 2.3 tera grams per year going into the ocean all right so there's gas exchange some goes that some goes into the ocean some out of the ocean but there's a little more going in than there is coming out and so the net is that 2.3 teragrams per year are going into the ocean we'll talk more about that in a second and then the atmosphere is gaining about four tera

[22:37] grams per year okay now this is the number this is this is the thing that we're worried about the most okay we're worried about what is the effect of these increasing co2 levels right and that's what you've been reading about in my class this is what we're going to keep talking about but let's talk about this one first what does it mean to keep adding this much carbon into the into

[23:07] the ocean every year all right what does that do so one of the things that it does is if I take carbon dioxide and I react it with water I will get a compound h2 co3 which goes by the name of carbonic acid this is a weak acid co2

[23:42] in the presence of water turns into a weak acid if you had a really bubbly soda and you're trying to drink it out of a glass or something you may have had the experience once in a while that your eyes burn a little bit like when it's super fizzy that's carbonic acid so every year we're dumping 2.3 teragrams remember that means times you add 12 zeros to the end of this is going into the ocean and that co2 that goes into the ocean you may have read in our

[24:13] textbook that it's a good thing that the ocean is taking up some of the co2 because that means there's less of it for the atmosphere but it's a bad thing because we're making the ocean more acidic the oceans or overtime or becoming more and more acidic because of this now why is that a problem so let me show you a couple pictures so when you think of a coral reef this is probably what you think of it there in Showell

[24:43] usually warm water a lot of very colorful organisms and I want you to notice that it's in pretty shallow water here maybe a meter or two below the ocean's surface and there's a lot of different organisms that live on a coral reef so we see we've got CNN CNN amis here we've got starfish we got sea urchins with all kinds of things but they're all living on this big mound in the background and the mound itself was built by these little organisms called

[25:13] corals and these look like plants but they're actually colonies each one of these has a bunch of little tiny individuals living inside and the coral is each one of these little animals and they secrete a calcium carbonate shell essentially that binds them all together until like this giant apartment complex and each one of these guys is an individual so corals are related to

[25:43] jellyfish they have these little steamed tentacles they sit there they do this waiting for something to flow into their mouth there are pretty simplistic organism but they're important because this calcium carbonate a house that they're making forms the basis for work all those other organisms that you saw earlier are going to live now even though corals are animals they have living inside their tentacles these little single-cell photosynthetic

[26:14] bacteria called zooxanthellae okay so this is what they look like so there's one of the tentacles of the coral and he sees all the green spots each one of those green spots is a single cell for the synthetic organism that generally cannot survive on its own outside of the coral so this is kind of confusing because the coral is an animal but living inside the animal are these little plant like things that are for this in and they're producing energy that the coral itself is using okay so they have

[26:46] this symbiotic relationship the nothing is going to eat the zones in thely because they're sitting inside the stinging little tentacle here and the coral itself gets some energy from them in order for this to work the coral has to be about a meter below the ocean surface right so if the coral gets out of the water - huh you have gets out of the water that's not good the coral dies if it the water is too deep there's not enough for the synthesis that's also a

[27:16] problem so they'd like to be about a meter or so below the surface well when a coral gets stressed for reasons that not I don't think are totally understood the the coral will reject all of those zones and thely and they turn white and this is called coral bleaching so this coral right now is stressed what would stress it higher temperatures will stress it or if the ocean becomes more acidic that will stress it out and so as

[27:46] we have been making the ocean more and more acidic and warmer and certain in some respects we're seeing more and more bleaching of corals and so in some places we see this big extent of coral bleaching now these these corals again this is the first stage on their way out so they will reject the zone cynth le if conditions improve then they will come back and things are okay if conditions continue to deteriorate

[28:17] then the corals will die okay so not all these corals in these pictures are necessarily dead yet here's some before and after pictures of corals that are now bleaching and we see big chunks of coral reefs around the world starting to do this this is the bad sign it tells us that the oceans are now becoming inhospitable for the corals and the corals form the basis for these coral reef ecosystems here's one that's

[28:47] finally dead so this one has bleaching and then conditions never got better and the corals finally died here and now they kind of turn this dark color so when you see here if I go forward here's an example where some coral this is the coral is bleaching just starting to happen you see a big we Qing event here the following year and then later the corals are all dead and turning this dark color so that is one

[29:21] of the reasons why we worried about the amount of carbon going into the ocean we're producing carbonic acid that isn't is stressing out the corals the corals form the basis for these coral reef ecosystems so we're seeing these big bleaching events so a hundred years ago or so scientists thought that we might be adding carbon to the atmosphere but no one had actually measured it and so people speculated that you know we think

[29:53] today people talk about global warming like is this new idea but you can find scientific papers a hundred years ago where they were speculating that this could happen but we didn't really have any good measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so finally in the 1950s a guy by the name of Charles Keeling decides that he's going to build a machine that's gonna measure carbon dioxide and he's gonna build a machine that takes a measurement like every day and we're gonna start monitoring it over the long period and see if it changes so in order to do this

[30:25] he needed to find a spot that was away from cities that was pretty you know hopefully up in the atmosphere he wanted to get them the most the cleanest air sample he could and so he decides that he's going to do this on the Big Island of Hawaii and so Big Island of Hawaii has two volcanoes manalo Mauna Kea they're both over 11,000 feet tall and so at that time there wasn't a road up to the top Ernie no electricity or anything like that this is a this is a pretty big project but what he managed

[30:56] to do starting in 1957 is he built an instrument and he put it on the top or near the top of one of these volcanoes mono Lola and here picture what it looks like up there you're actually above there's a cloud layer that forms over the ocean this is stratocumulus so we talked about earlier in the semester you're above the strata cumulus on most days and this is a sign that's up there today so that's at 11,000 141 feet and right now there's a

[31:28] lot of equipment up there but back then this the very first thing that they were measuring was co2 so he builds his machine he turns it on in 1957 and he lets it run and it runs a couple of years and he looks at his data for a couple of years and he finds that there is this very odd pattern where the the co2 goes up and then it goes back down again up and back down again up and back down again but as it's doing that there

[32:00] is this very slow rise over time okay so we're going to talk about this this graph is called the Keeling curve there is no Nobel Prize in meteorology or climatology or environmental science or earth science but if there was if there was ever a Nobel Prize in this field this graph would get it first okay it's such an important graph it actually has its own bronze plaque and I don't know of any other graph that has its own

[32:31] bronze plaque okay the Keeling curve so we're gonna study the Keeling curve because it is so fundamentally important to environmental science and what we're talking about here okay so we're gonna have a look at the Keeling curve and on the axis on the x axis is time and on the y axis is co2 now you'll see for

[33:03] example on this one it says parts per million okay so there's not much co2 in the atmosphere but we have a way of expressing it so if I had three parts per hundred okay we would call that percent can we use this symbol right so the math would be three over 100 okay that's percent there's another symbol

[33:36] that you probably not familiar with where if you had three parts per thousand that's called per mil and it has two of the circles and you would do it you do three divided by thousand okay if I have three parts per million the way I write

[34:06] that is 3 ppm and if I did the math 3 divided by a million okay so on this graph that we are going to look at here the y-axis is usually in ppm parts per million all right so a couple years after Charles Keeling turns on his machine and he starts to get data this is the this

[34:37] is what he sees this up-down pattern I might try to focus and he also sees that this this up-down pattern is gradually increasing and he knows that this is pretty significant so there's two things going on and we got to separate them out first is what's causing the up-down pattern

[35:07] okay now on earth we have what we call deciduous trees these are trees that in the spring they bud out and as you start to grow there's a growing season the leaves get bigger in order for the leaves to get bigger the plant has to pull co2 out of the atmosphere okay so throughout the summer the deciduous plant the sigils tree whatever it is is growing growing growing growing and is pulling carbon dioxide out of the air

[35:38] and it's making you know from photosynthesis so then coming to the fall the deciduous tree loses its leaves the leaves follow to the ground now that carbon that it took out of the atmosphere a lot of it is now laying on the ground in the form of dead leaves and all the microorganisms are munching away and digesting that and that carbon goes back up into the atmosphere so in a

[36:08] normal year for a particular if you think of just one deciduous tree in the spring and into the summer the growing season it's taken co2 out of the air in the fall in the winter it's actually adding co2 back into the air because it's dumped off all of its leaves okay so now imagine a set of one plant doing that imagine all the plants in the world doing that so because the seasons are

[36:38] reversed when we have summer in the or let's say spring in the northern hemisphere our plants in the northern hemisphere are starting to bud out and they are sucking down co2 out of the atmosphere but at the same exact time the plants and the southern hemisphere are experiencing fall and their leaves are falling off and that's adding co2 to the atmosphere so the two hemispheres the plants and the two hemispheres balance each other out but when you look at the two

[37:10] hemispheres what you see is that there's way more land in the northern hemisphere than there is in the southern hemisphere okay so what does that mean that means that there's more plants in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere so that means that when we're talking about competing seasons then nor the plants in the northern hemisphere are the ones that actually are in control of the carbon in the atmosphere because there's more of them so even though

[37:40] these you know if the hemispheres were perfectly balanced if there was the same amount of land in each and the same amount of plants in each as one was losing its leaves and the other was budding out leaves the two effects would cancel each other out they don't cancel each other out because we've got more plants in the north okay so if we could so thinking about that then if we consider this this up and down is being controlled by what the plants in the

[38:12] north are doing right so let say we'll start in the fall and the leaves fall off in the fall and they fall on the ground and that returns co2 to the atmosphere so that means that where we see co2 increasing that's starting in the fall and it continues throughout the winter in the northern hemisphere in the northern hemisphere okay so the seasons

[38:44] I'm writing are northern hemisphere okay so co2 gets returned gets returned and then we finally get to the spring and things start to bud out and as they do they start pulling co2 out of the atmosphere so we get into spring and as we go down this way this is the growing season and into the

[39:17] summer and then it repeats again fall into winter etc so this up and down that we're seeing that's due to plants and it's due to the plants in the northern hemisphere because we have more of them okay so that's the first thing Keeling notices but the second thing Keeling notices is perhaps more important than that which is that this whole pattern is on the way up and he realizes even after

[39:51] just a few years of data that this slope is due to us to humans burning fossil fuels so this is the human co2 contribution that's adding on top of what the plants are doing so you can kind of think of it like this if there was a world with no humans we would

[40:22] expect that it would do this it would cycle with the seasons of the northern hemisphere because of the because again of the plants but it's doing this instead because every year we are adding more to the atmosphere and so every year we

[40:55] progressively add more and more and more so here are some data from Hawaii just the last few years okay and you can see there's this the red the up and down those are the seasons and then this black line is sort of a mathematical average over time and I go forward one more here so here's for example just the last few

[41:26] measurements of the last few days when I write before I recorded this we have surpassed 400 parts per million now for a couple of years and as seasons as you know right now we're going into the northern hemisphere spring so we should actually expect some of these numbers to start to go back down here a little bit this is what it looks like today up there there's a lot of instrumentation they're measuring all kinds of stuff up

[41:56] here that at the center for stratospheric research is what they called and so I actually went there a few years ago to do some research in my own and this building right here that's the building that has that bronze plaque on it so here's another picture of it's this right in here and this is all this is really awful in mr. the public is just scientists you know super nerds

[42:26] walking around here but if you go inside this building this is what it looks like and there's this box right here in this really old chart recorder and you open it up and there's a piece of plexiglass here and this is one of the original of this is one of the original machines that Charles Keeling made is technically not the first one because the very first one I guess got taken apart but it's essentially the first one so all the

[42:56] scientists they are I go oh my god they get so excited you can see my reflection taking a picture of it in there but this is the first a co2 monitor since Charles Keeling put that in on the top of Hawaii we've been putting them in all over the world and it's the same pattern everywhere it's that same up-down but climbing co2 so one thing we'd like to know as climate scientists is how much greenhouse gas was in the atmosphere in

[43:26] the past whether it be co2 or methane or whatever so we have killings machine that's been taking measurements since 1958 but how much co2 is in the atmosphere say 100 years before that or 100 years before that so there's a couple ways you can do it some people have found sealed bottle old bottles with air in it and analyze that so maybe you find an old bottle from you know 150 years ago you can analyze the air in

[43:57] there but further back you go the harder it is and so one of the ways that we do it is if you find a place that has been frozen consecutively without ever experiencing any melting that you can actually find trapped atmospheric gas in the ice so snow itself fresh snow so if you're a skier think of like some fresh powder that's like 90% air but then

[44:28] after the snow sits on the ground for a while it very slowly starts to recrystallize and that fluffy snow kind of gets gritty and granular and then eventually it turns into something called fern and if it's a place that never ever actually melts what'll happen is those nice fluffy snowflakes eventually turn into solid ice and the air that fell as snow gets encapsulated as a little bubbles so

[45:02] this is what it looks like so the little bubbles in this ice our old trapped pockets of atmosphere the atmospheric gases from when this ice first formed so this piece of ice is a thousand years old then the bubbles in there are little samples of thousand-year-old atmosphere so this only works if you have a place that never gets above the freezing point right stays frozen all year round so

[45:32] there's two main places that we can do this one is Antarctica and the middle Antarctica never melts and middle of Greenland now there's also some places you can go and do this on the continent where you have glaciers year-round those glaciers are disappearing but people are still trying to sample them so if you want to do this you get yourself some Russians because they really like the cold they go out to a place like Antarctica

[46:03] and they set up these geodesic dome tent things and they drill down into the ice so this is specially designed drill to drill down into the ice and remove what we call an ice core so they're trying to recover the ice without destroying it and this is what I score looks like so they'll drill down thousands of feet and keep removing ice and the ice that they remove when they pull it out and polish

[46:36] it you can see the individual years so in a place like Antarctica you only get a couple centimeters of snow a year but it just never melts and so each band is a year and the bubbles that are preserved in each band have a little sample of the atmosphere from that time when they were that ice formed so what you can do is if you drill down enough you can go down thousands of years you can extract air thousands of years ago

[47:07] and they store this ice in these giant warehouses that are kept below freezing so each one of these tubes has an ice core in it now let's say your site I climate scientists you know I I would like to find the atman samples of the atmosphere 50,000 years ago so what you do is you go to one of these facilities and you find ice that's 50 thousand years old and there's a whole set with saws and everything everything in this warehouse is kept below freezing and you cut out the ice you're

[47:39] interested in and you seal it in glass and then you melt it and then the bubbles come out and it's sealed in this glass that you put it in and then you extract the gas out and you analyze it so using this technique we can actually recreate the atmosphere all the way back several hundred thousand years so Antarctica has been below freezing for several hundred thousand years so in this graph what they've done is they've

[48:09] reconstructed co2 parts-per-million and here is today now this graph has made a few years ago so today the co2 level is higher it's kind of like up in here now but they went back now this graph goes back says 400,000 years and then it says for 650,000 years atmospheric co2 was never higher than this level so we can with Antarctica we can actually go back

[48:41] pretty close to a million years before you run out of ice when we extract the ice and we analyze the gases what we find is that for the past million years we've never seen co2 as high as it is today ok now you see these big patterns right so here the co2 was pretty low we were in what we would call an ice age here the co2 was higher so that so earth was warmer then we've got another Ice Age warmer these are natural cycles and

[49:14] there's changes in the Earth's orbit that caused this okay so we're not worried about that like this is we know what does this what we're worried about is this that we now have more co2 in the atmosphere than the earth is seen in the last million years or maybe more and the question is what is the earth going to do how is the atmosphere going to respond we can also look at other greenhouse gases so this is years ago

[49:45] I think it got cut offs it's time to forked 2005 when this was made and they're looking at methane and now they're looking at ppb parts per billion they're getting it out of the ice so you can see from about ten thousand years ago to pretty close to the present day there wasn't a lot of variation in methane remember methane is a pretty strong greenhouse gas there's not much of it in the atmosphere but it's a pretty strong gas and then starting there and they're zooming in here is what they're doing starting about you

[50:16] know 1900 or so we see a big uptick in methane so methane is probably higher now than it's been in the past million years or if you remember from the last lecture another a strong greenhouse gas is nitrous oxide again parts per billion there's not a lot in the atmosphere that you see some error bars so it's it's there's more uncertainty in the measurements but again back ten thousand years ago the amount of nitrous oxide stayed

[50:46] pretty constant until we get to again about late 1800s 1900 and it starts to take off again that's higher now than it's been in the last hundred thousand year our last million years or so so one of the things they've done is reconstructed what we call the pre-industrial atmospheric concentration so we talked about the industrial age that roughly correlates to like 1800 ish or 1850 different definitions of industrial revolution but sort of when

[51:18] humans started with steam engines and burning a lot of coal C 1850 we'll just use that as a number co2 is about 280 parts per million so in other words if the industrial revolution didn't happen in all the things that humans have done since then didn't happen we'd expect the atmosphere to have about 280 parts per million and as we just saw a few slides ago it's currently over 400 they've also

[51:48] established some other ones methane nitrous oxide few others but these numbers here the pre-industrial amounts that is what the concentrations should be and then these numbers here are what they currently are and actually this is already obsolete so they're even higher than what is what is shown here so in conclusion whether you look at co2

[52:19] or methane or nitrous oxide we've got more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere right now then the earth is seen in the past about million years maybe more what's going to happen and the short answer is we're not totally sure so we know that there are natural variations in greenhouse gases so we saw the co2 go up and down in the past but it's never been as high as it is today so one of the questions is what

[52:50] is the climate system going to do and we're going to talk more about this in the future lecture but one of the big worries is we're not totally sure what is going to do we know things are warming up we can predict how they're going to warm more in the future but could there be something else that's going to happen and we'll talk more about that in a future lecture all right thanks

[53:26] you
