[0:04] hey this is Mel and in this lecture I'm going to be talking about some of the evidence for global warming and so in this class you've been reading this book and so far you've read parts one two three and four we've got exam number three coming up and an exam number three we're going to be focusing on among other things the evidence for global warming now you've been reading about other

[0:34] things and some of that some of those other things will be in exam number four so what I want to do in this lecture and the one that follows is go through some of these diagrams the charts the maps that have been in your book and some of the concepts and try to explain in more detail what they're talking about here and hopefully they'll make a little more sense so to start here's an example of a graph that was in your book and yours is

[1:07] very similar to this it may not look quite exactly like it but on the y-axis that says temperature difference compared to the 1951 to 1980 mean and there's a bunch of red dots here and each dot by itself represents a global temperature for for a whole year compared to a 30-year average okay so there's a lot kind of embedded in this and I want to make sure we all

[1:37] understand what they're what they're showing here okay so first of all each red dot imagine how complicated it would be to try to come up with one number to represent the temperature of the earth you've got all the different locations you've got the different seasons and you throw all that together over a whole year and you come up with one number and that's not easy to do now with modern records it's pretty easy with satellite data we have satellites that can measure

[2:07] the temperatures of the surface of the earth and come up with a number pretty easily when you go further back in time because it gets harder you've got to rely on weather stations on the ground and weather stations on ships and buoys and it's you know you have to kind of integrate all these measurements and people have argued about exactly the best way of doing it and we don't have time to really dig into the details about how that is done except we kind of have to accept that they know what they are doing when they came up with these with

[2:37] these numbers so that's the first thing is every red dot is one number for the whole planet for the whole year the other thing that they've done instead of saying that the global average temperature is a particular number like 54 degrees Fahrenheit or whatever it is they're not doing that they're comparing it to a 30-year average now remember we said in an earlier lecture that 30 years is a number that we use for calculating climate we have this term climate norm

[3:08] climate normal it's a 30-year average so what they've done here is they've taken all the temperatures for the world from 1951 to 1980 so that's a 30-year average and they average the whole thing together and came up with one number whatever that is let's just say it's 54 degrees Fahrenheit and then they said okay how much did this one vary compared to that average now they're doing maitland degree centigrade so the numbers above zero so this dot right

[3:38] here would be 0.2 degrees centigrade above the 1951 to 1980 average okay so between 1951 which would be right about here in 1980 which would be right about there these Nevers are bouncing back and forth they're hovering around the zero mark because that's how they actually defined this graph they're comparing it to this 30-year average so the numbers that are in that 30 year time period are going to

[4:09] be pretty close to zero on the other hand you have these numbers that are negative and what that means is that these years were colder than this 30 years so it's in my opinion it's a very confusing way to show data like this but this is how it's done so we kind of have to get in the mind of a climate scientist they always want to compare something to a 30-year average so they picked this segment for their 30 years and they're calculating each year and

[4:39] they're comparing it to that 30 year average so negative just means we were colder than this 1950 to 1980 average and the positive numbers means that we're warmer compared to that 1950 the 1980 average okay but the actual number isn't so important as the trend so a big idea that I want you to get out of this class is that when we talk about climate change we're looking for long-term

[5:10] trends in the data okay that's a huge idea here so if you go to year to year right so if I just pick some some arbitrary year here and I say well here the temperature relatively was relatively low it jumps up and then it goes back down and back up and back down and year to year it doesn't show that it's actually getting warmer every single year and this is a huge misconception some people say well

[5:41] global warming must mean it's getting warmer every year but what this graph shows is no it's not getting warmer every year this year right here was colder than the year before right and so some climate change critics or global warming critics would say a hot seat global warming is not real because we actually have years that were colder than the prior year therefore it can't be getting warmer but that's not what we mean by global warming what we mean is

[6:11] that if you look at this graph what's the overall trend the overall trend as things are going up and up and up and yes there are year two your average of changes why for example do we have these white you know why was it warm this year and then dip down it the year after a lot of this has to do with El Nino La Nina so an El Nino you're exposing a big part of the equatorial Pacific warm water to the atmosphere that helps warming the planet a little bit in along

[6:42] Nina you expose a lot of cold water along the equatorial region that makes the pine a little bit cooler so a lot of this kind of crazy up-and-down is long Nina El Nino we kind of in our minds have to kind of filter that out and say okay yeah there's a lot of crazy up and down but what's the overall trend and the overall trend is higher and higher temperatures okay it's worth pointing out there is something weird happening here and we did talk about this in the book a little bit we were

[7:15] you can kind of kind of get from this that from about you know 1910 or so onwards we're warming and then in the 40s we kind of cool off a little bit until the 70s and we start to get warmer again right well why did this cooling happen this is air pollution the air pollution around the planet got so bad it was actually reflecting sunlight and cooling things down and you remember in a previous lecture in the 1970s we passed the Clean Air Act in this country and that helped clean the air quite a

[7:47] bit in other countries around the world we didn't really talk about them but started to also pass similar laws so we see that the atmosphere is actually starting the cleaner after 1970 and that pollutions going away and we see the warming then coming back as a result okay so big picture here global warming doesn't mean it's getting warmer every year it means that the overall trend is increasing temperatures the fact that you have a year that's colder than the

[8:17] year before does not invalidate global warming it's just it is some noise and the data that's what we say also they do climate scientists typically do this funny thing where they compare it to a 30-year average so if you're colder than that 30 year average you end up with negative numbers and that kind of like if you're not used to these coming graphs it doesn't make a lot of sense okay another type of graph that you saw was looking at the warming in your book

[8:52] so this is on page 35 and it says changing global surface temperature 1901 to 2012 and it says under that notice that the pattern of warming is not uniform land regions for example have warm more than the oceans okay so there's a couple things I really want you to get from this first of all this gray how it's gray down here that's gray up here that means that we haven't had temperature records that are robust

[9:22] enough for long enough to be able to save for scientific certainty what's happening now in a minute I will show you some graphs where we we do kind of know what's happening here but for this one since nineteen no you know back in 1901 there weren't a lot of people taking temperatures in the North Pole or the Antarctic right so we can't say a hundred percent for a certain what's changed there and so that's why this is great that doesn't mean there's no warming it just means we don't have records of it also you'll see some other

[9:52] places in here with this in gray like in the middle of Africa again 1901 nobody's taken temperatures in the middle of Africa and making really nice records so one of the big points that I want you to get from this is that the warming is not distributed evenly you see a lot more of it on the continents than you do in the oceans and you see a lot more of it in the northern hemisphere than you do in the in the south so that's one thing I can just notice the other thing is if

[10:24] you look at the scale down here they're looking for changes over this you know one hundred and twelve year period blue means it got a little bit colder in that hundred years and all these other colors means that it's gotten warmer and you'll notice that right up here there is a little blob of blue which means that in fact there's a couple little specks over here too and so what this means is that the the world is actually there's a

[10:55] couple places where the world has gotten a little bit cooler in the last hundred years according to this now a climate change critic will say aha see that global warming must not be true because if the world was getting warmer then you wouldn't expect places to actually be getting colder okay so this is another misconception about global warming global warming does not mean the entire globe is getting warmer even though that's kind of the implication so what global warming actually means is

[11:27] that if you mathematically average this whole thing right take all the colors into account and you were to add it all up what would then that result be right if you look at all the oranges and yellows and Red's yeah there's a couple little specks here where it's a little bit blue right and those are those are where it's gotten cooler but if you averaged this whole thing the globe was definitely getting warmer it's a mathematical average now why would it actually beginning colder in places like

[11:57] how why would that even happen so there was a couple reasons one is you could have it shift in ocean currents so if you remember the Gulf Stream the Gulf Stream comes out here and it takes warm water to the north well that Gulf Stream is becoming weaker with the time which means it's pumping less warm water to the North Atlantic and therefore this region up here is getting cooler here's another version of this map that is not in your book but

[12:28] it's similar to and this one is a little different what they're doing is they are again comparing out the temperatures today to a 1951 to 1980 mean right so they're taking a 30-year average and they're looking at temperatures today am i today I mean I think this is a couple years old now and comparing how the earth is now compared to that thirty year period in the past right so if you do that this is more modern this doesn't

[12:58] go all the way back to 1901 so we have more modern records and we see that a lot of the warming the majority of the warming is up in the north okay up in the above the Arctic Circle we also see there's more warming over the continents in the oceans and we also see more zones here of cooling right there's more cooling here in the oceans and again ye you know does this invalidate global warming no if I mathematically average this whole picture together I still get a number

[13:29] that's positive right it's the whole thing on average is getting warmer even though there's places that are getting cooler so again why would places beginning cooler there's several things that could be at play here you could have changing ocean currents you could also have changing patterns of storms so think about the mid-latitude cyclones if you change the direction of a mid-latitude cyclone so let's say you increase the likelihood that the path of the mid-latitude cyclone will come down

[13:59] here this region down here will have more cloudy days and have in it we'll end up with lower temperatures so when you see these zones out in the oceans that are cooler doesn't mean the Earth's getting cooler it just means we're probably changing directions of storms or directions the ocean currents which are changing zones out in the ocean but not necessarily changing the overall pattern around the earth in terms of the overall temperature change okay so this

[14:29] is a map that's not in your book but it's pretty important and what we're looking at is warming and this map is actually for the past few decades and we're looking at how much the atmosphere has changed temperature so this says troposphere up here and what we're looking at really is what how the temperature is about 10 kilometers above our head has changed okay that's what they're showing so the colors are similar as the other maps red means that it's getting warmer blue means it's gotten colder white means it hasn't

[15:00] changed grey means we don't any data okay so notice that there's some big differences between this one and that and the last maps we were looking at so one difference is you don't see the big contrast so much between the continents and the oceans right you still kind of notice more warming appeared to the north but the big thing I want you to pay attention to on this map is how we have a band that's right through here

[15:31] and we have another band that's right through here okay so in other words all of this pink has been getting warmer but the areas that have B have been getting especially warmer are centered kind of right through here and right through here so I want you to think about something that we talked about in a previous lecture that kind of lines up with this and this and if you can remember what we talked about in global circulation in that lecture as we

[16:03] talked about how air rises along the ITCZ which is kind of near the equator but then it sinks back down about 30 degrees north 30 degrees south those are called the subtropical highs and they change with the seasons okay well great for here that's about 30 degrees south and right up here is about 30 degrees north so what we see for example is like right through here this is one of the subtropical highs and we see that it's

[16:35] gotten even warmer than the surrounding area this is where we expect to find the Bermuda high it's gotten even warmer than usual this is where we expect to find the Pacific subtropical high it's gettin warmer than usual and even here over the continent is also part of the Pacific subtropical high sometimes so what does this mean sinking air warms okay we talked about that a long time ago if I have the Hadley cell air rises at the equator

[17:07] sync song 30 degrees right that's the whole the whole Hadley cycle if I make the Headlee cell bigger and stronger I have more air rising at the equator which means I have more air sinking at 30 degrees which means I have more of the compressed air warming than I did before okay so so in a you know in a world where there's no global warming okay we we expect air to rise at the

[17:39] equator we expect air to sink at 30 degrees and as it sinks down at worms but that's it it's reaching up state of equilibrium right well this is what this is saying is that those Hagley cells are getting stronger they're getting bigger and they're getting stronger and even though it's getting warmer everywhere we're seeing especially large amounts of warming where the Headlee cells are coming down and making those subtropical highs you're compressing more and more air

[18:10] coming down which makes it warmer at this ultimately will make it warmer and drier at the surface okay so why would this happen if you mark the whole planet remember why is air rising at the ITCZ in the first place that's the warmest part of the earth that's where the trade winds converge so if you warm up the whole planet this part along the equator at the surface is getting warmer more air is rising more air goes up to the

[18:40] stratosphere more air sinks down about 30 degrees north south and when you get stronger subtropical highs so what does that mean for us well remember we are living under the influence of the Pacific subtropical high especially in the winter and the spring in the fall right it moves out of the way in the summer but the rest of the year it really dominates our weather us in New Mexico in the southwest so if that gets stronger then what does that mean for

[19:11] our weather that means that our Pacific subtropical high will be getting stronger we'll see more days of clear skies less days of rain so overall what this is telling us is as global warming continues and as the Headlee cells are getting stronger we can expect more clear skies and less precipitation in the future so another way that we can look at evidence for climate change is to look at something that we call a time

[19:42] series of temperature in the very first graph we started off with in this lecture was a time series of temperature for the whole planet but you have a project this week and it's involves making a time series of temperature for a particular location and so I'm going to kind of show you how that's done and show you the type of graphs that you're going to be making so we can divide up the country into these areas called climate

[20:12] divisions and it kinda looks like counties but they're bigger than counties and all the areas within a climate division are supposed to have similar climates there's something similar about them they have similar topography or elevation or something and so we kind of group them all together so within each climate division you might have say several hundred operating weather stations and usually these weather stations are recording data at least once an hour sometimes once every

[20:43] 15 minutes or even more often than that and so what we're going to do is we're going to pull records from a climate division and we're going to look at we can look in what's how the temperatures have changed in the past so here's an example of a record that I pulled from a climate division called the northern mountains division so if I go back here this blob right here that's the northern mountains division and so what I've

[21:13] asked this to do and this is what you'll be doing on your project is I've generated a series of these each one of these as red dots represents a month of data from hundreds of weather stations across this whole region of the northern mountains division okay so this dot right here means that the computer went to the database and it looked at all the records for this month and so this is December of 2014

[21:43] ok and it looked at all the records kept by all the weather stations in this area day night the whole thing averaged the entire thing together and come up with one number for that entire month and that's what's plotted here okay so every one of these dots is one number for the entire month of that particular year averaged over this broad area with all those weather stations which are recording these are usually day/night at least once an hour

[22:13] okay so this is what this record looks like and I went back a few years and you can see there's this up down up down and that's just the seasons right so summer winter summer etc right and so from this record if I asked you do you see any evidence of climate change it'd be pretty tough to see anything because it's just what you're seeing is the seasonal swing right okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back

[22:43] more years so now I'm going to go back 20 years and look at how the temperatures have been changing so now again you can see summer winter summer winter and again if I asked you do you seen the evidence for changes it's probably kind of hard to see a lot here there's a lot of crazy up and down what if I go back even further so now I'm going back to 1940 so at first it just

[23:14] looks like a crazy bunch of up and down lines but you can start to use this graph like this to notice a few changes with time so let's look at the winners okay so there's these horizontal lines like here's a line this is 24 degrees notice how many winners in the past got colder than this 24 degree line right and then notice what happens after 1990 you see no more winners get colder than

[23:45] that 24 degree line now let me add what remember what this means that 24 that dot right there doesn't mean the winner got down the 24 degrees once that's average day and night over a whole month right the entire month averaged below 24 degrees that's what that's what we're talking about here but notice you can see that how often that winners got down to that 24 degree line and how often they went below that in the past and then starting about 1990 yeah there's a

[24:18] few that reached that line but nobody gets any colder below that or you could look at the summers and say ok notice that you know here's a 69 degree line for reference and you can see how often the summers reach that 69 degree line and either met it or maybe one a little bit past it and if he again you just kind of or just eyeballing this notice how much white space there is between say the sixty-four degree line and the 69 degree line and then notice how much closer

[24:51] these recent summers are to that 69 degree line there's a lot less of that white space in here and you can kind of see really the the number of summers that that surpassed that 69 degree line maybe isn't that that different but you can see that overall they're getting closer and closer to 69 degree line and again 69 degrees doesn't sound that warm but this is averaged over days and nights and we're in the northern mountains so the lot of these high elevation data or you can even go

[25:27] further back so now what I've done is I've gone all the way back to 1908 right so I've got a hundred years of data here and I'm gonna use the same tricks notice how often that winters got colder than 24 degrees in the past and then notice that that stops over here and then notice how often we get close to that 69 degree summer and then notice how often we do it in modern times so you can just kind of eyeball these and notice if

[25:58] there's any changes in the long-term trend there's obviously a lot of noise what we call noise in this where we had warm years and cool years and warm years and cool years but what's the overall trend that's what we're interested in we're talking about climate change so here's another one for example coming from now we're in the Cascade Mountains in Washington State and we're looking at a hundred years of data and I'm the same tricks notice how often the winners got

[26:29] below this 22 degree mark right you see these cold winters and they notice starting in the 80s you no longer see that right and in fact it's starting in the 90s they don't even hardly get below this 27 degree line on the other hand we can look at the summers how often did the summer has breached the 62 degree mark notice how much white space there is between the 57 and the 62 and then see what happens here that we start to get summers that are warmer than the 62 degree mark and

[27:01] that white space between those two lines disappears and so we're seeing a shift towards warmer and warmer summers and warmer and warmer winters and in fact when we do the math with global warming the biggest changes that we're seeing in terms of temperatures as we're seeing warmer nights and we're seeing warmer winters yeah we're seeing some warmer summers too but the biggest change like mathematically that's happening is the winners are getting warmer and the

[27:32] nights are getting warmer and that's due to the extra greenhouse gases okay so besides just eyeballing some data that's going up and down then trying to figure out whether it's increasing or decreasing scientists have more quantitative ways of dealing with this and I'm going to teach you one method that we use it's called a running mean or a running average so here's an example here we've got temperatures from days azar going by so let's just say

[28:03] that each one of these dots represents the average temperature for that 24 hour period so we get a temperature on the y axis we've got days on the on the x axis and when I look at this data I can see there's a lot of up and down right so so temperatures are going up and down and what I like to know is is there a overall increasing trend or decreasing trend or no trend in this okay that's what we're trying to figure out so what I'm going to do is apply something

[28:34] called in this case I'm gonna call this a five-day running average okay all right so here's how this works first I'm going to take the first five days one two three four five and I'm going to make like a window of this first five days of data and I'm gonna calculate what the average is of that five I'm gonna plot it in the middle of the window okay so my first

[29:06] five points are 34 40 137 no five six seven 38 sorry 38 42 and 45 so I just add those all up I divide by 5 and I get an answer of 40 okay so the average of all these is 40 so I'm gonna plot it

[29:38] right in the center of my window so there is my first point all right so I just took the average of five plot it in the middle okay so now I'm gonna take this this window and here's the key I'm gonna move it over one day okay so I'm gonna draw another one right here here's my new window okay so I just shifted it over one day and I'm gonna calculate the whole thing all right so I

[30:10] got 41 and 38 and 42 and 45 and 34 divided by 540 again okay so my new my new window my new calculation come is exactly same answer as it was before

[30:41] so I plot that in the middle so then I'm gonna shift it over one more so over one more and again I'm gonna calculate this new batch so 3847 45:34 and now a new point is 40 3/5 41.4 so

[31:14] now the center of this window 41.4 something like this so I'm starting to build this new graph of red dots that is the long-term trend and so what I see is it at first there's basically no change in the long-term trend now starting to move up and I can keep doing this by moving this window over and over and doing this calculations over and over and over and I'll get another

[31:44] line that tells me what the long-term trend is it's called a running average or a running mean very tedious to do this by hand but easy for a computer to do so part of what you're going to do in your project is when when you get some of these temperature records you're gonna tell it to calculate the running mean and it will just put it on your graph so I'll show you some examples here so here's an example of one of these graphs where I have used a running

[32:15] mean and I just asked the computer to do it I didn't do any math myself and this is a 12 month running mean and it produces this blue line so it takes every red point and takes six months ahead and six months behind and calculates what that running mean is and plus it is blue okay so now what you can see is the running mean and we're back in northern mountains division the running mean is bumping up and down between this 44 degree mark and the 49

[32:47] degree mark right it's kind of down here and then you see when you get to the 90s it stays closer to this 49 degree mark and doesn't ever go back down to this 44 degree mark so the long-term average has increased its average from somewhere kind of down in here to somewhere up in here okay or another example here's one from Arizona and so here the again 12-month running mean you can see that

[33:18] it's we're here in the you know it's bouncing back and forth between 61 and 63 degrees back in the early part of the 20th century and then when we get to the last 20 years it's now jumped up between the 61 and 63 did or sorry the 63 and a 65 degree mark up in here okay so we've seen a shift in the overall long term trend so this is how you're gonna use the running mean you can you can have

[33:48] the computer calculate it and look at it and see if there's any trend now what if there was no trend if there was no trend then what we would see is we might see some up and down the beginning of the century and it just kind of remained that same pattern all the way across until today and that's how you would know if there's any long-term trends in the data so when climate scientists are talking about global warming what we're looking at is we're looking at actual temperature measurements for the most part and so in modern times say the last

[34:18] 30 years that comes from mostly satellite data we've got satellites that can measure the entire temperature of the earth every day you go before satellites then you're looking at weather station data and before that just thermometers and the farther back you go the more difficult it is to really get some good data now as scientists that's what we look at when we're trying to figure out whether the earth is actually warming or not and there are some in in popular media a lot

[34:52] of times you'll hear that the reason that scientists know that the earth is warming is because of glaciers are doing this or the polar bears are doing that and those are effects of global warming but that's not really the evidence the evidence really comes from the temperature data but I want to talk about some of this other evidence because you'll hear about that and one of the things that we can look at that lets us know that the earth is warming is the decrease of ice on earth okay so

[35:23] one example is we can look at how much snow is on the ground in the northern hemisphere during the spring and one of the themes of this whole lecture is that when we're talking about climate change we're not looking at what's happening from one year to the next but it's the long-term right and so you can see from this that from year to year we have years where there is relatively high amount of snow and then we have relatively low amount and it bounces back and forth but the overall

[35:54] trend is kind of this downhill slope here and if we go to something like the Arctic sea ice which is the sea ice up around the North Pole you know here's a graph looking at the Arctic summer sea ice extent and again we see ups and downs but there's this overall trend headed downhill so that's kind of what we're seeing for climate change and again just to reiterate we're not looking at this and concluding that the earth is getting warmer we're looking at the temperature data and concluding the

[36:24] earth is getting warmer but this is another thing that we can see as evidence so here is a animation showing the extent of the Arctic sea ice from year to year and I'm gonna I've got it paused right now but just orient yourself so here's Canada there's Alaska right there and then here's Siberia and notice how close the ice is to the margins of these continents okay and this is these images you're going to see

[36:55] is during is is the extent of the ice in the summer okay so in the winter it pretty much always reaches out to the extent of the of the boundaries here okay so let me let me play this so year two here notice how the margins of the ice change and some years are colder and there's more ice some years are warmer there's less ice but we're looking for the overall trend and notice that in

[37:26] some summers the ice actually doesn't even reach the land masses in some instances which meaning which means it opens up the Seaway dad didn't used to be there okay now this is a little obsolete ends in 2011 since this was made the sea ice is actually decreased even more now we're going to look at the same data except we're also superimposing a time series graph and this is again to

[37:56] illustrate the point that I keep trying to make which is that climate change is not something we observe year-to-year it's a long term trend and so even though we can see that you know some years there is more ice in some years there's less the overall trend is one of going downhill and that's what they're showing here on this plot that they superimposed on the same movie that we just saw okay so along with that is the fact that we're seeing a lot more melting of

[38:27] continental glaciers than we saw previously and so Greenland is one of the examples where you know Greenland is one of these places that we've been drilling ice cores because it has not melted for hundreds of thousands of years and yet now we're seeing sort of record amounts of Greenland starting to melt and it makes for some very spectacular photos like this waterfall here but that's not supposed to be happening and you know it's it's kind of

[38:57] a shocking amount of ice that's been melting so here's just a three-year study from 2004 to 2007 Greenland lost amount of ice equivalent to 14 States of course they picked little States but still each of these 3 feet thick you know that's a significant amount of ice that that it lost now there's still a lot there so it's not going to be disappearing you know even in a few years it's going to take a while but we're seeing record amount of ice melt coming off of Greenland in the springs

[39:30] and summers so here's a Renu's report from a couple years ago scientists incredulous at normally high numbers for April record melting across 12% of the ice sheet so that's more than they'd ever seen before this time of year also we can look at glaciers and we can we can look at where the glaciers were about a hundred years ago so I've got some before-and-after images and again if you if you watch media popular

[40:02] media programs on climate change they'll kind of frame this as scientists look at this and we can tell that global warming is happening because of this I want to emphasize that this is one of the effects of global warming but but this is not great data for scientists this is one of the effects so here we are a glacier so before and after picture 100 years apart you can see the glacier in the foreground and nothing left but a little patch of snow in the background on on the modern picture here's another

[40:32] one from 1920 again you can see the glacier here and this little ice field about a hundred years later this glacier here it isn't in the background no sign of it anymore or this one which is now way back there and you can see these you know pictures from like this all over the place where there where there are glaciers that there's if you look a hundred years ago you see this big difference right so here's Olympic National Park that before I'm sorry the

[41:04] before and the after right or this one the before and there it is way in the background the after this is a little bit of a confined of a confusing image we're looking down from space this is the top that glacier flow downhill this way and this is it melting and chunks of ice are floating in the water here so these lines are what we call the old terminus this is where the glacier used to be so in the 1851 this is where the

[41:35] glacier ended this was the terminus and then as you you know 1902 this is the terminus headed uphill 2000s it's up here the last mark on there is actually over ten years old now it's 2006 and they need to update this image but the glacier is now somewhere back here so it's been retreating every year more or less as as a climate has gotten warmer other evidence that the for our warmer

[42:06] temperatures is that the sea level is rising okay now our records of sea level get more more sketchy the further back we go so you'll see there's several lines here so this is year 1900 this is millimeters above they picked a 30-year average again they didn't tell us where it was but there's a 30-year average that they're comparing this to and they're comparing how much global sea average has changed some particular thirty year period and there's different lines because they've been measuring

[42:36] different different ways if there's different techniques for trying to figure out the global sea level and then suddenly you see the lines get thinner and that's because we start measuring them from satellites and it becomes a lot more accurate now your book talked about this a little bit but just to make sure you didn't miss it there's two reasons why the oceans are rising number one is the one that everybody probably can guess if you melt ice that ice goes into the sea and the sea level rises right you melt glaciers sea level goes up but

[43:06] that's actually the smaller component the more significant reason is because when you warm up water it actually expands a little bit so as the oceans get warmer the entire oceans in all of it is starting to expand just from warmer temperatures so those two things together are why the oceans are rising now once we got satellites that could measure the ocean from basically it's like using radar where they beam down then they hit the ocean they bounce back and they can measure it pretty precisely

[43:37] we got satellites that can do that starting in the early 90s and what you can see the dark blue is kind of up and down changes year to year of the sea levels but if you the red line is sort of the trend line the overall trend and the overall trend is that the seas have been increasing it about three point four millimeters per year okay so that's not huge right three point four millimeters that's not a lot but it's starting to add up over the decades and

[44:08] especially is becoming noticeable if you live pretty close to sea level so this is not a hurricane or anything weird this is just a high tide the town in Florida that's built pretty close to sea level and we can see that now the ocean is starting to come in where it didn't used to come before in fact there are these cities along Florida where places that didn't hardly ever used to flood except in rare events are starting to flood on a regular occurrence now then water's coming up in the storm drains

[44:38] and you know it's not coming from the ocean it's coming up the storm drains in flooding the streets now because those areas are now starting to become below sea level when they didn't used to be another way that you can see this is again just another example from from Virginia and Norfolk so this is along the coast and they this is kind of a weird graph it's our per year of flooding in this particular neighborhood so somehow or another I

[45:09] don't know who thought of this but they started recording how many hours per year this particular neighborhood was under flooding and so back in the 30s is when they started this and you can see that as time has gone on they see more and more hours of flooding in this neighborhood again this is not great data for scientists because there could be other things that contribute to flooding in the neighborhood how you you know how the streets are being maintained and how the storm sewers are being maintained and all that kind of

[45:39] stuff but it's just another illustration of how rising sea levels are affecting some neighborhoods so to conclude we've got evidence that the temperatures are increasing in the summers in the winters and the days and the nights especially during the nights especially during the winters we see it over the continents especially we see where the oceans some we see it up in the atmosphere we've talked about all those things also what we've seen in the previous lecture is

[46:10] that greenhouse gases are higher now than they've been in the past million years or so probably more but we can say for sure in the past million so we know the temperatures are higher than they've been in a long time we know that greenhouse gases are higher than they've been in a long time we know how greenhouse gases work so the question is are can we say a hundred percent sure that the extra greenhouse gases are changing the climate or could there be some other factor at work so what is another way that Mother Nature

[46:42] could possibly change the climate how could we make the earth warmer it if it's not humans producing greenhouse gases what else could it possibly be well one thing it could possibly be are sunspots so the Sun turns out is not at a constant luminosity it goes through these 11-year cycles of sunspots and the Sun has these magnetic storms and they're not very well understood but what we do know is that the Sun has

[47:13] these cycles of eleven years where it goes through periods of or sunspots and then periods of less sunspots now here is what is counterintuitive when you have a sunspot the sunspot is dark because it's cooler than the surrounding area and you'd think okay if the Sun has more sunspots it should be cooler but it turns out that when there are sunspots the area surrounding the sunspot is actually extra hot and makes up for the

[47:44] sunspot and more than makes up for it so when you have a Sun with more sunspots the Sun is actually hotter by a few degrees and it's not huge but it's enough to make a difference of the climate on earth so more sunspots means a hotter Sun and again that's counterintuitive you'd probably think that more sunspots would be a cooler Sun so people have been noticing counting sunspots ever since the telescope was invented and so here's an example of a

[48:16] peak where there's a peak in the 11-year cycle and then a decrease in that 11-year cycle then the peak 11 years later and so forth so every 11 years we have a peak in the sunspot cycle and then ago they decrease again so here is a movie of sunspots and before I start it notice they've got yellow and they've got blue here and sunspots have a north and a south so they're magnetic and so that's what the two colors mean and

[48:46] we're going to look at a quick movie time-lapse of several years of sunspots so it's going to rotate at first to show you here's the an active Sun with a lot of sunspots and then it's going to kind of split it apart so you can see the whole Sun is a big map and then it's going to play ok Dec 3 2013 7 years

[49:17] later and then they disappear there's that here comes the next cycle so every 11 years we see this maximum and then back down to minimum again that's the sunspot cycle and each time it does that the Sun is a little bit warmer during the maximum a little bit cooler during the minimum so one of the things that Galileo did as soon as even into telescope is he started observing sunspots so we've got an actual record of sunspots all the way

[49:47] back to about 1610 is when he started doing this and one of the weird things that happened in the late 1600s is the sunspots went almost disappeared completely for several decades like half a century it's called the maunder minimum and for whatever reason the Sun went into kind of a relatively low activity state and we had very few sunspots decade after decade well that period of low sunspot activity

[50:17] corresponds to something that we call the Little Ice Age and it was a period where the earth was actually a little bit cooler than usual not full-on Ice Age with like glaciers coming down and all that but if you look at the historical records farmers had a hard time during the Little Ice Age a lot of crops failed because the earth was relatively cooler than it was supposed to be and then we also see there some other times say in the early 1800s where the sunspot number was a lot

[50:47] lower than it was supposed to be and and there was a measurable cooler earth just by maybe half a degree or something like that but it makes a difference well so some critics of modern day global warming science will say that Oh the reason the earth is getting warmer today is because of sunspots okay so let's look at that so we count sunspots today and this curve followed by this curve or the last two solar cycles so the so this

[51:21] is the last solar cycle and this is the one before that so the one before that peaked in about 2000 2001 and the black dots are how many solar how many sunspots are being counted and the blue is like a running mean so they're using the same math that we did earlier so you can see okay it looks like the the sunspot cycle back in 2000 2001 peak that you know whatever 125 whether whatever this level is here here's so then the sunspots decrease right so that's

[51:53] this part and then they ramp up again and it's supposed to peak 11 years after this but but instead of peaking up here like the previous one it's peaking down here and so we have actually had a relatively inactive sunspot cycle in the past you know this passing spots cycle it's supposed to be up here we had fewer sunspots and we're supposed to so the Sun is actually cooler than it's supposed to be so the argument that

[52:23] sunspots are somehow making the climate warmer are exactly backwards the amount of sunspots we have is lower than it should be so if the sunspots were back up where they ought to be we ought to see it climate it's even warmer than we have today so another thing you will hear from climate change deniers and these are the people who think that there either is no climate change or if it is it's naturally occurring they will say that volcanic eruptions are what's behind climate change and usually what

[52:54] they say is the amount of greenhouse gases coming out of the volcano is greater than that of produced by humans now one reason you already know why that's not true is because when we looked at the Keeling curve remember that that's the curve of co2 going up and up and up a little bit each year if the amount of greenhouse gases coming out of volcanoes was significant then you would see a big jump every time there was a volcanic eruption but you never see that and in fact all the co2 sensors around the world that monitor

[53:25] how much co2 is in the atmosphere they don't do anything when you have a big volcanic eruption it's just not enough co2 so that's not the reason but there is a reason that volcanoes can change the climate if you have a big volcanic eruption and this is the last really big one sort of in our lifetime was Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 this big cloud you see is something called volcanic ash and it's a little tiny microscopic pieces of rock and it's mostly glass and if it's a really big

[53:57] eruption material will get ejected up into the stratosphere and when it gets up into the stratosphere as we learn in the way early lecture there is no whether to remove ash from the stratosphere or anything from there's no weather up there there's no causes no precipitation and so it goes up and it spreads out and one of the things that it does is it blocks sunlight and it cools the planet so for example here's a little time-lapse movie of a poignant style

[54:31] eruption and so this is the ash coming up and you might see some lightning in there too this looks like the anvil from a cumulonimbus and this marks the top of the stratosphere or the I'm sorry the top of the tropopause in the beginning of the stratosphere and you can see once of all you'll see some some ash punching through and going up into the stratosphere and so that Ash once it goes up into the stratosphere will stay up usually like a couple of years before it finally gets removed see right there

[55:01] you can see it going up into the stratosphere so this will have a change in the climate but it has a cooling effect not a warming effect so we have instruments that actually measure how much dust is in the stratosphere and this is the readout from one of these and let's see if we can make sense of this so what we're looking at is a graph let's ignore the color one for now and we're looking at this black and white graph this is how much dust is in the

[55:32] stratosphere as the years go by so this is 1985 moving forward and we see there's a big spike right here in the amount of dust in stratosphere that's Mount Pinatubo and then it decreases and takes several years for it to come back to normal well during this time in here after Pinatubo erupted we saw that the world global temperature decreased about at one degree or one and a half degrees centigrade so it actually changed the climate and you can see these little

[56:02] bumps here these are smaller volcanic eruptions that also had put ash into the stratosphere but at a lesser amount if you go back in time you can see that we've actually had some volcanoes much larger than Pinatubo every one of these little spikes here has been a big eruption kind of like the one we just saw in that movie except bigger and there has you know for you know this goes way back hundreds of years but for the periods of time that we actually have written records what we see is that every time there was a really big eruption like Krakatoa there

[56:34] was actually a recorded cooing event afterwards a lot a crop failure you know in modern times where we actually had temperature measurements we can measure that we had a cooler summer that followed so everyone in these big ones probably resulted in a in a dip in the Earth's temperatures for a year or two following that eruption so if we take all the sunspot records into account and we take all the volcanic eruption records into account we can reconstruct

[57:05] the climate of the earth in the past several hundred years and what we see is that we can explain pretty much all of the changes in Earth's climate over the past several hundred years except for what's happened in the past hundred the warming that we're seeing in the past hundred years cannot be explained with volcanoes or sunspots and we're left with really the only thing remaining which is human greenhouse gases
