hey this is Mel and in this lecture we're gonna be talking about how we generate electricity with fossil fuels so in the previous unit we've been talking about greenhouse gases and one of the things that we said is it we actually burn more fossil fuels to generate electricity than we do for anything else even transportation so the number one source of co2 emissions in the world is for generating electricity we're going to explore how that's done okay so to start with we're going to talk about how electricity is generated and in general you need three things to generate electricity you need a conductor which is usually a metal you need a magnetic field and you need motion so let's talk about these what is a conductor a conductor is usually copper but it doesn't have to be but it's a metal so imagine a wire right so I've got this copper wire here and when we when we talk about electricity what we really mean is we've got the flow of electrons going down a wire okay so to get that to happen if I take a magnet so remember a magnet has a north cell north side in the south side and let's say I move this magnet back and forth what I would if I move this magnet back and forth what I would notice is that the little electrons would start moving down the wire okay and if I move this back and forth the electrons will change direction back and forth as well so the conductor is a metal that allows the electrons to flow and the motion of the magnet is what forces the electrons to move both those things together will generate electricity so if I say wanted to power let's say a light bulb then I would hook this say to the light bulb okay and as I move this back and forth the electrons would actually move down the wire through the light and they would continue going on a loop and the light would light up right so that's electricity so a simple demonstration is so you may have seen something like this that this is a hand-crank generator and inside there there's a little you see that little metal cylinder that's got magnet in there and when I spin the handle okay the light lights up okay okay so you need three things to generate electricity magnetic field the conductor and in motion so the wires or the conductor a physical magnet or maybe a coil wire is the magnetic field but you need something to move it and the thing that moves it is usually something called a steam turbine so a steam turbine looks like a giant fan and these the steam turbines sit inside this housing and steam comes in these holes and pushes against the the blades of this turbine and this whole thing spins around and around and around and on the other end it's gonna connect to something that's producing a magnetic field that will then spin in the same way that I just spun that little one so steam turbines can be gigantic and the reason they have multiple blades as so as the steam goes through them it it's the max it's the most efficient way of trying to capture all the energy from the steam is they have multiple fan blades so on in short what happens to steam comes in and turns the the blades of the turbine which then turn a giant version of the thing I was just holding and that is what generates electricity so this is what one looks like in an actual power plant everything's covered so you don't there's not much to see but the steam comes in here there's the the fan blades would be in here the turbine and it's spinning this thing which has the magnetic field and it's generating the electricity that's the generator here's another one steam comes in there here's the generator and in a big big power plant they'll have several of these so here they've got several steam turbines and then turning generators here okay so there everything's covered there's not a whole lot to see if you're actually to go inside a power plant but in order to do this you got to make steam in order to make steam you got to boil water in order to boil water you need a source of heat okay so what are some of the things that we could actually burn well purpose of this lecture is to talk about fossil fuels so that's probably where we're in the start this this is a graph that's talking about co2 emissions from different sectors and I just want to focus on this one right here it says electricity generation so by burning fossil fuels we can boil water and this breaks it down into which fossil fuel we burn the most and this color right here is coal so that's number one number two is natural gas that's thread and then just a little bit of petroleum so we in general in this country do not burn oil to make electricity we typically burn coal number one and number two we burn natural gas now in New Mexico what's kind of a crappy graphic but it's only one I got about three-quarters of all the electricity in New Mexico is from burning coal and almost all the rest is from natural gas and we're starting to see a little bit of renewables since this slide was made in 2009 since then renewables has gone up a little bit but it's still pretty low so let's talk about coal so what is coal well coal figure to look at kind of as a black shiny looking Rock and it starts with womp so in a swamp you if you kind of think back to our lecture on dams and how we said the bottom of a reservoir gamma reverie and you make a artificial lake at the bottom you have very little oxygen right well this is happening naturally in a swamp so this water down here is very stagnant and and near the bottom there's very little oxygen so as material plant leaves whatever they fall down they land in the water they sink to the bottom they actually get preserved because there's no oxygen down there to promote decay and so the organic material builds up and builds up as long as these swamps stay in existence eventually the swamp the material from the swamps is buried and we would call that peat so you can go to say nursery or Home Depot wherever you can buy bags of peat and it looks like kind of old crappy looking leaves and you put in your garden as fertilizer but eventually if over geologic time those that peat will become buried as weak as it becomes buried it's good it gets subjected to pressure and heat and there's this metamorphism that happens where that what looks like old dead leaves turns into this black shiny rock and then we call it coal and high-quality coal has been has been buried you know maybe miles below the surface and subjected to really high temperatures for maybe over millions of years so it's it's seen a lot of heat and pressure by the time we pull it back out of the ground but it used to be for the most part dead plant matter so this is what a coal seam looks like so you can imagine this all used to be the bottom of a swamp long buried subjected to heat and pressure transformed into this coal and in order to get to the coal if I just go back you know you've got to dig this rock away to get to the coal down here and sometimes it's that's really easy like these guys there's just right below the surface but often it's not very close to the surface and you gotta go way down to get it there's a couple ways we do that one is called mountaintop removal and everything you see in this in this picture is coal you can see all the black out here and this used to be a mountain and they started at the top and they started to remove all the stuff that was not coal to get down to the coal and that's what they're doing here so it's a big operation requires big equipment big trucks big shovels and they have to remove a lot of material for this to be profitable so here's a mountaintop removal the pictures I'm showing you here are mostly from the east east half of the country so Appalachian region a lot of this so this was a mountain with trees on it and they have started at the top and worked their way down well if you if you do this you there's a lot of environmental destruction that's going on as a result of mountaintop removal a lot of the material ends up in the rivers you're wiping out all of the vegetation that was on top and just from a human perspective I mean it's a pretty ugly thing to look at but you can see in this picture the black is the coal and the the beige is not coal but they got to take it all down anyway whether it's coal or not because they got to remove the stuff that don't want to get down to this stuff that they do want so again all these pictures mountaintop removal okay so it's a pretty a pretty environmentally destructive way to remove coal now the other way of doing it is underground mines so an underground mine is you did coals underground so you drill a hole down get a tunnel going and this is really difficult dangerous work you follow that coal seam and so environmentally it's actually better for the environment because you're not taking down a whole mountain to get to it you're just making a hole going down there from a workman's perspective it is a very dangerous job there's coal dust dangerous equipment gases coming out and by the way everything you're mining is flammable so the accidents happen and coal fires happen and occasionally we get some disaster so here's one from 2010 where 25 people in West revenge vert West Virginia died when there is an explosion so there's a methane gas buildup and they ignited and we don't have this so we have decent amount of safety rules in this country but if you look at some other countries like China and they was you know usually a couple hundred people a year mining coal it's a bit underground it's a very dangerous job and like I said everything you're mining is flammable so why are we burning coal in the first place well we just have a lot of it and as an accident a geologic history that the United States has a lot of coal the reason is is for millions of years we were actually situated in a place where swamps were very common widespread over most of the country so if you ever seen pictures of the Everglades today you can imagine that type of environment all across the United States and so all these places that are blue are places where we see a lot of coal deposits because in geologic time there was just extensive swamps for they they existed for millions of years you'll notice that one of those places happens to be in Northwest New Mexico ok so we have a pretty good coal deposit up in here and consequently we have coal mines in that area and coal-fired power plants so one of the biggest ones we have is called the San Juan generating station there's actually several near the Four Corners area you can see here pile of coal here we've got a conveyor belt system that takes the coal up into the power plant so a power plant like this you see there's four chimneys right that means there's four furnaces that feed four turbines okay so here we can see three of them this white that's coming out is water vapor and a long time ago we talked about how when you burn hydrocarbons water vapor as a byproduct so then back then we were talking about it in terms of what makes a cloud so I actually used a coal-fired power plant as an example back then so what's coming out here is water vapor that's condensing making a cloud from burning of the coal now remember the whole reason we're talking about this is because of greenhouse gases and as we're burning coal or producing a lot of carbon dioxide and a little bit of meal a few other things as well but you can't see that right you cannot see the mercury that if there is any that's coming out you can't see the NOx all you can really see is the water vapor but near the Four Corners area we've got several large generating stations cold fire power plants because coal is so plentiful there so here's a coal mine near Farmington for example here's another one their Page Arizona you can see it's got three chimneys therefore it has three furnaces with three steam turbines there's the coal piled up right here ready to go another picture of it here's what a here's a pile of coal that's getting ready to load it up into a coal-fired power plant so that in this case the barges are bringing it down they dump in this pile and they comes up the conveyor belt and the amount of coal that is burned and each coal-fired power plant is kind of staggering so this is a coal train and it's just a train full of coal and generally they can be about a mile long or so and a really big coal-fired power plant like the one we have in the four corners can burn through three to five trains of coal per day so that gives you some kind of amount you know it's a staggering amount of coal that we're bringing through every single day just to keep generating electricity so we're gonna watch a little video here that was put together by a coal-fired power plant company that explains very well how it works and they're going to go through the steps from the coal going into the into the power plant until electricity is generated and it's it's very well done it's animated one of the things I want you to pay attention to is they're going to talk about several technology geez that they use to clean the exhaust so in other words as they burn the coal and exhaust goes up the chimney they have to clean that before it goes into the air and they'll talk about several things that happen to clean that and I just want to point out that the culpa the coal-fired power plants in this country are required to do those things from our Clean Air Act so so in the past we talked about air pollution we talked about we have these regulations for for air air pollution and other countries don't necessarily have those right so the technologies are talking about in this video are not the same technologies that you may find say in a in a power plant in China okay because they don't have the same stringent air laws that we do so keep that in mind let's watch the video [Music] our process uses Powder River Basin coal from Wyoming the sub-bituminous type coal as a fuel source when the coal arrives that our plant by train we use a trencher and a series of long conveyors to stack coal in our yard move it to storage silos or send it directly to the plant we try to keep a thirty seven day supply of coal about 1.4 million tons on the pile in our coal yard and up to forty thousand tons in silos since we burn as much as thirty eight thousand tons of coal in a 24 hour period we need to ensure we have a substantial amount on hand cold moves into the plant on a conveyor and is stored in a series of silos each one leading to a feeder pulverizer and ultimately to the boiler at plant miller we have four generating units and each unit has seven silos feeding into one single boiler the coal within each silo falls into a feeder which measures and controls the flow of coal into a polarizer inside the pulverizer coal falls onto a large rotating bowl where it is continuously crushed by three large grinding wheels until it becomes the consistency of baby powder once the coal is a fine powder it falls off the grinding Bowl and is carried by warm primary air maintained at 140 degrees Fahrenheit inside the pulverizer to the boiler through 8 burner lines when the particles have cold reached the burners they are mixed with secondary air that has been preheated to over 500 degrees to support complete combustion inside the boiler the combustion of the coal converts its chemical energy into thermal energy creating a temperature inside the boiler of over 2200 degrees that's enough to heat the water in the series of boiler tubes to create steam which moves onto the turbine to power the next step in our process superheated steam from the boiler which is approximately 2400 psi and 1,000 degrees travels to the high-pressure section of the turbine where it creates the force that turns the turbine shaft this process causes the steam to lose temperature and pressure so it must be sent back to the boiler to be reheated to 1,000 degrees after reheating the steam returns to the intermediate turbine and continues through the crossover into the low pressure turbines the force of the steam turns the turbine shaft which turns the generator rotor at 3,600 revolutions per minute this rotation along with the induced current on the rotor inside the generator produces voltage completing the process of generating electricity the generator output is 24,000 volts which is stepped up to as much as 500,000 volts for transmission plant Miller uses a closed-loop circulating water system that allows water to be reused over and over one way we use water is in the condenser where steam enters from the turbine and condenses back into water as it passes over tubes filled with cool circulating water which is chlorinated river water from nearby mulberry Fork of the Warrior River the condensed water moves into the hot well where it reads the system to be reheated turned back into steam and continue its use throughout the plant let's take a closer look at the circulating water the plant uses starting at the cooling tower cool water is pumped from the cooling tower basin through large pipes to the condenser to absorb most of the heat from the turbine exhaust steam leaving us with warmer water that must be cooled so the warmer water is circulated back to the cooling tower where it enters through riser lines to the top of the cooling tower fill as the water cascades down the cooling tower fill material it's air cooled allowing the heat to escape up through the natural draft cooling tower the cooled water is collected in the cooling tower basin to be recirculated back to the plant to condense more turbine steam exhaust once combustion is complete the heavier particles of ash called bottom ash fall into the bottom of the boiler there the bottom ash is crushed using clinker grinders mixed with water and sluice to the hydro bins where the water is decanted and ash collected in dump trucks and either sold or moved to on-site storage while the heavier particles of ash fall to the bottom of the Pointer the hot flue gas containing finer particles of fly ash naturally flows up to the top of the boiler and around down and out through the back pass section the last section of the boiler is the economizer because of the shape and the flue gas flow path some of the fly ash falls out here into hoppers this economizer ash is pulled by vacuum mixed and sluiced with water to the ash booster station where it is moved to on-site storage flue gas a byproduct of combustion exits the boiler and enters the selective catalytic reduction oxide compounds the flue gas then passes across the air heater where over 400 degrees of temperature are transferred from the exiting flue gas to preheat the primary and secondary air entering the plant next the flue gas passes through the precipitators where a negative charge is induced onto the fine particles of ash contained in the flue gas that ash is then collected with an opposing charged collecting plate these plates are then shaken by vibrating wrappers causing the ash to fall off into hoppers at the bottom of the precipitator the ash is then pulled with a vacuum to a collection facility for Seiler storage the flue gas then passes through the induced draught fans and to the scrubber where booster fans pull the flue gas from the plant and push it through the scrubber absorber in the absorber flue gas mixes with water and limestone the limestone reacts with and removes about 98% of sulfur dioxide creating the byproduct of gypsum the wet flue gas exits out the top of the absorber through to the wet stack and a gypsum slurry stream is pulled from the bottom of the absorber and sent through a dewatering facility inside the dewatering facility most of the moisture is removed from the gypsum so it can be sold for use in wallboard when the power leaves the plant we increase or step up the voltage for transmission purposes to as much as five hundred thousand volts to help minimize losses from the transmission of power our transmission group is responsible for the large transmission lines towers and substations that handle the large voltage transfer of power over long distances our distribution group interacts with our customers more directly and handles delivery of the power in lower voltages stepped down in substations and delivered to industrial commercial and residential customers in various voltages to suit their needs it is our responsibility to provide our customers with reliable affordable and clean energy for their needs and we take that very seriously we hope you enjoyed this virtual tour of plant Miller so one problem that coal-fired power plants still have is they don't know what to do with all of the ash that's left over when they're done burning the coal so in that video they talked about fly ash so ash is just you know if you had a fireplace and you burn some wood you got leftover ash in the bottom when you're done right and so there's technology in that coal-fired power plant to keep the ash from flying out the chimney that's what they call fly ash and flies out right but there's ash left in the bottom and they have to do something with it and if they're burning you know multiple trains full of coal a day they're generating a lot of ash so in this picture here you can see it looks like this muddy area this is coal ash and they have to keep it wet so it doesn't blow away and they actually don't really know what to do with it so this big area right out in here is a pond and so they you know they take a shot of the furnace they dump it into this big pond where it stays wet eventually settles down and here's an here's an example of one of these ash reservoirs so they're dumping ash into this water you can kind of see there's an outlet here so some of its going out into the river there's regulations in this country as to how much ash can get into the river system and our current administration has been trying to weaken those regulations so that coal power plants can can add more to the rivers than they have in the past I don't know where that'll go and people were trying to figure out what to do with all this ash can we like mix it in concrete to get rid of it we make something out of it usually it's just buried so this whole field here is all coal ash and there are some event where there's a big erosion here but all this dark stuff you see is coal ash right they just kept dumping and dumping in this field and they had kept it wet and kept it wet and they finally got something to grow on it and really they just thought of a solution they don't know what to do with all of it there's been a couple of disasters where coal ash has leaked out from reservoir and there's a big disaster about 10 years ago in Tennessee where one of these coal ash reservoirs broke about 1:00 in the morning all of this wet gooey coal ash comes out and goes through town there's chunks of roads in the hair it's kind of hard to see but this is all muddy coal ash that went through a town wiped out some houses comes down gets in the river gets carried downstream so there's a lot of places in the United States where coal ash is becoming a problem this is a few years old now but this is a map showing the yellow dots are places where there are these waste ponds these reservoirs that have coal ash sitting in them staying wet places that are orange are recognized as having a high hazard potential of having a leak or a failure and then the red ones or places where there was some sort of failure or gotten to the groundwater or something like that happen so what you see here is there's a lot of red dots out here but of course there's just a lot more coal fire power plants out here because there's a lot more coal out here the eastern part of the country has the majority of the cold fire power plants so they have the most coal ash and therefore they have the most coal ash related problems now we could burn natural gas instead of coal and one advantage of doing that is natural gas has a much cleaner fuel to burn it's cleaner in that it produces less greenhouse gases than coal does now coal produces all kinds of stuff produces co2 ash etc if I burn natural gas I still get co2 but I get less of it and there's no leftover ash product and we don't have piles of coal everywhere so all you have to do is you have to have a pipe that takes the the the natural gas from wherever came from so if you live in Albuquerque the natural gas probably came from somewhere around Carlsbad and down the pipe that we talked about in the past and it comes to a power plant and here's for example you can see there's four chimneys here there's four turbines and so they burn they burn it spins a turbine just just like the coal does and generates electricity that way here's another one but what you don't see here is you don't see the piles of coal and all the apparatus for that so when we talk about electricity there's some vocabulary and some math that we gotta get into and ultimately what we're trying to do is calculate what we call carbon footprint so where we're headed in this class is if I do something like I turn on an appliance for a certain amount of time how much co2 did I produce that's where we're headed with all this okay so to get there there's a couple things that we've got to know one is energy and one is power and they're related to each other and that power is how much energy you use over the time that you use it and you can think of this as a rate of energy consumption now a physicist does not like to use the term consuming energy or using energy we don't really talk about that way we convert energy from one form to another but in everyday language we talk about things like I'm going to use energy or waste energy right but just to be clear we're just converting it from one form to another but verbally we say things that are different than that and I will too because that's how we talk so rate of energy consumption is power it's how fast are using the energy and the unit that we use for this is called the Wat Hey so James Watt he's a guy that helped develop the steam engine back in the 1700s and so his last name is used today as a unit of power and one watt means you're using one Joule of energy per second now that probably has no meaning to you either because what's a jewel and that's a unit that if you're a physicist that would make sense to you what a jewel is but it's not something we have in everyday use but if you think about taking an apple and lifting it one meter off the ground right so you pick it up off the ground one meter that's about a Joule of energy it took you a Joule of energy to do that so one watt would mean do you use it one Joule of energy for every second right okay so this is power and you've heard of this because for one thing you may have heard in terms of lightbulbs right so you might hear something like a hundred watt light bulb right you may have heard of it that way or some guys can tell you that they have a you know thousand watt stereo right so that is it you know another place you may have heard about it if you have a hairdryer on the side and I have a number like 1300 or 1350 those are that's its rating and Watts so watts is something you probably have heard of before and this is all power it's how you a 100 watt light bulb means it uses a hundred joules of energy of electricity every second that's what it means a thousand watt stereo is capable of using a thousand joules a second all right so energy is the converse of this power times time so I'm just taking this formula and rewriting it solving it it's the same exact formula but here's how we we would do this let's imagine that I've got a 60 watt light bulb and I have it on for let's say four hours how much energy did I use again we're using the word use energy consumed energy whatever we're converting it from one form to the other but blah blah blah we know that okay so what do we do math is easy 60 watts times four hours and 60 times four is 240 now I've got the unit of watts I got a unit of hours and when they multiply these two together we write it as what time's our so this what our is by itself the unit of energy okay so in physics there's a bunch of different units of energy the one we're going to use in this class and the only one we're gonna use in this class is something called the watt hour how many watts times how many hours you take that watt times that our it becomes watt hour that's it's like its own thing the watt hour it's not watts per hour that would be divided by its Watts times hour okay so verbal you'd say this 240 watt hours that's how you would say it okay so that's what that means now let's do another example and let's say I now have I've got a hundred watt light bulb and let's say it's a porch light and I turn it on and I just leave it on okay so it's on for 24 hours a day and I'd like to know how much energy I'm using in a week energy used in one week okay so energy the formula that we just had less power times time okay so power is always in watts time is always in hours and sometimes you've got to do a little math to figure out what your total hours are so in this case my energy is somewhat so Energy's power to assign power is 100 watts okay so what's my time gonna be well it's on 24 hours a day but it's on for a week right so there's seven days in a week so I multiply that by seven okay so I've got a hundred watts times 24 times seven so let me do that real quick 100 times 24 times seven equals sixteen thousand eight hundred now my units are watt hours okay 16 thousand eight hundred watt hours now if you have over a thousand watt hours we're going to we're going to alter that unit a little bit okay if I have over a thousand the convention that we do is we divide by a thousand and add a K in front of it so if I have over a thousand watt hours I'm going to divide the answer by a thousand and then add a little K to the unit all right it's like this so sixteen thousand eight hundred watt hours it's over a thousand so I'm then divided by a thousand and I get sixteen point eight and I know that add k2 watt hours all right so the way that verbally reads is 16.8 kilowatt hours but people got tired of writing all that out so there's an abbreviation for the kilowatt hours it's called K WH and this is called when we talk about a kWh we say verbally you is a kilowatt-hour that's how we say it a kilowatt hour and the kilowatt hour is the worldwide standard for measuring electrical energy okay so outside your house you have a kilowatt hour meter because this is how the power company charges you for the electricity that you use so here's an old-school one that's got the dials on it right and the guys come over and there's this you know this disc spins right here and the more electricity you use the faster it spins and these dials tell somebody how many kilowatt hours yeah you have used since the last time the meter reader person came out and took a reading and then you're charged by your kilowatt hours so notice that this meter actually spells out kilowatt hours and this one just says kWh right so when you're charged by the electric company so for example around here it's usually PNM is our electric company you will get charged per kilowatt hour right so a rate depends on kind of where you live but maybe somewhere between on the low end maybe eight cents - depending on where you live may be as high as 30 cents per kilowatt hour so we're going to learn how to calculate a carbon footprint which just means how much carbon are we putting into the atmosphere when we do different things and we're focusing in this class on electricity cuz it's kind of the easiest one to deal with so let's imagine that all of my electricity is being generated by coal and so if I do an activity let's say I leave a light on for a certain number of hours or TV on for a certain number of hours I want to know how much coal had to be burned to do that and as a result how much carbon got into the atmosphere because of that okay so there are modern coal-fired power plants there are older Coldfire power plants they're not all the same efficiency but when you look at all of them roughly it comes out that to generate one kilowatt hour to generate one kilowatt hour of electricity with coal you need to burn one kilogram or about 2.2 pounds of coal and that's about the size of a big shoebox right so imagine kind of extra-large shoebox full of coal that's about how much you need okay so the problems that we're gonna have are all kind of the same format which is that we'll have a scenario we want to know how much coal is going to be burned and then we're going to figure out from that how much co2 is produced so it turns out that when you burn one kilogram of coal that you will produce two kilograms of co2 gas or if I burn 2.2 pounds to put it in our unit system we get 4.4 pounds of co2 so in other words I get more co2 out of the chimney then the amount of coal that I put in why would that be because the call reacts when you burn the coal it reacts with oxygen in the air to produce more co2 so so one kilogram of coal to kilograms of co2 all right that's we're talking about mass of a gas which is abstract cuz we don't think about gases is having mass but they do so how much would that be if I had what if I had two kilograms of co2 like how much is that right if you could see it and if you could see it it would be it could feel cube that's about one meter on a side so we call that one cubic meter and one cubic meter is about one thousand liters okay so think if I for every kilowatt hour that I use in electricity I have to burn one kilogram of coal which makes two kilograms of co2 which would fill up a thousand liters of co2 gas okay so that's those are the numbers we've been using this class to do the problems but they're all kind of similar so here's an example so let's say I have a TV that uses 330 watts and I have this TV on let's say six hours a day all right and let's say I do this every single day for a month so we'll say 30 days okay so here's the scenario how much ultimately here's what I want to know how much co2 did I put in the atmosphere because of this right so to answer that we've got to figure out how many kilowatt hours how much coal and how much co2 then it all starts on these problems with figuring out the kilowatt hours if you know the kilowatt hours you can get to all the other things you need to solve for all right so that's we're going to do first we're going to figure out how much energy did this take so energy is power times time what's my power 330 watts what's my time okay so it's got to be in hours it's six hours a day but I'm doing this for 30 days so my total hours is 6 times 30 so it's multiply all that out so I've got 330 oops 330 times 6 times 30 equals 59400 what hours okay so 4000 divided by a thousand turn it into kilowatt hours so I'm gonna divide by a thousand and that gives me fifty nine point four kWh all right this is what we need to do the rest so for every kill we see in the beginning for every kilowatt hour I need to burn one kilogram or 2.2 pounds of coal so let's say I ask you pounds of coal how many pounds of coal did I have to burn in that month right so I take my fifty nine point four kilowatt hours times two point two pounds oops 2.2 pounds of coal for every kilowatt hour so I just take that number fifty nine point four times two point two and I get 130 point seven pounds so that's how many pounds of coal I had to burn that month for my TV so how much co2 did I make well if I ask for say pounds of co2 then I would go back to my fifty nine point fifty nine point four kilowatt hours times four point four so I get four point four pounds of co2 for every kilowatt hour and now I can just take the one I just got and I get two sixty one point four pounds of co2 so that's pounds of a gas how many liters is that I go back to the kilowatt hours and multiply by a thousand so if I go back to how many liters of co2 then I go back to my kilowatt hours which is fifty nine point four times a thousand liters per every kilowatt hour and that's pretty easy math 59400 liters of co2 so in all these problems you go back to the kilowatt hours and multiply that by two point two or one or a thousand depending on what your what you're trying to solve for or what if the cost financial cost let's say you're charging me eleven cents a kilowatt hour how much money does that cost me to run my TV per month I take fifty nine point four kilowatt hours times eleven cents per kilowatt hour and fifty nine point four times point one one and I get six dollars and 53 cents so if you compare these two things the financial cost in this country is very low to generating that's actually quite a bit of electricity if you had to do that manually by cranking something I mean it would take you weeks of work to do this only costs us $6.50 and yet it produces close to sixty thousand liters of co2 into the atmosphere so this is one of the problems that we deal with in environmental science that there is a financial cost which is not very big and there's an environmental cost which can be huge nobody's paying for this upfront right we pay for this but this is really the cost that we're worried about in in this class okay so let's do another example let's say I've got a 60 watt let's see let's say I got 60 watt porch light in the front and I got a hundred watt porch light in the back of my house alright so one in the front one in the back and they're on 24 hours a day how much coal do I need to burn for these just these two light bulbs in a year so I got to get my kilowatt hours first okay what's my power I've got 60 water and 100 water what's my time 24 hours all year long times 365 so that gives me 160 watts times 24 times 365 hours so i have 160 times 24 times 365 I get 1 million 400 1600 watt hours okay I got divided by thousand to turn it into kilowatt hours so divided by thousand and I get 1400 1.6 kilowatt hours and this is remember for the whole year how many pounds of coal let's say I ask that question so so what we said is if you know your kilowatt hours multiply that by 2.2 so I take one thousand four hundred and one kilowatt hours 2.2 pounds so one thousand four hundred and one point six times two point two and I get three thousand eighty three point five pounds of coal oops pounds of coal all right liters of co2 I go back to my kilowatt hours and it's a thousand liters for every kilowatt hour so that gets me 1 million for 1600 liters the co2 how about cost let's say it costs 13 cents kilowatt hour then I go back to my kilowatt hours 1401 point 6 times 13 cents 1401 point 6 times 0.1 3 I get $182 and 21 cents ok so that's the cost in terms of financial and the cost in terms of the environmental of leaving those two light bulbs on 24 hours a day so these problems can get more and more complicated but it's the same math every time its power times time so we'll do one more that's slightly more complicated so you can see how you might do something like this so we could have a scenario such as this I've got a 60 watt porch light and it's on for 12 hours a day 12 hours a day I have a 210 watt TV it's on for 4 hours a day inside I have two 120 watt lamps they are on for 6 hours a day what is my carbon footprint for the year okay so we're assuming the same usage every day so what does carbon footprint mean how much coal did I burn how much co2 co2 did I produce alright so same math energy is power times time I guy add it all up and do all the math so I can do a piecewise so in other words I can say all right let's do the porch lights I've got 60 watts times 12 hours times 365 days a year I've got the TV the TV is 210 watts times 4 hours times 365 I got the lamps I've got 120 watt lamps but there's two of them and they're on for six hours a day times 365 ok so so I'm just dividing each one of these up each time power times time and I can do each one and then add them all up so 60 times 12 times 365 I get 2 moves 260 2800 watt hours for the TVs I get 210 times four times three six two five three hundred six thousand six hundred watt hours and for the lamps I get home 20 times two times six times 365 525,600 watt hours now what I'm going to do is go ahead and and divide each of those by a thousand and turn them into kWh so that gift gets me to sixty two point eight KW h 3o 6.6 kWh five twenty five point six kwh add them all up take my two sixty two point eight plus three o six point six plus five twenty five point six equals thousand ninety five kilowatt hours per year okay so now if I said all right how much how many kilograms of coal would we have to burn for this so then we'll do a couple here so kilograms of coal well I can take that many kilowatt hours thousand ninety-five one kilogram one kilogram of co2 oops I'm sorry one kilogram of coal for every kilowatt hour means I get one thousand that thousand ninety five kilograms of coal alright that's pretty easy calculation you're just multiplying by one right well if I said pounds of coal all right then I got a thousand ninety five kilowatt hours times 2.2 pounds per coal sorry pounds per kilowatt-hour so I just take that multiply that by two point two and you get 24 oh nine pounds of coal or what if I said how many liters of co2 I go back to my kilowatt hours and multiply that by a thousand thousand liters per kilowatt hour and I get 109 500 so a million 95 thousand liters a co2 okay etc right so so that the problems are all of the similar nature get it to kilowatt hours multiply it by one of those factors get the answer
