so if we want to reduce our carbon footprint then we can either not use electricity as much as possible or we can try to replace something that's inefficient with something that's more efficient that does the same job but uses less electricity in the example we're going to use in this class as with lightbulbs so we're gonna we're going to learn a little bit about different types of types of light bulb technology and then we'll do some math problems on how to calculate how much carbon you would save by swapping out different types of light bulbs so right now on the market for consumer there's three basic types of light bulbs there's the incandescent the compact fluorescent and the light-emitting diode also known as LEDs okay so incandescent these things have been around since the late 1800s these are the of all the things in your house that use electricity if you have an incandescent light bulb it is the most obsolete by far okay and the way it works is that there's this little wire in here called the filament it's made of tungsten and the electricity flows through this wire and it gets so hot that it glows now it turns out they're very very inefficient and you can think of it as like a heater that happens to make some light so if you go up to a 60 watt or a hundred watt light bulb or even a 40 watt light bulb and you you try to put your hand on it you can't it's just it's too hot it's mostly just making heat instead of light so if you did the math which we're not going to do it's like about one percent efficient so if you put a hundred Watts in you're getting one watt of light out and all the rest is heat now pros they're very cheap to make so like I know 25 cents a piece or something like that and there's a lot of people who think this is the way light bulbs should look they like the look of this style light bulb okay but cons very very inefficient so then and starting in the 40s people started making 4s lights and at first enter these long tubes about eight feet long and then people figure out how to miniaturize it so that you can fit them in a small socket and inside this this is a glass tube that has a little tiny amount of mercury in it like a milligram of mercury and this funny white plastic base here has a high voltage power supply and what it does is when the light goes on it excites the mercury atoms and the electrons the outer electrons in the mercury as they jump back and forth between their different orbitals and that produces light and it's much more efficient than it make an incandescent light bulb so this is a big improvement over the incandescent lights but the problem the problem is is that it has a little bit of mercury mercury is very poisonous as we learned in an earlier lecture so when this bulb is burned out you're not supposed to just throw it away because if it goes in the landfill and then the glass breaks and then the mercury gets out and gets into the groundwater so disposal is a big problem with compact fluorescents but they are more efficient they use less electricity so and by the way another con these compacts have been around since the 70s in the last decade they got pretty good to where it was hard for most people to even tell if you had one or not but the early models were really ugly to look at the light just didn't quite look right there's a weird color now within the last few years we're in the era of light-emitting diodes and this has been a huge revolution in lighting so in an LED there's actual silicon chip it's the same technology as a computer chip and when the electricity flows through it it produces light and how that happens is pretty complicated we're just going to kind of skip that part but inside here there's a bunch of chips and they're flat and they're in this case they're they're lined up horizontally and they're shooting the light straight up so then what they do is they put a diffuser on top to scatter the light in all directions so that chip is called a light-emitting diode so this called the LED light they last a very long time you can make them any color they're very efficient if you see an LED you put your hand on it it's it's barely warm and they have been traditionally LEDs have been very expensive to make just in the last few years that's really radically changed and now there's really no excuse not to switch your bulbs over to LEDs I mean I have a catalog from like 20 years ago when one single LED bulb is over a hundred dollars and now you can get like three of them for 10 bucks at Home Depot and there there's just tons of them out now this is what an LED looks like if you were to take it apart here's the little chips and they're oriented so that they fire the light comes perpendicular from the surface so this one would be like a spotlight light only goes in one direction which is why they have to put a diffuser on it to scatter the light in all directions but they're coming out with all kinds of things so for example there are now these bulbs that have this old-school light bulb appearance with the filaments but the filaments themselves are actually a little tiny silicon chips they are a little tiny versions of this that light up and you can't tell the difference when they're lit up I mean most people can't tell the difference between the modern LEDs and the old old-style Bowl Edison bulbs so this is really changing lighting technology so there's there are similar stories with with a lot of the technology in are in their homes so for example 10 years ago a plasma television 65 inch plasma television used close to 800 watts now the same size television using LEDs for the lighting eighty-eight Watts right huge difference and all the computers used more electricity or refrigerators use more electricity we could go on and on through all kinds of technology but in this class what we're going to do is we're going to do some math with bulb replacements and it's the same math that we've done before but this time it's we're gonna swap out one bulb for another okay so I'm going to do an example of a bulb replacement type problem and they're pretty straightforward is just kind of common sense you're going to do the you're going to do the math with the old bulb you're going to do the math of the new bulb and subtract the differences okay so let's say I've got a hundred watt porch light and this thing is on for 12 hours a day okay and I'm going to replace it so this is incandescent right I should I should have said that incandescent I'm gonna replace this with a 12 watt LED okay and I'm gonna my usage is not going to change I'm just gonna leave it on 24 hours a day no I'm sorry 12 hours a day okay so 100 watt light bulb incandescent for 12 hours a day I swap it out with a 12 watt LED that makes the same amount of light but it only uses 12 Watts 12 hours a day how much do I save in a year that's the question right so how much do I save in a year and we can ask this question several ways we could that could be coal that could be co2 that could be money okay so solve for the old bulb solve for the new bulb subtract the difference that's the easiest way to think about this all right so the old bulb I got now remember on these problems we got to get to kilowatt hours before we can do anything else so I'm gonna use my energies power times time and I need to figure out how much energy the old bulb is gonna use in a year okay so in one year oops one year I've got the 100 watt light bulb 12 hours a day hours times 365 and I'm just gonna go ahead and divide by a thousand to get it into kilowatt hours right away so I take 100 times 12 times 365 divided by a thousand and that gets me 438 kilowatt hours all right now if you wanted to do it separate steps you could I just kind of did an all one thing there now this is the old bulb all right the new bulb is 12 Watts 12 hours a day 365 days in the year and when I go ahead and divide by a thousand to convert it to kilowatt hours and twelve times twelve times 365 divided by a thousand equals 52 0.56 kilowatt hours okay so here's the old here's the new right so I can do this I can do this next math one of several ways I will do it the way that I think makes the most sense but if you know what's going on you can you can you can alter this method what I would do to just make this easy as possible let's say we're going to calculate how much money we save right let's calculate the amount of money we save from doing this right the way to do this again more than one wait but the way I'm going to do it is figure out the amount for the old bulb figure out the amount for the new bulb and then subtract all right I think that's the most straightforward way of thinking about this so the old bulb let's say we're charged 13 cents a kilowatt-hour right if I use that number the old bulb 438 kilowatt hours times 13 cents and the new bulb is 52 0.56 kilowatt hours times 13 cents right so let's 438 times point one three is fifty six dollars and ninety four cents and the new bulb point 56 times point one three is six dollars and eighty three cents and then I'm going to subtract the two so the difference is $56 94 cents - six dollars 83 cents so 56 point ninety four minus six point eight three is fifty dollars eleven cents okay so this is how much money I saved so I calculated the dollars for the old bulb the dollars from the new bulb subtract the two okay same technique to solve any other question if I asked okay well how much coal did I save from this it'd be the same way so let's let's just do that let's say I have coal saved for example the old bulb I go back to the kilowatt hours I had four hundred thirty-eight kilowatt hours and what's doing pounds okay how many pounds of coal is that is 2.2 pounds per kilowatt-hour do that math for 38 times 2.2 is 960 3.6 pounds that's the old one and then the new one is 50 2.56 kilowatt hours 2.2 pounds per kilowatt hour so I take 52 point five six times two point two and I get a hundred and fifteen point six pounds that's the old one and if I wanna know how much coal did I save how much coal do I not have to burn now because I replaced that one light bulb the coal saved is the difference between those which is 960 3.6 pounds minus one hundred fifteen point six pounds and nine sixty three point six minus one one five point six is eight hundred and forty eight pounds saved so one of the themes here notice all he did is I took one single light bulb and I replaced it right that's it nothing else changed except that one light bulb and by me doing that I save 850 pounds of coal every year so now imagine I did that to all the bulbs in my house and now imagine everybody else in the United States does the same thing and what happens is we start to realize you could save so much coal that we could actually shut off mini coal fire power plants would we want to even need them that's how much coal you could save by just swapping light bulbs so once in a while you might see a billboard there used to be some in town I haven't seen them in the while and it talks about you know if every person just were to change one light bulb in their house then you know X would happen that's actually true because if there's 350 million of us in the United States alone and we all just replaced one light bulb then take that number multiply it by 350 million and suddenly you've got lots of coal that you're saving from getting burning going into the atmosphere
