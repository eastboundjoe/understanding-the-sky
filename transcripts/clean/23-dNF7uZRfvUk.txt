hi I'm Mel and in this lecture we're going to talk about the reasons why you should recycle aluminum cans so we've been talking about electricity and it's related to that but let's start out with talking about one of the reasons why we do not recycle aluminum so aluminum is not a rare element that's some thing we need to establish if I look at all of the the common elements that's in the crust of the earth number one is oxygen number two is silicon number three is aluminum okay seven and a half percent of everything in the crust is aluminum now it's not pure aluminum metal it's aluminum mixed in with other elements to form minerals point being we don't recycle aluminum because aluminum itself is rare there's other reason there's another reason why so let's talk about how we actually get aluminum metal and so what we're working up towards is the steps to get from this material which is called bauxite and it's these red blogs that have aluminum bearing minerals in there we're going to work towards the step from this rock to say an aluminum can like what is required okay so bauxite is a mixture of these red blobs and from a distance bauxite often has this reddish appearance and bauxite forms wherever you had a lot of precipitation for a long period of time so what happens is all of the rains so think of like a rain forest what rains almost every day it reaches the soil away and the only components that are left over are these aluminum burying compounds called bauxite so what we're looking at here is a remnant of a ancient soil that is left over from an era where there's a lot of precipitation so you might have an area that's tropical today and there's lots of rain and that's leaving behind the bauxite or you might find a remnant of an ancient box I'd soil from the geologic past either way this red material that's left behind after all of that precipitation contains a lot of this mineral bauxite so first thing they got to do is just simply dig it up and so that's what they're doing here you see all this red box site in the foreground here and bauxite mines are very red like everything's red because this bauxite mineral itself is red so here's one from the from the air you can see the roads are red the mine mining areas are red here the buildings are red everything in this in this photo is kind of a reddish tint this is all bauxite that's being mined now you can kind of see the where there's runoff from a bauxite mine because it it will also be red so this was a river and it's filled with this reddish muck here that's bauxite runoff here's a here's a place where there there was an overflow of a river and you can see this reddish material that went through here that's again from a bauxite mine there are some places in the world where bauxite is being mined it gets into the water so you see this reddish in this waterway here that's from a nearby bauxite mine in this town here you can see all the red so this is a road that leads to bauxite mines there's trucks that go by here every day and some of the material falls off and you can see all that reddish stuff so bauxite you know the mining process itself is you just it's pretty simple you dig it out of the ground but of course a lot of it somehow runs off into the environment so they crush the bauxite into sand sized pieces and then they usually haul it on a barge so they're filling up these ships here and here there here are some barges with bauxite sitting in in the bay there here you can see the little piles of red bauxite here's a big ship that's full of bauxite inside and they haul it off to a smelter ok so here's a smelter and it's built near near a waterway like a bay or something because they're expecting these shipments of bauxite a smelter is a plant that is going to take that red bauxite material and split it apart so that we have aluminum metal okay so we're going to go from from bauxite grains to pure metal that's what a smelter does and we're going to talk about the stages here so here's a smelter right there and here's what they're doing in there so the problem is bauxite itself is a mixture of things and they want to purify it to this pier to a compound al2o3 so there is other stuff mixed in there and they want to get rid of it they want pure al2o3 so what they do is they take the bauxite remember it's been crushed up now and they subjected to heat and pressure and water and sodium hydroxide which is kind of like Drano so it's a strong base and they cook it and what happens is all the stuff that's not al2o3 gets dissolved away and here's an image of a smelter and you can see all these smokestacks which tells you that there's probably some air pollution being produced here and this process is one of the things that that produces some of the pollution in this process but at the end of all that you have al2o3 which we also call alumina okay now after that chemical separation we have a the biggest problem of all which is that what we want is pure aluminum al we don't want the oxygen in there but we don't have that we have al 2o3 and it turns out that the bond between the oxygen and the aluminum is very strong so from chemistry if we draw out what al 2o3 looks like here's our aluminum we've got these double bonds here on the oxygen and we have to break those bonds and it turns out it's very difficult to do so the way that it's done is they mix in this chemical cryolite which is sodium aluminum fluoride which is itself a pretty nasty chemical and they mix it in with this al2o3 and they put it in this big vat and then they run a very strong electrical current through it what'll happen is as the current runs through this mixture the pure aluminum that essentially it breaks the those bonds those double oxygen bonds and it the pure aluminum metal sinks to the bottom as a liquid and then they come in they extract that liquid from the bottom of the VAT so this is what it looks like so you can see this glowing reddish color here these are the electrodes so the VAT is below the ground electricity the current is coming down through these electrodes going down into below the ground here and they're running hundreds of thousands of amps through this mixture and what floats two against sinks to the bottom is the aluminum metal and this thing is like a vacuum cleaner and it's sucking up the aluminium metal off the bottom that's what they're doing and so what they'll do is they'll just go down the line here you can see these things all the way down to the end of this building they're all doing this this takes a lot of electricity so each one of these vats that you see here has a set of electrodes each of which is going through thousands of amps so from what we talked about before it's going through each one of the each one of these is hundreds of thousands of watts so this is another picture what that looks like so here's their aluminum sucker upper and here's all that the VATS so it requires so much electricity to do this that often in the in the entrance of an aluminum smelter you'll you'll see this huge network of incoming power lines and sometimes they need so much electricity that they actually have their own power plant so here is a smelter that's these are long gate buildings in the background that's the smelter and then this is a cold fire power plant you can see there's the coal piled up right there so this this aluminum smelter needs so much electricity that they actually have their own coal-fired power plant here's one in Eastern Washington that has its own dam so there's the smelter you see the elongate buildings there's the hydroelectric dam so so water is going through a turbine which turns magnets which generates electricity and so that's how they get enough power to run the smelter so if we add up the electricity that it would take to develop a brand new aluminum can from that bauxite mineral it turns out it takes about 350 watt hours of energy to make one aluminum can from scratch if you instead recycle a can all they have to do is melt it down they don't have to split the aluminum oxygen bonds and it takes about 5% of that so we can do some math with this so it takes 350 watt hours to make one aluminum can we could ask questions like this so how much coal would you need to make 12 cans all right so we have a 12 pack of aluminum cans of soda cans whatever and we want to know how much coal did we have to burn to do that so from last time these are the we're going to use the same numbers as last time you get your power and kilowatt hours they're from kilowatt hours you multiply that by two point two for the pounds of coal or times a thousand for the leaders of co2 etc all the things that we did before so my energy is 350 watt hours times I get 12 of them so I just take 350 times 12 and get 4200 watt hours and to convert that's kilowatt hours I divide by a thousand and I get 4.2 kWh okay so that's how much energy it takes to make a 12-pack how much coal is that so let's say I ask for coal in pounds then all I have to do is take this 4.2 and multiply 2.2 pounds per kilowatt-hour and four point two times two point two is nine point two four okay so it's helped us nine point two four pounds of coal to make a 12-pack of cans how much co2 is that so I go back to my kilowatt hours and multiply by a thousand and I get four point two kilowatt hours times a thousand liters for every kilowatt hour gives me 4200 liters of co2 okay so that's what's required to make our cans 12-pack of cans so if I throw them away then I've got to expend this much you'll burn this much coal and produce this much co2 to make another twelve but if I recycle them they can just melt them down and make new ones and it only takes about 5% of that there's another set of problems we can do we could say something like this let's let's imagine that I I've got a computer a little laptop that uses 14 watts okay so imagine pretty you know a fairly modern small laptop and I want to know if I took those twelve cans and I just threw them away instead of recycling them I'm throwing away energy right throwing away the electricity that it would take because I got to make 12 new cans how long could I run a computer with that electricity that I just threw away by tossing those cans right so how long could I run a computer on the electricity it takes to make 12 new cans okay so again the idea is if I throw a lovely weekend away I must not recycle it I got expend a bunch of energy to make a new one so if I had a 14 watt computer how long could I use that computer how long could I run it on 12 cans worth of energy so the formula I'm going to use to figure this out is the same one we've done before energy is power times time okay so what's my energy my energy is how much energy it took to make 12 cans we just solve that we said it was 4.2 kilowatt hours and the power is 14 watts times time we don't know what time is that's what we're solving for so this is an algebra problem where we're just going to divide both sides and isolate time but there's one step we have to do and that is this we we did a conversion to get watt hours to kilowatt hours so what we have to do is get rid of that K before we can do the math because we got one hour we got watts over here we're gonna have times that in hours as an answer we got to get rid of this K so I'm gonna go back to what we had before this 4200 right here and I'm gonna put that in I'm just kidding I'm just going backwards multiple getting rid of stead of dividing by a thousand multiplying a thousand to get rid of the K just I'm gonna write this out watt hours equals 14 watts times time okay so now I'm going to divide both sides by 14 Lots so I take 4200 divided by 14 and I get 300 hours so so that means I could turn that computer on and leave it on continuously for 300 hours on the electricity would take to make 12 new cans so we could even let's divide that by 24 and that's 12 and a half days so the point being that when we don't recycle in the aluminum can we're essentially throwing late electricity that could be used for something else okay so to recap the process if you mine about 4 tons of bauxite the mineral and then you run it through that chemical digestion process you get about 2 tons of alumina which is al2o3 you don't want al2o3 you want pure aluminum and you run it through that second process that that's the part that takes all of the electricity and you get one ton of actual aluminum metal so because it takes a lot of electricity to make cans we'd like to recycle as many as possible it turns out as a country we're really bad at doing this so here's an old old graph that was published in 2002 and it looks at how how many says thousands of tons per year of lunar cans were thrown away in the United States right so there weren't really too many aluminum cans before 1970 so the graph kind of starts in 1970 and what we see is that as time has gone on and as aluminum cans became more and more popular we just threw more and more of them away right so they they calculated in this in again this is where the year 2001 so in 1972 2001 that 16mm tons of aluminum was just simply thrown away over that time period and if you look at a more modern records we really have not gotten any better so here's I from 96 to 2015 we're looking at how how well we have recycled aluminum and so there's a there's the blue line in a red line for industry and consumers but the point is is here's a 50% mark right so we are recycling a little bit better than half of the cans and then you can see it dips back down again and then it gets better so the red line you can imagine that's us as consumers and it's hovering around the 50% mark so in other words we pretty much throw away about half of our aluminum cans and when I teach this cost face to face usually in a college classroom I will go over to the garbage can at this point and I'll open it and I guarantee there are aluminum cans in the trash and right next to the trash was usually a recycling bin so in other words it's not even it doesn't even require any effort to do the recycling people simply just don't care back to that 2002 paper they were they were looking at again they're calculating how many aluminum cans were wasted from 1972 in this case to 2000 so there's a couple interesting numbers here one is how much electricity did we throw away it says exactly half of all US homes for one year so in other words we could power half of it all the homes in the United States for a year on the electricity that we threw away essentially from aluminum cans alone or you can do equivalent that's equivalent is fifteen thousand seven hundred ninety six million gallons of gasoline are 342 million barrels of oil that's how much an energy equivalent that we threw away during that time period so a couple more statistics every six months we throw away enough aluminum to rebuild the world supply of commercial planes so airplanes are made of aluminum because aluminum is very light so every six months we could just replace all the commercial airlines and airplanes in the world based on the amount of cans that we throw away the electricity that we could save each year by recycling the throwing away cans would would be enough electricity to power three million US homes so three million houses we could power each year just on the cans or chucking so when we make new cans remember it takes 350 watt hours per can plus you've got the bauxite mining and all the runoff from that you've got the air pollution from the chemical digestion process all the greenhouse gases that we're making all those things count so why do we recycle cans not because aluminum is rare because it's not because it takes so much electricity to make it can that's why
