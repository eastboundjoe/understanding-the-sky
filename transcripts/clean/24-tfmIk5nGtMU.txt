[0:06] hey this is Mel strong and in this lecture we're going to be talking about renewable energy so the first source of renewable energy we're going to talk about is the Sun and so we're going to talk about how we might be able to use the Sun to generate electricity or how to harness the Sun for other things so in the previous lecture we talked about how electricity is generated and we talked about the steam turbine and we said that there is this apparatus that's got a bunch of

[0:36] looks like fan blades and steam comes in and pushes these blades and this entire thing spins and as it spins it turns a magnetic field in circles and that's next to a conductor generates electricity and so last time we talked about well what would make steam and and around most of the world the way this is done is we burn fossil fuels that generates heat that boils water that makes steam so could we use the Sun to

[1:10] make steam and this is one thing that could be done is if you can imagine if you could concentrate the heat of the Sun to boil water then you could use a steam turbine in the in the entire apparatus that we talked about before for generating electricity except instead of burning coal we can use this Sun so here we've got a bunch of parabolic mirrors and in the center of the mirror the other is a glass tube and the Sun is being reflected to the center

[1:42] of these tubes and inside the tube is a fluid that gets heated to way beyond the boiling point of water and then it gets piped over to this in the background there's a steam turbine over here and just like in the coal-fired power plant the boils water makes steam towards a turbine turns magnets and generates electricity now the flue that they use a lot of times is salt not salt water just

[2:12] actually pure salt and if you heat up salt thousands of degrees it will melt and act like a fluid and so that's what they actually use for most of these is their salt that's so hot it's molten and it flows in these glass tubes and again you can see there's the the generator in the background there so here is a an installation and and by the way this is called concentrated solar power that's the term that's used for this kind of technology so you have rows and rows of

[2:43] these parabolic reflectors with a little glass tube in the center with melting salt and all of this is sent over to the power plant that's over here now one of the advantages of using this concentrated solar power is that that salt gets so hot that it actually stays hot overnight and it will continue to generate steam overnight so this is a solar power technology that generates electricity in the dark because it gets

[3:13] so hot during the day and it retains as heat throughout the night here's another version of it Sandia Labs is actually working been working on this these are mirrors and they all reflect the Sun to this capsule and this capsule is something called a Stirling engine it's a heat powered engine and so as one side of this is hot and the other side is cooler it that temperature difference will will cause this little engine to run and they can generate electricity that way here's another version of that

[3:45] there's a parabolic mirror and again one of those Stirling engines that's a generating electricity on the end here here's an installation and I think this is in Australia where they have several of these dishes and you can kind of get a sense there this one is glowing you know it's pretty hot on one side there as is this one and and apparently these dishes so they track the Sun so they're always reflecting the Sun to this Stirling engine that's enough to

[4:17] generate generates enough electricity for a small town and this is not a new idea so here's one from 1901 this is a solar-powered steam engine and so it's the same idea that you've got parabolic mirrors that are blowing water here that makes steam and turns a probably a piston on this one instead of a turbine but this is a solar-powered steam engines this is an old idea but this is very expensive to make and coal

[4:50] is super cheap so these really didn't catch on because why would you go through the expense of building all this because you're gonna shovel coal for next to nothing and you don't need to deal with all that so these really never caught on another version of this is sometimes called the Tower of Power and there's these are all mirrors down here and the mirrors are on a tracking system so they're tracking the Sun and they're always reflecting the Sun so that it lands on this capsule up here which is

[5:21] at the top of this tower and inside that capsule is molten salt so it works just like the ones I've been talking about the first ones with the parabolic mirrors with molten salt it's just that this version the mirrors are moving and reflecting the Sun to this one spot here's one that's in Nevada that's just recently come on the line and it gets so hot that this the top of this tower glows pretty brightly like you can't even look at it and there

[5:51] there's been some complaints actually of pilots that are flying in the area that say it's too bright to look at now there another one again you can see the the capsule appear glowing in all these mirrors tracking the Sun reflecting it onto that one spot and again the big advantage here is that you can use steam turbine technology CDs so that's all the same from coal-fired power plants and it gets so hot during the day it'll continue to generate electricity during

[6:21] the night here's one from above so you can see all these mirrors it's kind of like they're all worshiping their leader that's in the center here or this one a lot of these pictures are from Europe these are more popular in Europe than they are in the United States because they're very expensive too so mostly only the countries that don't have a lot of fossil fuels have been investing in this we only have a couple of them so far so here's two of them and

[6:51] there's one tower there one tower there so inside this system we're not going to go too deep here but here's the mirrors here's that capsule that gets white-hot and inside there is molten salt and the molten salt goes through kind of a loop or exchanges heat with the water so this part is what's boiling the water with that molten salt and then it goes into this turbine that's what this is so the

[7:21] fan blades and and then that turns the generator that's this part and then that generates the electricity and then there's a cooling system for the turbine and that's what this part is but okay now there's another way that we can harness the heat of the Sun to help save electricity and one is you could have a couple panels on your roof that help heat water so usually what happens is so every house has a water heater it might

[7:51] be gas might be electric and normally cold water from the ground goes into the tank so here here's the tank and then you've got electricity or natural gas that heats that water up to you know 140 degrees or whatever it is so what a water a preheater for your water heater does is the cold water coming from the ground moves through these boxes and in these boxes are just some pipes that are sitting in the Sun and it pre heats the

[8:22] water before it goes into the water heater so if the ground water is say 40 degrees and so normally without without this system you'd have 40 degree water going into your water heater and having to warm that up from 40 to 140 let's say you might run it through these pre heaters these solar pre heaters and it might warm it from 40 maybe to 80 or 90 so then you've got 90 degree water going in and you have to warm 90 degree water

[8:52] to 140 which doesn't take you as much energy so this is what these look like so again inside they're just some pipes so they're pretty simple there's no really any moving parts no electricity it's just using heat from the Sun another thing that people can do is they can use the Sun to actually heat the air and so Sun hits this collector and inside this box gets very warm and there's a system that vents the warm air into the house so here's an example or

[9:22] there's one that put it on your roof it's pretty simple there's just a fan that blows air from inside the house into this glass box and then that warms up and then and then the fan pushes it out and it just sits there all day and helps heat your house and other version okay so everything we've talked about so far is using the heat of the Sun to either generate electricity or help save

[9:52] electricity but the big technology that everybody has been using especially in this country to generate electricity is that a photovoltaic cells a photovoltaic cell means you use the Sun the photo to generate electricity volts photovoltaic now how these work is pretty complicated we're not going to get into it but it uses semiconductors there's three layers of semiconductors which is mostly

[10:22] silicon except doped with a tiny amount of something else okay and we're not going to get into it except to say that when you have sandwiched layers of silicon doped with other materials and the light hits it electrons will be pushed from one side and tried to get to the other side so before we took a magnet and we moved it next to a conductor and that made the electrons move here what's happening is with these three layers of semiconductors mostly

[10:52] silicon hit with photons of light electrons will try to move through this circuit that's all we really need to know here so it's kind of similar to an LED light so you think back last lecture we talked about LEDs light emitting diodes and we use them as light and they were these these little square wafers that when you put a voltage on them it makes a light it's the same kind of process but in Reverse you hit it

[11:22] with a light turns into a voltage so each little solar cell might be that you put in your hand for the most part and they're not very powerful so you put that thing in the Sun you'll make a very small but measurable non electricity but you can't really power anything important with it you could not power a house with this for example you might be able to power like a little tiny light or something so what we do is we wire a whole bunch of these solar cells

[11:52] together and there's different terminology but these if you put a whole bunch of these together into this calls it a module or you might call it a panel and you know take a bunch of these modules together to make an array and the word these words are kind of fuzzy because this might be called a module or panel this thing here might be called a module or an array and then if you wire

[12:23] a bunch of these together that's also sometimes called an array not too worried about the terminology but here's a whole bunch of them together so each one of these little squares is a solar cell and then each one of these might be called a module or a panel and then all together all of these together usually call on the Ray or sometimes a solar farm so all the solar cells in this in this diagram are all working together to generate electricity enough to actually

[12:54] do something useful so as I can armie a Smurf's like one a little Smurf doesn't do anything but you get like a million of them and they can do something that's kind of what they're doing with solar here's another example right so you know there's hundreds of thousands of individual solar cells all working in unison to try to generate electricity now sometimes they are on trackers that's the most efficient way so what that means is they're following the Sun so they're always getting the maximum sunlight trackers are very expensive

[13:25] okay so these ones I showed you in the past they don't have any tracking system they're just pointed in one direction generally you just point them towards the south part of the sky these are on trackers as are these so they will move throughout the day and that gives you the most energy but again it's the most expensive well at U and M on the main campus we actually have a couple of arrays so if you park on campus there's the Yale parking structure so right here that's Lomas and the hospital is kind of

[13:57] off the it's up in the corner off the diagram here but on the top of the Yale parking structure are a series of solar panels it's rated at the 180 kilowatt 180,000 Watts okay so that's how much power is being generated when the Sun is directly shining on it this is what it looks like up close and you can actually park your car underneath these solar panels also on the science and math

[14:27] learning center building there is another array that's not quite as big but here's what that looks like I'm just using Google Earth to look down on these you can also get you can put a solar array on your house so a lot of you know if your house is oriented in the right direction like if this is a south-facing roof then that's a convenient spot to put solar panels or like these so it used to be that solar panels were so

[14:59] expensive that you rarely ever saw a house with that with with solar panels with photovoltaic cells now they've been getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper too now you're starting to see this more and more as a more and more common thing so let's say you wanted to convert your house to solar there's a couple different ways to do it the easy way to do it is let's say you live in a city like Albuquerque and you're connected to what we call the grid so normal electricity right so the easiest way to

[15:31] do this is you invest in solar panels and you invest in thing called an inverter and what the inverter does is it converts the electricity from the solar panels to something that the electric company could actually use and so if you live in certain cities in Albuquerque's one of them our local power company in this case PNM is required to buy that electricity from you during the day so you got solar panels on your roof but you're not home and you're not using an electricity you can sell it to the

[16:01] electric company during the day and they pay you per kilowatt hour now Sun Goes Down your home you need electricity your solar panels are not working during the night you buy electricity back from the power company so the idea here is you sell it to rent you sell it to them during the day you buy it from them during the night and hopefully you either break even or if you have a lot of solar panels you might even make a little money doing this so people that have a lot of solar panels on the roof are actually generating a little income

[16:32] each month if they're selling more than they're using so this is what the yell parking structure at UNM does they during the day they're generating electricity they're selling it to PNM then at night the whole parking structure is lit up and they have to buy electricity back from PNM and they hope that they break even now if you're not connected to the grid let's say you want a solar power house out in the boonies

[17:02] or you live in a town where the electric company will not buy your electricity gets a lot more complicated because what are you gonna do at night and what you have to do is you have to have a big bank of batteries and if you use the amount of electricity that most Americans do you really need a lot of batteries to store that much electricity so during the day your solar cells your solar panels would be charging a enormous Bank of batteries like what's shown in this picture and then at night

[17:33] you are using the electricity from those batteries now how this would work is your solar panels go to something called a charge controller which charged the batteries right so during the day is charging the batteries then at night the batteries go to something called an inverter which takes the voltage of the batteries and converts it to something that your standard 110 volt thing can could use that's what an inverter does and that powers the house one of this advantages of doing this is well what happens if

[18:04] you get say a cloudy day or two cloudy days in a row or you think about those mid-latitude cyclones if you live in that part of the country you might have five cloudy days in a row you're in trouble because you don't have any way generating electricity during the day so a lot of people that live this way also have like a backup generator or maybe some wind turbines to help out one thing that a lot of people don't realize is that solar cells are not entirely green and so they work very similar to

[18:36] computer chips there are silicon wafers as we talked about that's a very messy process it takes a lot of chemicals that generates a lot of waste uses a lot of electricity so a lot of our solar cells or solar panels are coming from China and China doesn't have the pollution controls that we do and we've talked about how terrible the air quality in China is a lot of that at least a portion of it is coming from the manufacture of solar panels so it's not entirely green it takes a lot of energy

[19:07] to make them and that makes a lot of pollution once you have them yeah they will continue making clean energy as long as they still are around but the manufacturing process is pretty dirty so if we look at a map of well so this one says photovoltaics all the solar resources of the United States where would you go to generate the most solar electricity and probably not surprising but we New Mexico and Arizona Southern

[19:38] California have the most hours of sunlight per year now you can actually see the pattern here that is the effect of the Pacific subtropical high again right so remember we've got that sinking air from the Hadley cell keeps it very dry in this part of the country therefore we have many hours of available sunlight so almost all in New Mexico's Cape generating at least six kilowatt hours per square meter per day right so if you

[20:08] had enough solar panels out there you could generate six kilowatt hours for every square meter so pros and cons then once you have the solar panel made 100% free of greenhouse gases right doesn't make any noise doesn't produce any air pollution cons they've been very expensive to make but in recent years they've become much much cheaper photovoltaic cells only work during the day so storage is a problem unless

[20:40] you're connected to the grid of course if you're using the molten-salt you know that concentrated solar power those things I can work all night because they you just get so hot can be used in all parts of the world right if you live up in the middle of Canada in the winter good luck you're not going to have any sunlight the manufacturing processes manufacturing process is messy and consumes energy so it's not completely free of carbon right so so without

[21:12] turning things political you can't avoid some of the politics that have been going on about solar so our current administration the Trump administration has been very anti solar for the most part so for example our current EPA chief Scott Pruett as soon as he got in office he said he's going to get rid of the solar tax credits which are designed to help homeowners get solar panels on their roof there was a tax bill that was

[21:43] passed end of 2017 that got rid of a lot of the tax credits for solar and also when energy and then earlier this year Trump put some tariffs on imported solar panels so the back story here is that China has been cranking out lots and lots of solar panels and they've been able to produce them cheaper than the American companies have been able to

[22:14] make them so the system that we have that's been in place for the last five to ten years that China has been making the solar panels then American companies buy them and install them in the u.s. so Trump decided that he was going to put tariffs on the Chinese solar panels so that American companies might be able to compete in in making them which sounds like a good idea except what that ends up meaning is that they're so expensive that that nobody here is really buying

[22:45] them to put on their houses anymore so the actual solar industry is taking a big hit because these tariffs and we just don't have the manufacturing capacity at the moment now maybe we'll build it in the future but right now this is this has taken a big chunk out of the solar power industry in this country there's a whole history of solar panels in the White House so back in late 70s Jimmy Carter that guy was our president and he decided that he would

[23:16] have solar panels installed on the White House okay so that he was kind of this progressive alternative energy kind of guy so then a few years later we have Ronald Reagan who was very anti alternative energy he had them taken down and then fast forward a couple administrations and Obama comes along and puts them back up except there they're different the solar panels at Jimmy Carter had were for heating water Obama solar panels were for generating electricity then Trump

[23:46] gets in the office and says he wants to take the solar panels back down again but as of right now he hasn't done that yet so that's the kind of ridiculous thing we're into that it's turned into the stupid political argument where if you're a Democrat you're Pro solar if you're Republican you're anti solar and it's just dumb the whole thing is just dumb okay so there are some calculations that we can do with solar so let's say I've got some solar panels on my roof let's say I just have eight panels and

[24:16] each one is rated at a hundred watts so when you buy a solar panel they're rated in their power in wattage and let's say that the way that my house is situated I get say 12 hours of sunlight a day and we'll just for simplicity we'll just say let's imagine it's 12 hours all throughout the year okay so and we're going to assume that we're in direct sunlight so that

[24:47] each one of these is getting the full hundred watts so my question might be say how much energy do I generate in a year okay so that's the question how much energy do I generate in a year and where we're headed for this is let's say in if you know the assumption here is I'm using that energy instead of burning coal to generate that electricity how much coal do I save how much co2 do I

[25:17] save okay that's where we're headed so let's do what's calculate energy and we're gonna use the same formula that we did before energy is power times time okay so we don't know this this is what we're solving for and let's see what's the power well each one is a hundred watts but we've got eight of them and the time is 12 hours a day times 365

[25:53] days a year okay so this is gonna be our calculation so I have a hundred times eight times 12 times 365 so I get three million five hundred and four thousand watts times hours watt hours right we're

[26:25] going to convert this a kWh so I'm gonna divide by a thousand and that gets me 3504 kilowatt hours so that's how much energy I have generated on my roof with my solar panels okay so this is what I've generated okay so a question could be well how much coal did I save from burning how much coal did I not have to burn right so remember it's and we'll do in pounds

[26:57] so coal saved is this if I if this is a question and we had we had the gin we had to burn coal to do this we would multiply this by 2.2 so it's the same kind of question so 3504 kilowatt hours and it takes 2.2 pounds for every kilowatt hour so that gives me something

[27:28] to divide by a thousand times 2.2 77090 of coal saved okay so I say I prevent from you know that simple eight panel array on my roof prevents 7800 pounds of coal from being burned each year how

[28:01] much co2 do I prevent from emitting into the atmosphere I would go back to my 3500 for let's say I asked this in liters liters of co2 saved prevented from going into the atmosphere 3504 kilowatt hours and it's a thousand liters of co2 for every one kilowatt

[28:31] hour that I burned so I get the number three million five hundred four thousand liters of co2 that are saved or prevented from going into the atmosphere okay so we can do calculations like this is the same math that we've seen before okay we'll do another version of this type of problem now let's say I've got a big solar array on the roof say at UNM and it's rated at 35 kilowatts and

[29:03] let's say the building is situated so it gets 10 hours of sunlight a day and I want to know let's say in a month in 30 days how much coal does this save from being burned right so how much coal do we save with this solar array so energy

[29:35] is power times time again now here's this case so we had to deal with this in the aluminum problem sometimes it's best to get rid of the K in work out the problem and then convert to kilowatt hours at the end so here's what I mean by that K means a thousand right so 35 kilowatts is the same thing as

[30:06] thirty-five thousand watts times 10 hours times 30 days so I'm going to do that math and I have 35 thousand times 10 times 30 let's see here so I get

[30:43] ten million five hundred thousand watt hours generated in a month and now what I'm gonna do is divide by a thousand to turn it into kilowatt hours which gives me ten thousand five hundred kilowatt hours kWh in a month so with that I can

[31:13] then figure out okay well how much cold would I need multiply that by two point two so I take ten thousand five hundred times two point two and I get twenty three thousand one hundred pounds of coal in a month that I saved from this solar array so as the same math as before the only tricky part with some people is not knowing what to do with

[31:44] the K if I when the Razr is reported as K no kilowatts my recommendation is replace K with multiply this by thousand which is what I did here and then do the math and then when you get to watt hours divide by a thousand to turn it into kWh not the only way to do it so if you you feel math competent you know what's going on do it your own way but this is kind of a foolproof way of

[32:14] working through it each time so the other source of renewable energy is that of wind power so when turbines are these big wind mills that as they spin they turn magnets near conductor at the generate electricity in a similar way that a steam turbine works so if you kind of look inside there's this big white box that sits behind the blades and inside there there's a device that takes the

[32:44] very slow spinning of the blades and makes it spin faster gears it up so that you can spin magnets near a conductor pretty quickly and generate tricity the blades themselves they can turn that they can change the pitch so if it's a little bit of wind there'll be a certain position if there's a lot of wind there'll be a different position but they're always trying to turn is about the same speed no matter what the

[33:14] wind conditions are so inside of one this is kind of what it looks like going up the tower and here we are in the box behind those blades so this is the device that gears takes the very slow rotation and gears it up so it's spinning pretty quickly and then electricity comes out the other end here or the generator is so windmills are great when turbines are great because they they do as long as they're running they generate no greenhouse gases and in

[33:47] a lot of places if it's windy it might be windy every day you're getting electricity every day but there is a public backlash against wind turbines that just like there's been a public backlash against solar so here are some of the big issues some people think they're just ugly and they ruin the landscape okay though people don't like to look at them there have been complaints especially in the past that they're noisy people live near them say they you know they can't sleep they hear them all the time and also they used to kill birds so the early

[34:19] designs spun really fast and the birds would not see the blades and they'd run right into it and die so these problems have for the most part been addressed so talking about sound first you know California was one of the first states to really adopt wind technology and they did a lot of experimentation in California with different windmill designs and it's true the first ones were really noisy they spun really fast they made a lot of noise so they experimented with some different designs

[34:49] here's a two blade design here's a one blade design which looks kind of funny it's got a counterweight on the other side so it doesn't shake itself apart remember they were experimenting trying to make the quietest windmill that they could here's what we call the eggbeater design it spins vertically around an axis this way here's smaller version these vertical axis wind turbines and through trial and error eventually they settled on a design of three blades and

[35:22] they've managed over time to build these larger and larger which means that the blades can actually spend slower and if you have a blade that's spinning slower it doesn't make as much noise and the birds see it and they don't die so this three by two design is what all the wind turbines now are designed after you also notice they have a really small footprint there's a tower down here and so a lot of places where farmers have a

[35:52] lot of land they'll we sell their land to a to a wind farm and they'll continue to farm down here it doesn't really bother them so here's a size comparison looking at wind turbines since the early 80s off you can read this but this one says 1981 and at that time a big wind Mill Mariah tea would produce 55 kilowatts or 55,000 watts then by the late 80s we are seeing them

[36:22] up to two hundred thousand watts or two hundred kilowatts and they're getting taller by the year 2000 we're looking at eight hundred and fifty thousand watts or any 150 kilowatts about 2002 or at three thousand thousand watts which means three million watts or three megawatts right and and so as they make them bigger you know one of the advantages of having a very tall windmill is that the wind is faster up

[36:52] above our heads and it is at the surface so they they're in stronger wind and you have longer blades they catch more of the wind and they can spin slower and still produce a lot of power here's another image of the size comparison a 10 kilowatt windmill versus up to a three megawatt windmill the difference in the sizes and they are still planning on just making them bigger and bigger so by 2020 this publication is predicting

[37:22] we'll have a 10 megawatt 10 milli what wind turbine by then so the Telegraph in in England they did a little documentary docu documenting how noisy windmills were so what they're doing is they're going up to the quietest place they could find and they have a loudness meter a decibel meter and they're recording how many decibels

[37:52] of sound is in this location and then they go to a quiet neighborhood and again they take measurements in decibels there okay notice how slow these are spinning okay that's about how fast these windmills spin so half mile way they still can't hear it 200 yards away they notice that they're still quieter than the planes flying overhead and they

[38:24] don't really hear it till they get right up next to it a few feet away you might be able to hear it and they notice that you know an average road is way noisier than the then the wind turbines so point being they're quiet now and noise really is no longer an issue like it used to be however there's still people that hate windmills president Trump famously hates

[38:55] them because according to him they're ugly he has complained that and some of his golf courses that you can see these windmills in the distance and he doesn't like that so one of the things that companies are doing is putting windmills offshore so just a little bit out in the ocean and out there nobody can see them nobody can hear them and also the winds are much stronger and more consistent off the coast so out there they can put in some

[39:27] really big wind turbines you know these are the biggest ones that that we're currently making all these in these pictures are at least 3 million watts apiece we watch a little video that's promotional video from a company that actually puts these things together and they're basically bragging about themselves but he has a video of their offshore windfarm in 2015 mhm i Vestas

[39:59] offshore wind celebrated a track record of 20 years of experience in the offshore wind industry through our history we have installed more than 700 offshore turbines equaling more than 2 gigawatts of capacity spread over 17 wind power plants in six European markets that's enough wind power to provide energy for around 1.9 million households for every turbine installed and commissioned it has added to the unique

[40:29] bank of knowledge we now possess perfected over time and our drive for innovation has led us to become one of the industry leaders with the V 112 3.45 megawatt supplying energy to over 3,100 households in 2016 MHI Vestas will install the first V 160 for 8 megawatt turbines offshore the V 164 is the most powerful wind turbine in

[40:59] the world with a total energy output to supply more than 7,500 households the blades reach 80 metres long equivalent to nine London double-decker buses for Airbus a380s could fit within the swept area of over 21,000 square meters so not all wind turbines are gigantic like those that you just saw I homeowner can

[41:29] buy a small one especially if you are on solar you can buy them that will help complement your solar installation these would be a few hundred watts of peace they do not move slow they move very fast and they're usually pretty noisy as well so the United States is a pretty good place for wind turbines actually and the windiest part of the country is kind of right here in the middle now over the tops of most mountains is a

[41:59] good place for for installing a wind turbine so all these places that you see are kind of this beige color in here our places where people have installed wind turbines as wind goes up over a mountain but right in the middle of the country there's a root band a really strong wind that's very reliable and so if you've ever been safe you need a you know panhandle of Texas there's that I mean there's windmills being installed all over the place it's kind of amazing to

[42:29] see right now but right kind of in the middle of the country is is the best place to install windmill so we have a lot of wind in this country that we could harness so pros and cons of wind a windmill it takes resources to build it but once it's built as long as it's running no greenhouse gasses at all you can get millions of watts out of a single windmill cons they are traditionally have been pretty expensive

[42:59] but that's been coming down and cost still a public backlash against it some people just don't like the the looks of them or whatever also if you have when installing windmills on top of the ridge somewhere you know you got to run power cables up there and that can be quite expensive to just to install these things and of course you can't have windmills everywhere because it's just not windy everywhere so another source of renewable energy is that of

[43:29] geothermal energy idea being if you drill down on the earth it's going to get hot and if you live in the right spot it might get hot enough right under where you live that you can use that for hot water and if it's hot enough it might actually generate steam and you could turn a steam turbine so what are the conditions where you might get that well one is if you live somewhere where there's recent volcanic activity if you've had recent volcanic activity there's probably a blob of magma that's

[44:00] still down in the crust somewhere might be a few miles down but cold groundwater comes close to that magma body heats up and Rises back to the surface as hot water if it makes it all the way to the surface you might get a hot spring something like this and if the conditions are right you might get like a geyser something like Old Faithful something like that but this is a essentially a free source of hot water if you could figure out how to tap it so in some places like Iceland there is so

[44:32] much volcanic activity and there's so much magma in the crust that they have an endless supply of hot water and so in Iceland they actually have enough hot water hot above the boiling point that they can tap into that and just take that steam and turn a steam turbine so this is what a power plant in Iceland looks like so there's no coal there's no natural gas it's a it's a pretty simple looking thing they just take hot water out of the ground run that through a turbine generate electricity it's a

[45:03] pretty neat deal here's another one right so again all these pipes is they're bringing in the steam from underground and turning turbines Indonesia is another place so Indonesia is a bunch of islands and they're all volcanoes and so there's a decent amount of magma still under the ground they're generating hot water and so they have you know here's a big geothermal power plant same ideas Iceland taking steam and generating electricity now there's

[45:33] another way that you can make hot water underground and that is if you had friction from faulting so here's a picture showing you know sometimes the Earth's crust breaks into pieces and those pieces slide past each other and that's what they're trying to show here here's a chunk of the crust here's another chunk of the crust and there's this I've got Fault right between them and they're sliding past each other very slowly and so on the surface what we notice is that maybe every hundred years or so there's a

[46:04] little jerk and there's an earthquake but turns out way down deep it's moving a little bit every day maybe a few millimetres a little bit and that's generating friction it's making heat and cold water in contact with that gets hot in the fault zone rises to the surface and you can get a hot spring up here near the surface just because of this fault movement so anywhere you have faults you have the possibility of making hot water in one of the most famous places in the

[46:36] United States for this is Nevada so here we're looking at a was this is called the Basin and Range province all through Nevada looks like this this chunk is moving up this chunk is moving down right between here there is a fault okay and if you were to drill down in this zone you might strike hot water so here's kind of a cartoon diagram of what I mean by this so this block is moving down relatively this block is moving up

[47:07] and friction is occurring along this plane and if cold water is coming along here then it might heat up and come up you'll have hot springs up in here okay that's the idea so Nevada is in a geologic province that's being stretched apart so the crust is being is what are we being pulled apart in breaking into chunks so you can see from this view here that it's a bunch of linear looking mountains and valleys in between it's called the Basin and Range well there's a fault at

[47:39] the base on every one of those mountains and here's a map of faults and the colors tell you how fast the faults are moving in millimeters per year point being there's a lot of faults in in Nevada that are they have the potential of generating hot water so for example here's what one looks like so there's a fault nearby and there's this hot water coming up making this hot spring out in the middle of Nevada so they decided to

[48:09] try to make a geothermal power plant utilizing this hot water and so they built this in the 80s and they started to extract hot water out of the ground and before they started that power plant there was a geyser field out there in the Thatta bale Huawei geyser field so kind of like Old Faithful just not as famous and it would shoot off hot water and there's hot springs around kind of like

[48:39] I showed you in that last picture well after they started the geothermal power plant and they started extracting hot water out of the ground one of the first things that happened is that geysers stopped and then the hot springs dried up so here's a place that used to have hot springs and there's nothing there anymore and one of the problems you can see in the background if you've never been to Nevada it's super dry it's in that rain rain shadow effect from the west coast and it was just not that much

[49:09] precipitation and so there's not much replenishment of the groundwater so when they started to extract the groundwater out they just started to simply run out of water so one of the things that they did they realized early on is they have to pump that water back into the ground so the idea is they pump the hot water out they run it through the steam turbine generates electricity then they take it after it's gone through the turbine and they pump as much of it as they can back into the ground so here's

[49:41] a graph of that so this is time this is where they started this y-axis is kind of confusing this is just imagine how much water is coming out of the ground that's the red and how much water they're putting back into them into the ground that's the black so they start out there getting a lot of hot water out of the ground they're generating a lot of electricity but as time goes on they get less and less hot water out of the ground and therefore they're collect

[50:12] Rissa T their power output goes down and down as well as well so they're still generating a little electricity with it but it's not nearly as much as they thought they were going to get unfortunately it's just too dry this is the curse of geothermal resources in the United States if you look at where most of the geothermal resources should be in other words if we were to drill in the crust where would we expect to find hot water you see it all over the West right

[50:42] and the Nevada right this whole region out here that's kind of reddish and even a little bit here are places where we would expect to find heat sources under the crust but it also corresponds to places that are the driest in the country so we talked about how this is at the driest part in the country right through here over here where it rains a lot not really any geothermal resources so our country has this problem that we've got

[51:12] places that's generating heat but just not enough groundwater to really take advantage of it so New Mexico is one of these places we have a lot of volcanoes in New Mexico so in this map all the red says volcanic rocks younger than 5 million years old in geologic time that's considered a pretty young Rock 5 million years so if we have these so all this red is relatively young volcanic rocks that means there's probably still magma under the crust and we also have a

[51:44] lot of earthquakes in New Mexico this cluster right here near Socorro is due to what we call the Socorro magma body there's a blob of magma down there moving around and some of these clusters that you see are actually due to fault movement we have a lot of faults in New Mexico and this is the map of them the colors designate the different ages of them but point is is we've got faults that are moving that should generate heat we've got magma that's also

[52:16] generating heat we ought to have geothermal resources but like the like in Nevada we just don't have much groundwater and so because of our lack of groundwater and also we haven't really found really hot water in New Mexico yet here's a map of the state so the blue says temperatures below 100 degrees centigrade so that's not hot enough to boil so you're not going to get steam out of it that's the blue and

[52:46] then the red says temperatures above a hundred so in theory that would be enough to generate steam they've never really got it a well that can produce enough hot water to run out a thermal power plant though but we have used some of this warm water for other reasons so we have greenhouses in New Mexico that use geothermal hot water so it's pumped out of the ground it's already hot it heats buildings New Mexico State campus heats some of their

[53:19] buildings with warm water there are tapia fish farms that use some geothermal hot water as well too just as a source of you know warm water so we're not generating electricity with it in this in the state but we are using some geothermal resources best that we can our final renewable resource that we're going to learn about in this class is that of hydroelectricity which is the idea of forming a dam so damming up a

[53:49] river making a reservoir behind the dam and then forcing that water through the bottom of the dam so that it turns a turbine which turns a generator which makes electricity so we kind of talked about this before when we did our project with rivers and dams and reservoirs and all that and in the southwest all of those big dams that we talked about have hydroelectric power plants at the bottom of them so we looked at Hoover Dam so remember this is

[54:20] Lake Mead we're near Las Vegas and the water comes out down here and turns turbines to generate electricity so the water goes in at the bottom of these towers there's an inlet and the water goes to this big pipe that goes through the dam so this is I don't know like 100 feet below the surface something like that headed towards these big turbines and the turbines themselves are they don't look like the steam turbines in this in this case they look like giant

[54:51] boat propellers or something like that but the water goes through and turns this shaft which turns this big generator which in itself has magnetic fields in it that rotates and the this is what one of the generators looks like taken out of its housing so these things are the magnets and this is spinning around about sixty times a second so inside of hoover dam looks like this each one of these red round

[55:22] things has a generator in it so spinning inside of here are one of those rotors that you saw in the previous diagram so all said together it's making about 2,000 megawatts so 2,000 million watts now to compare that with say some of our coal-fired power plants in the u.s. so we have coal-fired power plants of all different sizes and of the biggest like

[55:53] 1500 to 2000 megawatts we've got 38 of them and over 2000 megawatts we've got 29 of them so this number 2,080 megawatts is as big as one of our biggest coal fire power plants here's another example Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State this is the Columbia River that's being dammed up this is at 6,800 megawatts and again to compare it

[56:23] would is it would produce as much electricity is about three of our equivalent biggest coal fire power plants another picture of Grand Coulee Dam while they're going over the spillway they're the world's largest hydroelectric dams in China it's called the Three Gorges Dam it took them a very long time to build it it was very controversial because they flooded cities in the process to do this has 32

[56:53] turbines makes twenty two thousand five hundred million Watts megawatts about ten of our largest coal fire power plants and it's quite a feat of engineering tremendous amount of water goes through Three Gorges Dam you can see it spans this really broad distance here across well hydroelectric power is great as long as you have water but a lot of these dams that we're talking

[57:23] about once we have in the United States are on the west coast and Southwest like like Meade and Hoover Dam here and the problem is we have been undergoing a lot of drought and we have a lot of water allocations like we talked about in the past so one of the problems were having is there is not enough water left in the reservoirs to actually run the generators to run those turbines so here's Lake Mead here's a recent

[57:53] photo and the water is so low that it's actually not even going into the pipes that lead to the generators you can see so here we're on Lake Mead here that's where the top of the lake ought to be right yeah it's like a bathtub ring you can see here very low compared to word where it should be or here's another example you can see where the shoreline is supposed to be out in here right and then the water is way down here another example this is was all underwater except for this little

[58:24] island sticking up and you can see all the land that's now sticking out of the water because of the drought situation this is a boat ramp boat boat ramp slash boat launch area marina and here's where it used to be right this is where you used to launch your boat off of this and you see it they've had to move it all the way down there so this is a problem in many of our reservoirs that have hydroelectric dams right now there's just not enough water

[58:55] to run the generators here's one from California this is what the dam looked like maybe I don't know 10 20 years ago and this is a more recent photo and you can see those pipes right there those are the turn stalks that's what takes the water from the lake and takes it down to the generators but they're high and dry they're not getting any water to generate electricity with so pros and cons making water with hydroelectric

[59:25] dams is great in terms of greenhouse gases because they just don't generate any they're just spinning around generating electricity 24 hours a day burning no fossil fuels no air pollution is being produced the cons back when we had our lecture about the problem with dams and how that changes the water temperature and the water pH and and all that stuff that still applies right blocks fish migrations all those things all that still apply so what we talked about

[59:56] before applies here as well you can't dam up a lot of rivers in most of the country in fact you need the right kind of topography and we really only have that along kind of the west part of the United States where we have a mountainous terrain and then as I just Illustrated these things are subject to drought so as long as you have water and you can run water through your turbines then that's great but if we're in the drought situation like we've been in the last 20 ish years it's getting harder

[1:00:26] and harder to actually generate electricity with this method you
