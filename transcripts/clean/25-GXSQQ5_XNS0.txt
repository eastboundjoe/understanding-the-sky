[0:06] hey guys this is Mel and this is our last lecture in which I'm going to review some of the things out of your book that are going to be on the last exam so we're gonna kind of skip around on a few topics that I think might have been a little bit confusing all of this pertains a climate change one way or the other so one of the topics that they talked about in your book was this idea of a climate model so a climate model is really a computer

[0:38] program a very complicated one in the way that we think about it is imagine if we took all of the ocean and broke it up into little cubes and then we took the surface of the land and broke it up into little squares and then we took all of the atmosphere and you broke those up into cubes now we know all of the physics that goes on inside each one of these cubes in the atmosphere and inside each one of the cubes in the ocean and

[1:10] what the process is going on inside each square over the land so for each cube in the atmosphere for example we know all the physics all the thermodynamics all the fluid dynamics etc that happens in each box and so what we do is we make a computer program that does the math that occurs within each cube in the atmosphere and also each cube in the ocean and then calculates

[1:40] what's happening between the squares on the continents and the cubes in the atmosphere so it's doing exchange calculation so here's an example I would not expect you to know what any of this math means that each cube of the atmosphere we can solve all these different things for each each single cube now if we did this by hand if we had enough time we could calculate all the conditions and all the physics that

[2:10] are going on inside one cube but we're trying to do this for the whole atmosphere so what we do is we break the atmosphere up into a bazillion little cubes and then we have a really really fast computer generally one that has many processors and we assign one processor to each cube so in other words it's like each cube gets its own little computer that's part of this big supercomputer so let's skip that one here the biggest computers the

[2:41] fastest computers in the world look something like this and this this one for a while was the fastest computer in the world it's has not been that for for some time now it was called the earth simulator and all it did was run what we call climate model so you program in all of those equations for all those boxes in the atmosphere and the ocean in the land and then you essentially you know a computer like this might have a couple

[3:12] hundred thousand processors and you sign a processor to each box and they're all solving these equations simultaneously so it takes a lot of computer power to do this and so early computer models back then they actually started this in the 70s when computers were pretty slow and then as the computers got faster our climate models got better so one of the things that has made our climate models better is the size of the boxes has

[3:42] gotten smaller so if you're trying to simulate the atmosphere if you had were giant boxes like if you subdivide the Earth's atmosphere into like 12 giant boxes that's not a very good simulation they're smaller and smaller you make the boxes the more realistic it becomes but the more calculations are required and the faster computer you need to do this and so as our computers have gotten faster our climate models have gotten better so here's an example of 1990s climate model so each Q was 270

[4:16] by 270 kilometers well that's a pretty big box and that's a that's the best they could do of the computers at the time but there could be a lot of things going on inside that box in the atmosphere that you would not be able to simulate because your box is simply too big so it when this slide was made it says present day 135 by 135 today we have climate models that can do 30 kilometer by 30 kilometer boxes and so today with today's fastest

[4:47] supercomputers we can simulate the atmosphere pretty well like we we are box the boxes are small enough and the math is tight enough that we do pretty good simulations so once you have a really good climate model that works you can do different experiments with it and this is there you have a diagram like this in your book so let me try to explain what this is a one of the IPCC diagrams so let me try to explain what they're doing here so imagine if you

[5:20] went back to say the early 1900's and you said ok we're going to change history and humans are not going to add any more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere ok so what you would do in your climate model is you would go essentially back in time and say what was the Earth's atmosphere look like today modern time if we went back to the early 1900's and we decided not to emit greenhouse gases like what would have happened and so the climate model cranks

[5:52] away at the math and all those cubes and it spits out an answer and then you can go back and say ok what would the climate be like today if we did put in greenhouse gases and the computer cranks it out and cranks out and spits out an answer and we can compare those two answers so this is kind of what they've done here so let's look at this one here that says global ok so there's a blue envelope and the blue is kind of behind the pink here from here to here and then

[6:24] there's this pink and then there's this black coin all right so they went back to the early 1900's they asked the supercomputer let's take out greenhouse gasses that humans have added called anthropogenic forcings that's what they're calling it here and let's just run this climate model and see what it does and it spits out now this is on the y-axis this is temperature anomaly and here it says zero so zero Degree temperature not only means normal right so what it says is that cranks out to

[6:55] the year 2000 when this this one was made and it says that worldwide temperatures should have followed sort of this blue envelope right here now the reason is not a single line is that there's multiple computer models that are run by multiple research groups on multiple computers and they all give a slightly different answer but the answers converge in this blue envelope here okay or you could break it out by continent like they did here in South America or Africa or whatever okay so

[7:26] then they run it again they say alright can supercomputer let's throw in some greenhouse gases and run it again and see what you get so they do that again and that's what this pink envelope is here now you can see that the temperatures would go up as we get close to the year 2000 or if we look at South America or if you look at Africa etc so then so the so the supercomputer is saying no green no anthropogenic greenhouse gases the human the ones that humans make no extra greenhouse gases

[7:57] temperatures should have done what the blue is showing with the greenhouse gases temperatures would do what the pink is showing the black is the temperatures we actually measured so these are real life temperatures that people measured with thermometers over time so what this is saying is that temperatures that we actually measured the black line correspond to the climate model outputs that predicted this map amount of warming with those extra greenhouse gases so the other way to

[8:28] think about is that if humans did not do what we did if we didn't burn fossil fuels we didn't add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere the temperatures on earth should be following the blue but instead we follow we see that they're following the pink now in a previous lecture we went through some of the reasons why we eliminated why sunspots are not the source of global warming why volcanoes are not the source of global warming what is this as sort of another piece of evidence that says the math actually checks out that the extra greenhouse

[8:59] gases do provide the amount of extra warming that we notice now for some reason in in the in climate change world the scientists use this term forcings and you may have read that a bunch in your book I don't like that term but it's very popular so forcing means you're going to add something to the atmosphere that's going to force the temperature to change okay that's what it means so if I add more co2 to the atmosphere that is a forcing it's going

[9:29] to force the the warming to occur if I have more sunspots that's another type of forcing it's going to force the climate to change so down here it says models only using natural forcings what that means is naturally occurring things sunspots volcanoes naturally-occurring greenhouse gases models using both natural and anthropogenic forcings means take all the folk a nose and sunspots and all that and then also add the greenhouse gases that humans are putting in that's what they mean that's what forcings mean it's I don't again it's a

[10:00] word that I think it's kind of confusing so recap here the blue line computer model outputs without anthropogenic greenhouse gases red computer model outputs with anthropogenic greenhouse gases black is the observed temperature so what we can say is it's very likely that the warming we're seeing is doing is due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases another way that we think about this is we've kind of eliminated all other possibilities right I mean we talked in this class about sunspots and we talked

[10:31] about volcanoes the Earth's orbit does change but not nearly as fast as well to explain the warming that we have so the cut only thing we're really left with are the greenhouse gases that we as humans have added to the atmosphere and the computer math basically says yeah that looks like the most likely explanation so the other thing that we can do with climate models is we can use them to try to predict the future so once you have a really good simulation of the atmosphere then you can ask it

[11:02] questions like well how is that how is the climate going to be different say a hundred years from now so we've got the math down and we have the programming in the COS software down but there's still one big uncertainty and the big uncertainty is we don't know what the future of greenhouse gas emissions is going to be so there's a part of your book early kind of part to it mostly where it talks about how there

[11:32] are these different scenarios that the IPCC has put together and they have these goofy names like RCP 8.5 and RCP 6.0 and so what they did is they got together and they said look we don't know what the future is gonna be like but let's say what would happen if we continue on the current path we are right now right or burning a certain amount of fossil fuels each year a little bit more each year a little bit more and let's just imagine that keeps

[12:02] on going into the future or what would happen if the countries got together and they had some kind of treaty and they said we're gonna cut greenhouse gas emissions down right and so they come up with another possible scenario like well maybe one one of these and so the best they can do is they come up with these different scenarios and they put them into the climate models and they calculate what the result would be if we went down these different paths but we don't know what path we're going to go

[12:32] down so that's what these emissions pathways are all about so in your book so here I am on page 92 and so here's a graph that says global co2 emissions in Giga tons of carbon per year and this is time so the black is our historical that's what we have humans have already done how much co2 we put into the

[13:03] atmosphere how much carbon and then here it breaks into yellow at the time that this graph was made it was a year 2000 and they were doing projections into the future so you know depending on what you know if the if the economy continues to boom and there's no regulations well we might go up red curve and then if countries get together and decided hey we should you know save the earth well maybe that's going to be the blue curve and so forth so these are the different scenarios and how the different projections played out

[13:34] into the future okay so then they asked the supercomputers - okay well if if we did say the orange curve what would the temperature of the earth be like by the time we get to the year 2100 right okay so a couple pages later here's an example of what one of these looks like so now the y-axis saw on page 98 global surface temperature change alright so up to here this is - mm like

[14:06] 2005 which is the time that they made this particular graph and RCP 8.5 that's that was the red curve on the previous one now it's this red with the pink envelope around it saying okay if the world follows the red path of that RCP 8.5 in the in the in the previous diagram how will the temperature change well it will change like this that's what the computers are telling us and

[14:37] the further out we go you can think of it this is like the the red line is sort of the center and this this is the range of uncertainty around and the more the further out you go in the future the more uncertainty you get in your prediction but what they're saying is if we follow the red path the 8.5 path then we will we will see temperatures increase well in this pink zone which if you look across here is somewhere between 3 degrees and maybe 5 degrees

[15:10] centigrade above where it should be which in Fahrenheit is five and a half degrees at night versus nine degrees and nine degrees Fahrenheit above what it should be whereas if we picked the blue one right this is the RCP 2.6 now what did what was that that was the okay that's kind of the best case scenario this is the one where we all get together as a world and we say we gotta cut co2 emissions and we actually

[15:41] make big measures probably like this would be the best possible scenario like if we all got together and we started cutting our fossil fuel consumption a lot well then that is this curve so it's gonna it predicts that temperatures will still going to increase a little bit because we already have so much co2 in the atmosphere already and they're going to kind of stabilize along this purple line so the computer models the climate models are predicting that the climate

[16:11] is going to change somewhere between you can think of this is like best-case scenario and maybe worst-case scenario although it could be even a little bit worse than this but realistically it's probably going to be between these two curves which means that by the year 2100 we're expecting temperatures to be about one degree centigrade which is close to two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal up to maybe five degrees centigrade or nine degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal so point being our

[16:43] climate prediction models are only as good as the as a prediction that we can make to our greenhouse gas emissions so what I've been doing in the in my face-to-face classes is talk about some of the history behind some of the attempts that the world you know that the world has seen that try to do something about greenhouse gases so one of the one of the things that comes out of that modeling is that if we want greenhouse gases to kind of be flat and

[17:15] stop increasing we actually have to start decreasing our greenhouse gas emissions because there's so much greenhouse gas emissions that are already up into the atmosphere so one day the big attempts was something called the Kyoto Protocol and this was adopted in 97 and then countries started to follow it and you think of it like a treaty when two countries getting together signing a treaty to say we're gonna start lowering our co2 emissions and originally had

[17:45] hundred ninety-two countries everybody signing on thinking about how they're gonna cut greenhouse gases but then in 2001 the u.s. drops out says well we're not signing on to this and so we dropped out of this particular treaty and then more recently there was another attempt called the climb espera de Paris climate Accord and they were trying to limit the future temperature increases to about one and a

[18:15] half degrees centigrade which again means you gotta cut down those co2 emissions 195 countries signed on as of 2015 and as soon as Trump got in office that was kind of one the first things he did is he said we're out of the Paris climate Accord and so now we've dropped out so the problem with these treaties is it's kind of a volunteer thing countries get together they sign on but no one's forcing you to stay so the u.s. just left and in the problem with that

[18:47] is historically the US has been the number one contributor in greenhouse gas emissions now today we're actually number two China has taken the world as the number one co2 emitter now if you add up a whole bunch of other countries together you get a big chunk too but the three Biggie's are China US and the European Union and enfold you know by a bunch of other countries so you know when we drop out we're like a major contributor to these to the

[19:20] greenhouse gas emissions and then once we drop out then the other countries are saying well why are we gonna do this if the u.s. is not going to do it if you look at keywords have co2 emissions in the past 150 years so this is not the amount that we're emitting today this is like all the co2 we've emitted since you know late 1800s you see that the number one by far is the United States and then surprisingly number two is Germany and the number three is China okay so historically we've been the

[19:52] biggest emitter and so when we drop out of these treaties that kind of looks bad for the United States and then of course without going political we have to talk about the current political climate which is that we currently have an administration that thinks that global warming is not even real so this is a famous tweet from Donald Trump concept the global warming was created by and for the Chinese in

[20:22] order to make the US manufacturing non-competitive so he's famously as has said that he thinks everything I've been telling you is is a hoax that the Chinese government made up so with that and with the fact that we have the head of the EPA Scott Pruett also is a firm non believer in climate changed that it doesn't look like we're going to be signing on any co2 treaties in the near future so the reason I'm bringing this up is

[20:54] when we're trying to make these predictions these types of curves right now based on the current political climate we're headed up this curve right this is this is the one we're headed up right now now let's say in a couple years all the current administration is thrown out of office and a new group comes in and they say you know what we're all about solar energy we're all about wind power we're gonna we're going to tax the fossil fuels whatever you know whatever the scenario is maybe

[21:24] that'll suddenly shift us and we'll be on the blue path and maybe we'll be on the blue path for four years and then they get kicked out of office and then another bunch of fossil fuel proponents come in then we're shifting back to the the black curve again so this is why it's so hard to predict right over the last few years we've been headed up the black curve maybe it'll change maybe it won't or what if there's a big worldwide economic crash so we had one in 2008 the amount of greenhouse gas has

[21:55] started to go down because there was less manufacturing because people were buying less because we had less money that could happen again right so so it's really hard to predict the features so this is why it's hard to predict the climate change that's actually going to occur in the next a hundred years or so let's look at a couple examples of one of these climate model predictions so the first one we're going to look at is our CP 2.6 all right so from your book this is the one where the country's

[22:27] the whole world gets together realizes the error of their ways and significantly restricts greenhouse gas emissions right I mean it's really not realistic but let's just say that the co2 emission curve looks like this it goes down into the future and so the year 2100 all right what would the temperatures look like on earth so this is the what we're gonna look at here is the output of a model

[22:57] where were we are looking at the globe of the earth and we're gonna know this one was run you know almost 10 years ago 2009 and it did a prediction is that if the world follows this RCP 2.6 emissions curve what do we get and the colors tell us the temperature change in in this case it's in Fahrenheit in the future okay so we'll play this and so as years

[23:27] go by here you can see that most of the warming is occurring in the northern hemisphere and over the continents which is what we've seen before and I'm gonna stop it when we get to the year 2100 ooh so if I go back a little bit there so most of the warming is occurring up near the Arctic right and if you think back a few lectures when we looked at the maps

[23:57] of current warming the warming that we've seen in the last hundred years we see the most warming up here and what this model is saying is that in the future that's going to continue now remember this is like an unrealistic best-case scenario that that all you know all the countries get together big kumbaya we're gonna save the world we're gonna cut co2 emissions and yet still we see temperature increases up here kind of around seven to ten degree Fahrenheit

[24:28] mark so that means seven to ten degrees Fahrenheit above what it's supposed to be okay so now let's compare that to another one of the curves okay so let's compare that so we just saw the result the model output of this future RCP 2.6 well let's go to the other extreme let's look at the 8.5 which in a previous slide was the black

[24:59] curve and in your book it's red but this is the scenario that basically we're currently on right we're headed up this red curve if nothing else changes alright so we're gonna play another one of those movies and it's just like the previous one except now we have different emission scenario so first the pattern looks pretty similar we're seeing more warming over the continents than the oceans more warming over the northern hemisphere

[25:30] than the rest but notice how much redder these colors are right how much darker they are so I'm gonna try to pause this one and notice the reddest part up here in the Arctic that's 25 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and this is the thing that you've got to keep in mind when we do climate predictions climate model predictions in the future it's always given as a global so in other words people say well the earth is going

[26:00] to warm by two degrees or three degrees you think what's two or three degrees who cares but that's a global average and remember that a lot of the earth like out in the ocean along the equator is not changing that much but in this scenario they again the eight point five scenario you've got areas up here in the Arctic that have increased by twenty five degrees Fahrenheit above average so that's huge and we also see big

[26:30] increases over land masses in the northern hemisphere too right so up here in northern Siberia you know increases of degrees Farenheit so these are crazy numbers so the patterns that the climate models are showing are the same kinds of patterns that we've been seeing in the previous maps of climate change today more climate warming in the in the northern hemisphere and more over the continents and the oceans it's just kind of a matter of degree right so this

[27:00] scenario here the eight-point-five scenario again that's business what they call business as usual it's sort of the path that we're on is the one that has the the most warming the first one I showed you which was the 2.6 that's like best-case scenario and they're still predicted to be some warming in the northern hemisphere and over the oceans so a major misconception that people have about global warming on both sides

[27:33] those that actually believe that it's happening and those that deny that it's happening or don't believe that it's happening is as follows so we talked about in the past lecture about the roz be waivers right so here what I'm looking at is I'm looking at temperatures at the 700 million bar level which is about 10,000 feet above sea level and we talked about how there's a very distinct boundary between the warmest air and the much colder air and that boundary is wavy those are the

[28:05] rows B waves and they move right okay so let's say I assume this is just from today and if you remember back till we talked about mid latitude cyclones and fronts what we were saying is that these two different air masses mix up together so right now you've got a blob a pretty cold air moving down south here and you've got warm air that's moving up to the north and here and up in here okay so let's think about what two people two

[28:36] different people might be experiencing right now if you live here you you are experiencing below normal temperatures today because this cold air from the north is coming down if you have here you are experiencing warmer temperatures than normal because this warm air is moving up to the north right so we got cold fronts and warm fronts we talked about this in past lectures if you didn't know anything about the weather

[29:06] and you lived right here you might be thinking oh where we are above normal temperatures and if you live it over here you're below normal temperatures and if you wanted to you might try to attribute that to global warming or not so in other words the person that's right here might be saying oh this global warming it's so warm today right but the reason it's warm today has nothing to do with global warming it's because they are in this warm air mass

[29:36] that's moving to the north and these people here might be thinking ah global warming is a hoax because think look how cold it is today but it has nothing to do with global warming or not it's just that they are in this pool of cold air sinking down from the from the north this is what happens over and over in the discussion about global warming every day around the world there are places that are below average temperature and there are places that are above average temperature it's all

[30:07] happens all the time and if we look around the you know if I look just what's happening today here's a place where this cold air coming down warm air going up so again if you lived over here you are below average temperatures if you lived here you're above average right if I go over here here's another one this is a blob of cold air they're below average this right here is above average over here these guys are above average these guys are below average so normally

[30:37] when you go around the world you see a bunch of zones that are above average and you see a bunch of zones that are below average and they even out like mathematically all of this should kind of equal itself out and you should have an earth that's just average with global warming what we're talking about is that average is very slowly creeping up and up but I bring this up because it comes up in the news a lot where people will say oh it's so hot today it's that

[31:08] global warming no that's not vogel warming means it's not a day-to-day thing that you can recognize it's a long-term trend or politicians will say oh it's cold and it's snowing out here and it's May global warming must be a hoax no you're mixing up two different air masses has nothing to do with global warming so people that are both believe in it and that people that don't believe in it still use this erroneously as an argument on either side so one way to think about global warming is to think

[31:40] about a bell curve most places where you live on earth especially once you get away from the equator and you're up in higher latitudes is that for any particular place we have a number of days you we've got a few hot super hot days we've got a few super cold days and everything else kind of fits into a bell curve and the bell curve might be extra fat it might be extra narrow just depends on the climate of where you live but the point is most of our days kind of fall

[32:11] in here with a few extremes over here and a few extremes over here so I'm gonna draw a little line here to represent hot outliers and cold outliers right so so this zone right here you might consider this like your heat waves right these are your you're really hot events where you know some people die from exposure to heat makes the news etc

[32:42] okay so you expect that there's there's gonna be a few maybe record-breaking cold events a few record-breaking hot events but most days are kind of in the middle now let's say I shift the climate just a couple of degrees right it's the earth gets warmer three degrees what's the big deal three degrees it might be warmer three degrees tomorrow might be colder three degrees tomorrow nobody knows the difference who cares what that really means first of all it's a global

[33:13] average so as we saw in the previous section parts of the earth are going to get much much much warmer than that that three degrees whereas a lot of it may be around the equator doesn't change at all but let's just say for this particular location I increase the temperature three degrees what that means is that this whole curve is being shifted over three degrees okay so I'm going to redraw this but as a dotted line now or it's been shifted over

[33:50] okay so this right here that's our three degree increase okay so we've shifted the average over three degrees what does that do to these extremes though these tails notice what happens to our tail of cold events on this new dashed line we basically don't have them anymore

[34:20] we're losing those cold events the record-breaking cold events when you did your climate change assignment where you went and you look one of the things that we saw when we go back like a hundred years is that starting like in the 90s we start losing those colder winters right well this is this is why now the other thing that happens is how many of these hot events do we now have so if I shifted this curve over I now have a much broader area of these hot

[34:55] events so by just shifting this over a little bit I increase the area under the curve for this tail and I decrease the area under the curve for this tail so as humans what this means is we get a lot more of these dangerous hot events a lot more of these heat waves so this is why it's a little deceptive when people say temperature's increases three degrees Fahrenheit natural reaction is big deal but it's the whole average that's shifting three degrees and it's this

[35:27] tail that we worry about because now we've got more of these hot de Vence than we used to have so we can already see the consequence of these additional heat events around the world and one thing to keep in mind when we talk about climate change is that the people who are the most affected are not us here in the United States and we have this we're kind of spoiled with our infrastructure right if so if it's extra hot we just turn on our air conditioners on but a lot of the world can't do that and it's

[35:58] kind of astonishing how many people die from these extreme heat events so these slides I'm going to show you or just some stories from 2015 I could update them and give you some more stories for this year but these are the slides that I had and so for example in 2015 you know heatwave in India kills over 2,000 people right like that's nuts we would never see something like that here in the US Pakistan heatwave that same year kills 1200 people you know that we

[36:32] didn't get into heat index in this country or in this class but if you have high relative humidities and you add to that high temperatures you can produce you know it feels like it's hotter than it really is and we call that heat index so that year Iran hit 163 degrees heat index so what that means it is it felt like there's a hundred sixty-three degrees outside so that was a combination of the high temperatures and

[37:03] high humidity that they had heat wave hit Europe people died again but not in the numbers that we saw in some of those other countries hits Japan when this story was run that 55 people died eventually that would become 90 so heat waves are you know have real-world consequences and thousands of people actually died from these each year also another consequence of climate change is

[37:33] that you're getting flooding in places that aren't used to it you're also to be fair getting droughts in place that aren't places that aren't used to it as we kind of briefly talked about in the past we're shifting weather patterns around a little bit as we change the climate and so there's human consequences for these flooding events where you know millions of people are having to leave their homes and there are death tolls and in the hundreds often or these places flood and again we're not really used to this I mean how

[38:06] far back do you have to go to find you know a hundred people in the United States died from the flood doesn't happen very often but in other parts of the world you're not nearly as lucky all so getting flooding in places that you'd never expect much rain at all so again this is the all these stories worth from 2015 and in Egypt Alexandria so the caption says Alexandria would usually only expect to see five millimeters of rain during the entire month right and

[38:37] this one event they got you know what equivalent of several inches of rain that flooded this area so many centimeters of rain now we saw this image once before which is a record of number of hours of flooding per year in a neighborhood near the coast and we talked about how this is partly due to rising sea levels you know there are several places in the world where the land is pretty close to sea level and Bangladesh is one of them and we

[39:09] expected 17% of the landmass of Bangladesh will be underwater in the next 40 years and that's going to displace 18 million people all right so this is a country that's you know it's built on a delta it's very flat very near sea level so the sea goes up just a little bit - floods a very broad area 40 I mean 18 million people that's a lot of people are gonna have to go somewhere this woman is standing where her house used to be before it got washed away

[39:39] another consequence of climate change and by the way we're just going through you know these are things that are in your book that your book talks about and in like the first half of your book or whatever more wildfire so the warmer you make the earth the lower the relative humidity the lower the relative humidity the more chance of fires and so again this is I went through is these slides this one in particular year 2015 and just got all the stories about the

[40:09] record-breaking wildfires and I could do this the year after the year after the year after and you still get the same stories so this on this particular year we had record-breaking wildfires burning eight million acres northwest wildfire fires northwestern us that is break records for size and cost The Australian's battle the worst bush fires for last 30 years and so again pretty much every year it's the same

[40:40] cycle and news stories that are coming out here's kind of a strange graph is this is from Australia and it says number of days hotter than 99% of all days ever recorded right so if we go back to the 40's right so like this year right here on what that is 1936 they had five days that year that were hotter than 99% of all days ever recorded and then compared

[41:12] and again remember long-term changes is what we're looking for in for climate change there's you know years that are clearly hotter and years that are clearly colder but the overall trend is that they're seeing more and more of these years where they have more and more record-breaking hot days right so this last one on this graph you know they looks like they've got about 27 days that were hotter than 99% of all days ever recorded so sometimes people

[41:43] use this term extreme weather I don't like that term because who knows exactly what you consider extreme but I know this gets in the news a lot and I think your book refers to it so I throw this in here the number of extreme weather events has been going up and up this is again usually attributed to climate change but it's a little fuzzy as to exactly what's going on here and what counts as extreme weather so I don't really like to get into that too much but I thought I would throw that in there so a more important idea is the

[42:16] threats to agriculture and the world's food supply and one of the things we've got to realize here is that here in the United States we've got this factory farming system we're making more food than we can use and we export a lot of it but a lot of the world does not have that and in fact the the farmers that are going to experience you know the worst consequences from climate change are the little farmers so here stars as small farmers in Africa will

[42:46] experience the worst of climate change small holders with less than five acres produce much of the world Lord's food and and so when you have a shifting you know shifting precipitation patterns or it's now it's getting warm more of these warm events you're gonna see a lot of crop failure ah on a small scale so in other words here in the United States if we go into a drought well we could drill a well we could pump water right I mean there's things that we can do but a lot

[43:18] of the world can't do that they don't have the infrastructure to do that so so we're gonna see a lot of crop failure and the places that can't afford it the most and it's worth pointing out that the world is not necessarily getting as much to eat as they would like and this is again something that we don't think about a lot in our country this is a map of hunger so white means you got plenty to eat no problem the dark green means that maybe there's a few you know maybe five percent or so

[43:49] or less of the population that's not getting enough to eat and then as you start to get into these other colors you start to get I come into the red where over 20 percent of the population is basically starving and you so you see a lot of hunger say in central Africa well we just said that that's the part of the world that's going to be the meal the most danger most at risk for crop failure as climate change starts to set in so you're taking us an area of the

[44:20] world that's already hurting for a food supply and you're gonna make it worse once you start changing precipitation patterns and adding these additional heat events number 6 on our list would be threats to livelihood and so we saw in those previous climate animate climate change animations that the predictions that the northern you know up in the Arctic that that part is going to be affected the most most of all by

[44:50] future climate change has already received the most change up till now and it's going to contain that way in the future so there's a lot of coaches like the Inuit that their livelihood depends on the present say of ice and they're gonna have to do something different because that ice is no longer gonna be there and we saw in that one prediction that it was going to you know this area was gonna increase by 25 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100 so something's gonna have to really

[45:21] change here in the in their livelihood in the okay last on our list of consequences of climate change are threats to ecosystems and this diagram was in your book and it's kind of confusing I want to go over this a little bit so the idea is that groups of organisms can migrate and part of this is common sense that if you're a big animal and you need to move you just get up and go but other groups of organisms can also migrate at a much lower rate so

[45:55] for example trees can migrate now how would they do that well tree grows up propagate seeds the seeds then start a new tree which then propagates seeds which in start a new tree in that forest as a whole could move in one direction or the other if it had to and so if you look at a range on this graph of all trees the slowest trees could propagate so on the waxes that says maximum speed at which species

[46:26] can move in kilometers per decade right so this is 20 so right in the middle of be about 10 so this bar represents all trees in the world and the speediest trees looks like they could propagate it maybe 15 kilometers per decade slows trees maybe I don't know half a kilometer per decade something like that the black bar is what is the median so you can think like that's where most trees are so it looks like most trees might be able to propagate about a kilometer per decade right so if you got

[46:58] a compa trees and they've got to stay in a certain temperature range to survive and then the climate is going to change could the trees move fast enough to get to a cooler area to survive or any of these other organisms right so if you think of like a squirrel so a squirrel could get up and and go except it has to stay within its habitat in order to survive right so let's say you got a compa trees and

[47:29] surrounding the clump of trees is I don't know a prairie and for whatever reason the squirrels have to live in the trees well the squirrels cannot migrate any faster than the trees so the trees are slowly propagating in one direction then the squirrels are propagating at the same speed as the trees right they can't go any faster than the trees or they will run out of habitat so let's imagine I have two clumps of trees here I've got one clump that's on a pretty flat you know pretty flat ground I get

[48:00] another clump that's near some pretty steep terrain so if I change the temperature I make things warmer so if these trees are going to survive they need to get to a higher elevation okay so these guys don't have to maybe they only have to go up just a little bit maybe to here to get to the cooler temperature and then there would be fine right so maybe this this batch only has

[48:32] to migrate up to here let's say and they'll be in cooler temperatures and they'll be fine this group has to go up you know to get this change in elevation let's say it's a centimeter on my map maybe that means that this group has got to get to about here to be the same distance you know that same increase in elevation to get to here so that they can survive but of

[49:02] course this is a very long area for them to migrate so the point is is if you have a group of organisms or forest that's on flat land they're going to have to travel a much longer distance to get to a cooler temperature then if you had a group of organisms that would say on the side of the hill these guys don't have to go very far to get to higher to get to higher elevation for the cooler temperatures this groups got to go much farther to get to an equivalent elevation gain okay so with that idea

[49:35] let's go back to this graph so we're going back to these our CP predictions right the scenarios the emission scenarios so if I had a our CP 2.6 remember that's the best possible scenario that's this in your book it's the purple one on here what it says is if we had our CP 2.6 it says fought areas in global average this is the rate at which the earth is going to warm and

[50:05] what we see is pretty much most of the organisms on this graph can migrate faster than that so that's good news the earth is going to warm a little bit but most most organisms including those on flat areas will be able to go faster than the warming and will survive but let's say we have our CP 6.0 so back on here our CP 6.0 that is the orange one okay and so this is not as Extreme as

[50:37] the sort of business as usual scenario 8.5 it's somewhere in between so let's just say that this is the future our CP 6.0 that's the emission scenario that happens and the earth warms up accordingly and so what this is saying it says our CP 6.0 global average this is the rate at which the earth will warm and organisms that are below this line

[51:08] will not be able to move fast enough to escape the warming organisms that are above this line will be able to go fast enough to get to to cooler areas so of all the trees in the world the trees that fall up in this zone will be able to accelerate fast enough to go beat you know to get to higher elevations to cooler temperatures the the trees that are below us all the species below here won't be able to do that and will we go extinct up here says RCP 6.0 flat

[51:41] areas so any organisms that are stuck out in the in the flat areas there they're in trouble because they're not going to be able to accelerate the the warming fast enough so all these guys would go extinct in that scenario if they were stuck out in the flattens in the flat areas these types of organisms would be okay because they could conceivably move faster than this amount of warming or if you go to the 8.5 remember the 8.5 that's the worst case

[52:11] scenario that's the business-as-usual that's the one we're probably on right now so we move from this line to this line so again any organisms that fall below this red line means that they were not going to move fast enough to outpace the warming and then here's the flat area so any organisms that's out on the flat area below this line will not survive so that's I think is kind of a confusing diagram to explain this but all you got to know here is that

[52:42] different groups of organisms can migrate at different speeds sometimes it's just the speed of the organism itself it can just pick up and walk off sometimes it's the speed of the habitat in which the organism lives so again if you're a squirrel and you live in the trees you can oil migrate as fast as the trees at the forest itself is migrating and in these different emission scenarios the earth is going to warm at different rates and so the question is as a group of organisms can you outpace the warming and to get to a

[53:13] cooler area in time if you live near a hill high elevation it doesn't take as long to get to up to a cooler spot if you live where it's flat you got a long ways to go to finally get to say a higher latitude or something you have a much much lower chance of surviving there's one graph on your book on page 50 that is pretty important but I don't think they quite point out how important it is so what it's showing is that's

[53:43] showing global average temperatures back to 20,000 BC and you see that they rise up we're coming out an ice age and then and by the way the ice age was due to changes in the Earth's orbit right but that happens very slowly and then there's this thing it says the Holocene maximum and you see it kind of dive down a little bit and all of a sudden it takes off and this is you know the trajectory that we're on okay so the point of this is that the

[54:13] amount of warming that we're seeing right now is very rapid compared to what we've seen in the past but I want to talk about this part of the graph and in I'm going to show you a different version of this and this is the graph that I generally show my class and there's some confusing things here so let's just simplify on the y-axis think of this is temperature okay something called Delta o-18 in it's something that's chemically

[54:44] removed from shells to reconstruct temperatures does not worry about that point is if you go back these are this is a hundred thousand years ago right 80 thousand years ago we see some pretty crazy changes in the Earth's climate right we've got warm periods we got cold periods we got back to warm periods so what you might say is that we're kind of in these you know ice ages or in between ice ages and there's a lot of craziness

[55:16] right a lot of wild swings in the Earth's or in the Earth's climate and we don't necessarily all agree on what's causing these big swings in the Earth's climate some of its orbit some of it may not be but here's the strange thing about 10,000 years ago the climate suddenly gets really calm and it gets and it turns flat okay and we are living at the end of this flat zone now as

[55:47] humans we need agriculture to survive and it turns out that the beginning of Agriculture was about 10,000 years ago and there's a hypothesis that humans could not develop culture until the climate kind of settled down so we went so the earth ghost is pretty crazy period and then for whatever reason tends to calm down and again climate scientists are not a hundred percent certain why why this

[56:19] actually happened why did we go creek from crazy town to this kind of nice calm period but here's the fear the fear is as we talked about in the previous lecture about greenhouse gases that we've suddenly just injected a ton of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that aren't supposed to be there and we've put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere now than the earth has seen in the last million years so the analogy is often that we're poking a sleeping

[56:50] bear right the atmosphere was going along just fine climate was nice and kind of flat no crazy stuff and then the humans come along and they start adding all this co2 and other greenhouse gases and one of the big big questions that we have is climate scientists and the public doesn't really ever this has really never discussed is we don't know what's keeping the climate that constant over the past 10,000 years and we

[57:21] especially don't know how it's going to react to all of this extra greenhouse gases when we poke the bear what is going to happen and it's quite possible that the climate system could return to crazytown over here again and we just don't know in our climate models that we've we've been talking about we you know and all the tools that we have as climate scientists there's still a level uncertainty of what is actually going to happen in the future it's pretty easy to

[57:52] predict that things will get warmer what we don't know is whether things will come crashing down soon after like it did in the past so the biggest fear about climate change and again this is not really something that most people you know that the public doesn't know about this too much that's not really in the news it's not even that much in your book is that we don't know how along this calm period this last 10,000 year long calm period we don't know how

[58:22] long this is gonna last and we don't know what its gonna happen after that but we're pretty sure that if we keep adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere that something is probably going to change we just don't know how it's going to change so I've talked from time to time about how climate change is very politicized and I thought I'd in this class talking a little bit more about that because you may not realize quite what's what's been going on so I I

[58:54] work with a lot of teachers in New Mexico like K through 12 teachers and in K through 12 they're supposed to teach weather and climate that's part of the new science standards and I work with some teachers to try to help them understand weather and climate better so that they can teach it so this is a book that many of my teachers have received in the mail and it says why scientists disagree about global warming so the title by itself is a huge lie because

[59:24] I'm a client climate scientist I've gone to many climate scientist meetings where there might be thousands of scientists present nobody's disagreeing that global warming is happening what we disagree about are they are the minut details especially like projections into the future so by the year 2100 how much is it how much is the temperature going to change that's where the disagreement lies or maybe when we look at paleo climate and we see shifts in the climate

[59:54] like a hundred thousand years ago you know we disagree about the reasons for that no one's disagreeing about what's happening today okay so the title is an outright lie and you'll also see that this second sentence is there's a little trickery afoot here it says the nipcc report on scientific consensus remember the IPCC we learned who they were so this is the n IPCC the not the IPCC but this book was printed up by a conservative group

[1:00:25] and distributed to they printed up over a hundred thousand of them and they tried to mail into every teach in the country and the whole point is to generate misinformation about climate change and to tried to produce doubt in the teachers that are actually supposed to be teaching the students about weather and climate so this is an example of some of the misinformation that's going on there's a lot of money in the fossil fuel industry that are trying to fight the the scientists that

[1:00:56] are trying to get the message out about climate change this is one example so a lot of the things that are going on for example they hired a lot of the same people that were represented tobacco companies in the 1980s so in the 1980s is kind of when people finally realized that smoking was really bad for you and they had all these scientists from the tobacco companies that were saying no no smoking's fine for you fine for you and there was a lot of misinformation that was generated to try to convince people

[1:01:27] that maybe smoking really wasn't bad for you a lot of those same people are actually now being hired to do this kind of work trying to refute climate change research you know all of the lectures that you've watched here have been posted on YouTube and usually I post one up and you guys watch it and maybe a few other people watch it and maybe there's a comment or two or usually there's no comments at all because I mean who cares right it's some guy in this cat talking

[1:01:58] about humidity nobody cares but as soon as I put the word climate change in the lecture title everything changed and so a couple of lectures ago we had I had a lecture up about that just kind of reviewing stuff out of your book and had the word climate change in the title and all of a sudden this army of trolls just came out of the woodwork and started making comments on my my lecture and all

[1:02:28] of my other videos and started sending harassing emails messages to me and finally I had to actually hide a lot of our videos from in this class so that they couldn't comment on them and then also lay down with me and then also prevent them from leaving comments and just everything changed like as soon as I used as soon as I put in the words climate change or global warming then all these people came out that this whole army trolls came out to

[1:02:59] attack me and attack this class so that's that's the world we're currently living in and maybe in a different administration that might change I suspect that it probably won't change for a long time but realize that this is a this is a topic that's highly politically charged and there's a lot of money to try to convince you that global warming isn't real and that burning fossil fuels is not a problem Romy's getting irritated so I guess

[1:03:30] we're done with this class and thank you for for listening and watching all these videos and I hope you got something out of it and I think we're done Rumi I think we're done you
